dialogue
good isnt it
is there a problem
iko was just telling me he didnt get enough to eat
i see cause another disturbance and ill see to it youre not fed the rest of this journey do you understand
boche and ledara
what did you say
your children
how did you know that
are you sure theyre safe
some people dont understand why we deal so harshly with men like you its because you never learn
stand down stand down
he needs to be disciplined
lower your weapons and step away
our response was justified
how do you justify beating a defenceless man
violence is the only thing he understands
you seem to have a pretty good grasp of it yourself
do not presume to tell me how to handle my prisoners captain you dont know iko like i do he killed a young father for no reason before that he committed dozens of violent crimes he spent his entire life hurting people
that doesnt excuse what you did to him until your transport vessel gets here you and your men wont be allowed in the cargo bay youre in charge of the prisoners
aye captain
theyre my responsibility
not as long as youre aboard my ship i wont risk any more violence
the only risk will be to your crew commander tuvok isnt qualified to guard prisoners this dangerous
tuvok has been a starfleet security officer for a very long time believe me hes qualified
i hope youre right
you remember mister iko
vividly
the nygeans decided to make an example of him
did you call me here to make a point about nygean barbarity
i called you here because i need your help to save his life he sustained a severe blow to the head which has caused severe oedema in his parietal lobe its blocking vital neurotransmitters id like to programme some of your nanoprobes to bypass the oedema
ill comply
i sense a but coming
it seems inefficient to save the life of someone whos about to be executed
if the nygeans insist on killing him there isnt much i can do about it but i wont let them do it on voyager
i didnt expect to see you back so soon ordinarily were lucky to get one meal a day
thats terrible
yediq likes to keep us hungry
less talk were hungry
youre wondering why im here
excuse me
youre wondering what i did to end up with men like them
you killed someone
thats right
why
because im benkaran
what does that have to do with it
its common knowledge that all benkarans are criminals so when i was found in the vicinity of a murder i was immediately arrested
are you saying you didnt do it
i told you im benkaran what i say doesnt matter
you suffered severe neurological trauma but i believe weve repaired the damage
thank you
dont thank me thank seven of nine she donated the nanoprobes that saved your life
oh my head
the pain is normal ill prepare an analgesic
youre not afraid of me
theres no reason to fear someone in your condition
you were never afraid of me not even when i tried to kill you its nice to look into someones eyes and not see fear
you have to be a criminal to get something to eat around here
sorry dinner will be ready in fifteen minutes
you said that fifteen minutes ago
did you know the nygeans govern a sector of space occupied by several different humanoid species
if we say yes will you feed us
one of those species is the benkarans they occupy just ten percent of nygean space but take up nearly eighty percent of the space in nygean prisons
maybe they commit more crimes
not according to joleg one of the prisoners
you think he was given a harsher sentence because of his species
according to this benkarans are ten times more likely to be executed for their crimes than nygeans
whered you get that
i contacted the nygean government told them i was interested in a cultural exchange among other things they let me access data on their criminal justice system it all supports what joleg told me
neelix
i know what youre thinking
that youre the softest touch in the delta quadrant
these are the transcripts from jolegs trial he was convicted on circumstantial evidence
let me guess he was in the wrong place at the wrong time
apparently
neelix when i was in the federation penal colony everybody had a story i never put much stock in them neither should you
how many of those people were sentenced to die
i still dont understand why werent you hurt
because my matrix is photonic im made of light
you wanted to see me
ill be with you in just a moment
you dont feel pain
well i suppose my pride has been wounded on occasion
i wish i was made of light
try to rest
mister iko responded so well to the first dose of nanoprobes i thought a second might improve his condition further itll only take a moment to extract them
you and mister iko seem to be getting along well
its the strangest thing when he first arrived he was crude abusive now hes a model patient grateful considerate
hes obviously an unstable individual inconsistent behaviour is hardly surprising
still if it werent for the security detail id forget he was a criminal
its possible hes trying to manipulate you
doctor
whats the matter
my stomach
im not detecting anything
i i cant
whats wrong
i cant stop thinking about the man i killed
thats not surprising youre experiencing guilt
is that why im feeling sick
nausea could be a symptom of guilt
ive never felt guilty before
youve committed many crimes
none of them made me feel like this why did you do this to me
were not responsible for your guilt
i didnt feel this way until you put those nanoprobes in me you knew this would happen didnt you this is some kind of punishment take the nanoprobes out
you could die
please i dont want to feel this way anymore
you dont honestly believe were responsible for his condition
we applied the borg technology its possible there were some unforeseen side effects
guilt for example
look at this
what
its my most recent scan the neurotransmitters have established new pathways throughout his cortex
wasnt that your intention
no i was simply trying to bypass the oedema
then how did this happen
i dont know its possible this is normal nygean brain activity but i have no basis for comparison
you should ask mister yediq to contact a nygean medical official maybe they could provide some relevant information
seven of nine stay and talk to me
im extremely busy
please im scared
what did you want to discuss im due in astrometrics so if theres
astrometrics whats that
a laboratory where we observe stellar phenomena
when i was a child id lie under the stars for hours id stare at them until i could see the shapes
shapes
faces and animals made out of stars
youre referring to constellations
i named them there was paedos the warrior and gezid the beast no matter how hard he tried paedos could never catch gezid
because the distance between them always remained the same
youve seen them
possibly ive catalogued approximately six billion stars
then you must have seen onella too the mother
describe her
she was surrounded by sixteen smaller stars her daughters if i try i think i can remember all their names
eleven six green
whats going on over there
kotkot
thats kadiskot congratulations
down here
ive been doing some research on the nygean legal system you were right about the benkarans receiving harsher sentences i saw the statistics
the statistics wont save me
i noticed some people convicted of murder even terrible premeditated murders werent executed some arent punished at all but you were sentenced to death
thats what the family wants
the family
after youre convicted the family of the victim sentences you
well shouldnt you be sentenced by someone less partial like a judge
vekto valek kvadim its ancient nygean it means favour the victims what if i stole your game board what right would a judge have to assign value to your loss to him its just a game board but to you it might be a priceless family possession and what if i murdered your child
i think i get your point
vekto valek kvadim its the basis for the nygean legal system
what about the criminals that didnt serve any sentence at all
some people prefer restitution to revenge if a defendant is wealthy enough he can negotiate a settlement with the victims family
oh that doesnt seem fair
its perfectly fair unless youre destitute
maybe i can talk to the captain about finding a way to compensate your victims
im grateful but it would imply im guilty i wouldnt want that
there must be something i can do
you can transmit a letter to my brother id like to let him know whats happened to me
ill get a padd
i thought you might find this interesting
what is it
its an astrometrics log it contains data on various star formations
its just words and numbers id rather look at the stars
ill bring you a star chart after my next shift
whats the metal above your eye
its a cybernetic implant
where did you get it
it was installed by the borg
it must have hurt
i dont recall
i hurt people i deserve to die
seven i found something
this is a scan depicting a healthy nygean brain this node is analogous to the human pineal gland in addition to controlling behavioural impulses it regulates decision making you might say its the physiological equivalent of a conscience
normally the node connects to the rest of the brain through a series of neural pathways
now look at this scan of ikos node before we applied the nanoprobes its detached
did that happen when he was assaulted
no i believe its congenital a birth defect
without the node iko would have been prone to violence and sociopathic behaviour all his life
when i used sevens nanoprobes to treat the injuries from the assault it seems they inadvertently repaired the defect as well
youve activated his conscience well that would explain why hes suddenly experiencing guilt
theres more to it than that i believe hes become capable of controlling his violent impulses
capable maybe but how do you know he will
even the thought of violence makes him ill now in my opinion hes no longer a threat to anyone
by some definitions captain hes not the same man who committed the murder
are you suggesting we release him
of course not but at the very least his case should be reexamined
because hes sorry
theres new medical evidence to be considered
none of it changes the fact that he killed a man
he was suffering from a neurological defect he couldnt control his behaviour
if iko had been diagnosed and treated he never would have committed that crime in a matter of speaking hes a victim of his own biology
so iko is the victim now
no ones denying that he committed a terrible crime but as a result of the doctors treatments hes undergone a fundamental change killing him wont accomplish anything
thats not your decision to make
nor is it yours
hes obviously deceiving you somehow
listen we could debate this all day but the fact is our personal opinions are irrelevant all that matters is nygean law
does iko have a legal means of appeal at his disposal
in accordance with nygean penal code a capital defendant has a right to appeal his sentence to the family of his victims
then id like you to help commander tuvok draft an appeal and submit it to the proper authorities
take back the appeal
youd rather die because you think itll relieve your pain
death is what i deserve you say ive changed but i look at these hands every day and i see them squeezing that mans throat and i hear the sounds he made im disgusting
do you think im disgusting
youve been nothing but kind to me
you asked me earlier if it hurt when my occipital implant was installed i told you i didnt remember but the truth is it was one of the most painful experiences of my life
why did you lie
its difficult for me to talk about because i forced others to undergo the same procedure
why
i was compelled to do so by the borg collective i wasnt in control of my actions just as you werent in control when you took a life my nanoprobes have given you control youre a different person now you dont deserve to be executed
i want to go back to my cell
youre free to remain here
am i still sick
no but
then i dont want special treatment
im glad to see youre feeling better you must be hungry here you go
give it to him
hes already had his dinner
please
all right
you wanted to see me
we just received a response from the nygeans the family has refused to consider the appeal
but the medical evidence
they wont look at it
the family found the request insulting
your government could insist that they review it
we have laws that protect victims from emotional distress
in that case we should grant iko asylum aboard voyager
you agreed to work within the confines of our legal system
your system is flawed
thats enough seven i assure you well abide by the familys decision now i need a moment alone with seven if you dont mind
we did everything we could to help him
we have to do more
you barely know this man why are you so passionate about helping him
i want to give him the same opportunity you gave me when you severed my link to the collective you changed who i was you made it possible for me to reclaim my humanity because of my nanoprobes iko has undergone a similar change he should be given the chance to atone for his crimes
atonement is that what this is about
yes
for him or for you
i dont know what you mean
i think part of you still feels responsible for the violent acts you committed when you were a borg
youre mistaken
am i maybe you believe if iko is found not guilty somehow you wont be guilty either you said it yourself youve reclaimed your humanity its time you stopped blaming yourself for the crimes of the collective
report
an alien vessel just dropped out of warp and opened fire
weve lost power on decks eight through ten
the cargo bay
follow me lets storm the bridge
shields down to sixty percent
still no response to hails
evasive manoeuvres target their weapons
tuvok to bridge the attacking ship is attempting to transport one of the prisoners
theyre trying to lock on to all five benkaran life signs
target their transporter array
direct hit theyre retreating
pursuit course
no we have more immediate problems bridge to tuvok whats your status
weve neutralised two of the prisoners
someones trying to get into the shuttlebay
lock them out
again
stand back
dont move
you have five minutes to get us a shuttle
tuvok to bridge lock on to yediqs signature and beam him to
transporters are offline we need at least ten minutes to get them up and running
seal it
youre not getting off this ship
then i suppose i should kill you right now
dont hes mine you saw how they beat me
i knew it was a trick i knew you hadnt changed
i wont beg for my life it belongs to you i only want you to understand whats happened to me im a different person now a better person this crew has helped me to see that if my death helps you find peace i can accept it but if you let me live i will never hurt anyone again whatever you decide please know how sorry i am for what i took from you
are we playing kadiskot later
sorry
afraid ill beat you again
i tried to help you and you took advantage of me
what do you mean
the note we sent your brother he traced the transmission to voyager hes the one who attacked us
neelix i swear i had no idea he would do that you have to believe me
i read yediqs security report you threatened to kill him
i cant eat this
why not
im sick
you look fine to me
no i must have the same condition iko had if your doctor cures me i can make an appeal for my life too
shes beautiful isnt she
onella the mother
and theres paedos still watching over her it was kind of captain janeway to let you bring me here
if your appeal is successful youll be able to go wherever you want
i hope youre right
if i am where will you go
i dont know
if youd like i could ask captain janeway to consider letting you stay here
im not a scientist i dont think id be much help to anyone
there are other ways to be useful im sure we could think of something
id like that
im sorry the family has denied your appeal
were due to rendezvous with a transport ship in a few hours i need to return you to your cell
you were the first person who wasnt afraid to look me in the eye thats how id like to remember you
i just finished looking over your warp core analysis
and
im impressed it usually takes a few days to finish one of these belanna tells me you did it in twenty two hours
i havent felt the need to regenerate
everyone grieves in their own way if you want to talk you know where to find me
its unfair
i think so too seven but we have to try not to judge their system
thats not what i meant iko was executed for taking a single life as a drone i took thousands but i was never punished
you lost twenty years of your life to the borg id say thats punishment enough
report
a ship just decloaked off our port stern
can you identify them
they recloaked
that disruptor blast had a klingon signature
evasive manoeuvres hail them
no response port shields are down to fifty percent
theyve recloaked again tetryon readings indicate its a dseven class cruiser
dseven they were retired decades ago
if their technology is antiquated
perhaps a metaphasic scan might be able to penetrate their cloak
do it
bridge to astrometrics
initiate a metaphasic sweep
ive detected a vessel transferring the trajectory to tactical
i have them
fire phasers
our cloak has failed
divert emergency power to shields
forward emitters are offline the federation ship is hailing again
answer them
captain
it may give us more time to get the cloak back on online visual
this is captain kathryn janeway of the federation starship voyager stand down
we will not surrender to sworn enemies
of the klingon empire
i think theres been a misunderstanding the empire signed a peace treaty with the federation more than eighty years ago if im not mistaken its still in effect
youre lying
im not lying but even if i were your ship is no match for mine i suggest we discuss this
what is there to talk about
the treaty for one thing ill give you access to our database show you im telling the truth
databases can be falsified
i have a klingon serving aboard this ship
impossible
shes my chief engineer
i will meet this chief engineer
wed be honoured to have you as our guest
youre safe here you have my word
forgive me if i dont find the word of a human very reassuring
id like to know what youre doing in the delta quadrant
im not answering any questions until i see the klingon
captain kohlar lieutenant torres our chief engineer
youre with child
thats what the doctor tells me
did you conceive during the holy month of naypoq
i have no idea
it would have been fourteen or fifteen weeks ago
that sounds about right not that its any of your business
i must return to my ship
arent you interested in learning about the treaty
heres a copy of the khitomer accords
i must return to my vessel
not without your assurance that you wont fire on my ship again
you have my word
escort captain kohlar back to the transporter room
aye captain
what the hell was that about
its the truth
how can you be certain
the scrolls say you will find me after two warring houses make peace our people and the federation our greatest enemy are at peace
so the humans claim these accords may be a deception
the other signs are present you will know me before i know the world
the child is unborn it does not know the world
you interpret the scrolls well
we must verify the evidence
your scepticism darkens my heart tgreth what evidence did our ancestors have when they began this journey nothing but their faith tell the others to prepare the day of separation has arrived
captain the klingon ship its core is breaching
red alert hail them
i salute you captain you did more damage to our vessel than my engineer thought
we can send over a team to help you establish a containment field
there isnt time
hes right their core is going to breach in less than thirty seconds
im requesting emergency transport
captain their crew complement is two hundred and four
erect forcefields around the shuttlebay transport them there tell your crew to stand by for evacuation
ten seconds
if were still too close when their core breaches
go to warp as soon as their crew is aboard
five four three
we have them
you spared us a dishonourable death
sensor logs indicate that the containment failure was not caused by our weapons
you activated a selfdestruct sequence
it was the only way to get us aboard voyager
why was that so important
its our sacred duty to be here
i dont understand
more than a hundred years ago my greatgrandfather was part of a sect which believed the empire had lost its way they discovered a sacred text it told them to embark on a journey to a distant region of the galaxy
youve been travelling for four generations
my people have always known the voyage would be long and difficult but the scrolls said we would be rewarded
how
we would find the kuvahmagh the saviour of our people the one who will lead us to a new empire the scrolls instruct us to follow her wherever she goes
what does any of this have to do with voyager
i believe the kuvahmagh is the unborn child of belanna torres
youre joking
they take their beliefs very seriously
seriously enough to destroy their own ship
couldnt they have just followed us
apparently their sacred text told them to cast off the old ways as soon as they found this kuvahmagh
they saw their vessel as the last vestige of the corrupt empire
i was hoping our daughter would be special but i never dreamed shed turn out to be the klingon messiah
this isnt funny they might be dangerous i mean what if they want to hurt the baby
to them your babys sacred its unlikely they would do anything to harm her
two hundred klingons pose a significant security threat i suggest we keep them confined to the shuttlebay until we can find a suitable home for them
there are women and children down there we cant just lock them up
i agree
captain
assign extra security to every deck and make sure the klingons know and abide by the rules
the bridge will have to be off limits engineering as well
keep them out of all restricted areas
despite their reverence for lieutenant torres she should be assigned a twenty four hour security detail
just what i need
where are they going to sleep
well double up in quarters ill ask for volunteers
i know this isnt going to be easy but until we can find another place for them we should do our best to make them feel comfortable dismissed
captain you must try the gagh
ill pass thank you but im glad to see youre getting into the spirit of things
well ive been studying the klingon database theyre a fascinating people very robust and they certainly seem to appreciate my culinary skills
looks like everythings running smoothly
ah not quite everything some of the starfleet people have been complaining about the smell personally i find it appealing a kind of a musky aroma
maybe we can adjust the environmental controls to filter out the musk
thief touch my food again and ill kill you
okay everybody relax
he took gagh from my plate
if you dont mind ensign ive been studying klingon etiquette you shouldnt quarrel over food save your strength for battle to fight those who would challenge you
take it easy
thats enough
you have a fiery spirit you will make a worthy mate
what a day i never met a more ravenous group in my life i must have served over three hundred meals
mister neelix may i ask what youre doing here
were bunkmates
there must be some mistake
no theres no mistake i gave up my quarters to a klingon family by the time i checked with commander chakotay you were the only one who hadnt been paired up
you should have consulted me
were such close friends i knew you wouldnt mind
mister neelix as much as i enjoy your company i prefer solitude in my own quarters
you dont really want me to go back there and tell that family to get out do you good because i promise you were going to have fun mister vulcan i learned some klingon drinking songs ill teach them to you  ej humtah ej dechtah iwej doq sodtah ghospa sqral biqtiq
paris to torres
im almost finished
you said that an hour ago
ill be there in a minute i promise torres out keep an eye on the replicators theyve already gone down once today
its her
when you said be there in a minute you werent kidding
a group of klingons ambushed me outside of engineering i decided transporting myself would be easier than running the gauntlet im starting to feel like a prisoner
well at least you have a handsome cellmate
how long do you think theyre going to be on board
i thought youd be glad to have other klingons around youve always told me how uncomfortable it is being the only one
i guess i should be careful what i wish for
maybe you should talk to some of them give them a chance
come in
captain
im sorry to bother you but i need your help ten of the klingons have started a hunger strike they say they wont eat until you agree to meet with their council of elders
thats ridiculous
their faith is obviously very important to them
they think im something im not
just talk to them hear what they have to say
we could be with these people for a while you cant avoid them forever
i can try
if itll make you feel any better ill go with you
mobar dohlomaj kuvahmagh mobar dohlomaj kuvahmagh mobar dohlomaj kuvahmagh mobar dohlomaj kuvahmagh mobar dohlomaj kuvahmagh mobar dohlomaj kuvahmagh mobar dohlomaj kuvahmagh
you honour us with your presence
look at her ridges morak was right your blood is not pure
no my father was human
couldnt you see this for yourself
yes but
why didnt you tell us
it wasnt important
not important we destroyed our ship because you said she was the mother of the kuvahmagh
show me where its written that the kuvahmagh must have pure klingon blood
the prophecy wouldnt lead us to a mongrel child
hey take it easy
who are you
the father of that mongrel child
more human blood your kuvahmagh isnt even halfklingon
ive spent my life interpreting the scrolls and i say that all the signs of the prophecy are here
liar youve led us to a false saviour
i told you this was a mistake
lieutenant i need your help
any more help from me and youre going to have a holy war on your hands
thats what im trying to prevent
my babys just a baby shes not a saviour
perhaps youre right but we must convince my people that she is
why
weve travelled more than thirty thousand light years in search of this saviour and in more than one hundred years weve found nothing except hardship and isolation when i saw lieutenant torres that she was with child i didnt know if i was looking at the mother of the kuvahmagh or not but i did know i was looking at an opportunity to end this wasteful journey
then you dont believe in the prophecy
what i believe is that my people have suffered enough if they accept your child as the kuvahmagh youll hold great influence over them we can find a suitable planet you can tell them its their new home and theyll follow you there
im not going to lie to them
whats the alternative my people staying aboard your ship draining your resources
i agree with lieutenant torres im not comfortable deceiving your people
perhaps you wont have to lie to them to convince them
what are you suggesting
if you study the scrolls with me we may be able to interpret them in way that appears consistent with the events of your life then well bring those consistencies to the attention of the council
so you just want to stretch the truth a little
it is possible that the sacred scrolls were scrawled by a madman in a cave or perhaps they really were divinely inspired either way theyve guided us for over a century if my people start to believe that the sacred scrolls have led them astray there may be violence
is that a threat
merely a fact youre doing everything you can to get your people home captain thats all im doing for mine
it says the kuvahmagh will be descended from a noble house i dont come from one and im pretty sure my husband doesnt either
we all have nobility in our blood if we go back far enough
so these scrolls can mean anything you want them to
it is written that the mother of the kuvahmagh would be an offworlder werent you born on a federation colony
a lot of klingons are born offworld
it also says that you would have lived a life of solitude and endured many hardships thats accurate isnt it
according to this im supposed to have won a glorious victory against an army of ten thousand warriors
havent you
we havent even encountered ten thousand warriors unless you include the borg
did you help destroy one of their vessels
i suppose
couldnt that have been your glorious victory
i guess so
where are the images of kahless where is your family crest
they clashed with the carpet
dont you honour any of your peoples traditions
not really
there is one tradition we can honour together
what are you doing
its midday time to remember the sacrifice of our ancestors havent you made a plea for the dead before
not since i was a child
the dead cant rest in stovokor if the living dont honour their memory perhaps theres someone i can honour on your behalf who did you plead for as a child
my grandmother
she was called
lnaan
kahless we implore you to remember those warriors who have fallen in your name lift them out of the cavern of despair and reveal yourself to them in all your glory
right in all your glory
remember kolax son of amar remember talij daughter of krene
remember lnaan daughter of krelik
what happened to you
i cut myself shaving
is that a bite mark
one of the klingons attacked me
did you do something to provoke him
not him her and she wasnt provoked she was aroused
ah im not surprised ive studied the section on klingon mating rituals in their cultural database
then maybe you can tell me how to convince a female twice my size that im not interested
hmm you probably cant
great
as i understand it you have two options kill her or mate with her since the first option is clearly unacceptable
whats this
authorisation for you to engage in intimate relations with a member of an alien species be sure to get the captains approval as well
thats when they beamed aboard the flyer weapons firing tuvok and neelix fought valiantly but there were too many hirogen i had to face ten of their fiercest hunters alone
is that how you remember it
took them down two at a time but they kept coming
exaggeration is part of klingon custom shes doing great
i had my phaser shot out of my hand forcing me to take down the last hunter in handtohand combat it was a glorious fight
your ancestors would be honoured
you tell a good story but thats not why youre here some say you are the mother of the kuvahmagh the one who will guide us to a new homeworld has your unborn child told you where it is
the scrolls say you will follow in my footsteps before i have made them yesterday we changed course toward a planet very much like kronos so in a manner of speaking you are now following my child to a new home
you deliver the words we want to hear but its kohlar who gives them to you are you his puppet in the bedchamber as well
watch it thats my wife youre talking about
he speaks i didnt think you had a tongue
leave him out of this
you see how he hides behind his female it is also written that the father of the kuvahmagh will be an honourable warrior would an honourable warrior ever refuse a challenge
i havent refused any challenge
i havent made one yet you and i
to the death
tom
stay out of this
petaq
i accept
what was i supposed to say
how about no
they were all watching there would have been a riot if i refused
so youre going to get yourself killed 
what makes you so sure id lose
oh please
look i have no intention of fighting anyone to the death but wasnt the whole point of this to get them to believe that we are the parents of their saviour
captain this has gone too far youve got to put a stop to it
i intend tomister tuvok
gentlemen im afraid lieutenant paris had no authority to accept this challenge there will be no death matches aboard my ship
i told you this petaq was not the true father
lieutenant paris is perfectly willing to fight you mister tgreth im the one preventing him from doing so
the father of the kuvahmagh wouldnt let a woman speak for him
tgreth there is precedent for an honourable compromise a nonlethal bout fought with blunted batleths the victory goes to the first warrior to knock his opponent to the ground three times
a cowards rules
was the emperor mureq a coward he was the one who instituted these rules to insure that his warriors would kill their enemies and not each other
if you agree to these terms ill allow the match
ill see you on the field of battle
i assume you have a suitable holodeck training programme for this lieutenant
hell be ready ill train him myself
hi
psst neelix
something wrong harry
shush have you seen her
who
that klingon woman the one i got into a scrape with in the mess hall
officer chrega
thats her
i havent seen her today
shes been following me everywhere
why
she wants to mate
oh youre a lucky man shes a fine specimen of klingon womanhood
i guess its a matter of taste
you never saw me
wait i have a better idea
neelix what the hell are you doing
play along im taking her off your hands when i say youre limited to two servings of brakt thats all you get do you understand me ensign
yes sir whatever you say
i dont think you do if i catch you eating more than your share again ill cut it out of your belly  run
excuse me
petaq
i didnt think you approved of the competition
i dont im here in an official capacity
well you do know theyre fighting with nonlethal weapons
youd be surprised how much damage a blunt batleth can do
warriors assemble
today would be a very bad day to die
ill try to remember that
let honour guide you tagh
i see fear in your eyes human
the only klingon im afraid of is my wife after shes worked a double shift
its begun
what are you talking about
hes dying
typically im the one to make that kind of prognosis
its the nehret it kills all of us who arent fortunate enough to die in battle
its a retrovirus that destroys the cells by attacking the cytoplasmic membranes
shouldnt our biofilters have detected it when we transported the klingons aboard
this is an insidious virus it lies dormant disguising itself as inert genetic material until it inexplicably activates
the nehret always comes without warning
ive reviewed my scans of the other klingons theyre all carriers
why didnt you tell us your people had a disease
weve never thought of it as a disease its more like old age
is it contagious
only to klingons if youd give us some privacy id like to examine lieutenant torres
of course
the baby too
im afraid so
why am i here
youre ill you collapsed during the fight
the nehret
yes thank you for telling us now my baby and i have it too
where do you think youre going
to prepare for my journey to stovokor
you should be in sickbay
can you make me well
not at the moment but
then dont deny me my tradition
the child is not the kuvahmagh
but the father accepted your challenge he defeated you
i was defeated by the nehret belanna torres and her child will fall victim to it as well
impossible
they both carry it she told me herself
but the scrolls say the kuvahmagh is younger than old age
and stronger than sickness she cannot be our saviour we should resume our search
kohlar and many of the others wont agree
then we must act alone for the good of our people
how
well wait for the right moment and when it comes well seize voyager
weve identified two potential colony sites in the southern hemisphere
well require topographical scans
ill prepare them
i shouldnt have doubted you it appears the signs were there all along ill join the survey mission
youre ill old friend you should remain here
i want my final days to be spent in honourable pursuits dont ask me to die inside these walls
we transport in one hour
your transporters are much more sophisticated than ours
ive studied klingon transport systems the basic technology isnt all that different
but you were able to beam our entire crew aboard voyager at one time
we usually dont like to do that for safety reasons but in a pinch we can expand the buffer capacity
these are the targeting scanners
exactly they work on the same principles as yours
you said it was urgent
i need to conduct a more detailed bioscan of your baby
shes not sick is she
no but i may be on to something
ill be leading the team going to site a kohlar will be in charge of the site b team
good morning commander
harry
phaser fire in transporter room one
bridge to chakotay
theyre on the surface
now lock on to the bridge officers
theyve activated a forcefield around deck one
transport the rest of their crew
captain im detecting multiple transports some of our people are being beamed down to the surface
cut power to the transporters
i cant
bridge to engineering belanna respond
theres no one in engineering
the bridge officers
i still cant get a lock
can you transport us there
ill try
computer open the transporter room doors security override tuvok pi alpha
grant me a warriors death i beg of you
sorry no mercy killings on my bridge get our people back
yes maam
why am i not in stovokor
because you are healthy as a targ
the nehret
gone
we have belanna torress child to thank for it
the foetus has hybrid stem cells they contain klingon and human dna i used them to synthesise an antivirus
the child cured me
well i was the one who devised the treatment
doctor
yes of course the child cured you
the kuvahmagh has healed all of us she truly is our saviour
computer open this door
access to these quarters has been restricted
on whose authority
neelix
mister neelix open this door
ill be there in a minute commander thats thats my boot
computer security override authorisation tuvok pi
goodbye my little parmachkai
goodbye my fearless warrior
im really going to miss her
oh dont you worry mister vulcan ill have this place shipshape in no time at all
just go mister neelix
whats this
the batleth given to me by my greatgrandfather its for your daughter i hope someday youll tell her about us
i will
qapla belanna torres
qapla
it doesnt seem right just to hang it on the wall
im not letting you scratch it up on the holodeck
im sure our daughter wouldnt mind lending it to the old man every now and then you know this is one special kid were going to have
youre just figuring that out
i was hoping for an artist or maybe a musician but shes already the saviour of an entire race
you dont really believe that
i dont know there are a lot of coincidences to explain i mean what were the odds that theyd run into the one ship in the whole quadrant with a klingon aboard
probably about the same odds that you and i would get married
maybe we should name her kuvahmagh just to be safe
put it on the list
for our third course luhvian quail in truffle sauce served with roasted chadre kab
my compliments to the chef
hear hear
thank you captain
cream of leola soup fettran risotto luhvian quail it just keeps getting better
i knew youd been expanding your palate but i didnt realise youd become a gourmet cook
preparing meals myself is the best way to ensure quality
i suppose i should be insulted but everything is so delicious i may just have to admit defeat and hang up my apron
no thatd be a real tragedy neelix
pinot noir commander
ill have another glass of the chardonnay
each course has been paired with a specific wine substitutions are not recommended
the pinot noir sounds perfect
is there any salt
additional seasoning is not required
im sorry i just
if the quail hasnt been prepared to your satisfaction i could replicate something more to your liking a peanut butter and jelly sandwich perhaps
actually its delicious just the way it is
captain to the bridge report
were being
pulled off course
how
im not certain it appears to be some kind of graviton surge
on my way
weve rerouted all available power to the thrusters but we cant break free
try reversing the shield polarity
no effect
what happened to the stars
shields at sixty five percent
hail them
theyre not responding
return fire can you identify them
their weapon signature is vaadwaur but the ship has technology from several different species
theres another vessel approaching its charging weapons
evasive pattern beta six
maybe weve got an ally
the vaadwaur ship is retreating
hail the second ship
no response
i stand corrected
theyve penetrated our aft shields
reroute power to the auxiliary emitters and return fire
theyve transported material off decks five seven and eight
disable their engines
follow them
navigational sensors are malfunctioning its something to do with this environment
i want a full damage report and an inventory of everything that was taken off this ship and i want to know where we are
they got more than ninety percent of our food stores including almost everything in the airponics bay they also got a computer console from engineering and they emptied three of our deuterium tanks
why would anyone steal deuterium you can find it anywhere
apparently not here im not detecting any gases stellar bodies or matter of any kind
except for the ships that attacked us scan for other vessels i want to know how many were dealing with
there are more than one hundred fifty ships within scanning range but im only detecting lifesigns on twenty nine of them
captain theres another vessel approaching at high impulse
quite a welcoming committee theyve got here
whats the status of our shields
theyre at twenty eight percent
thatll have to do charge weapons
captain this one wants to talk
on screen im captain janeway of the starship voyager
general valen welcome to the void
youre the first ship weve seen here that hasnt tried to fire on us but in case you change your mind were prepared to defend ourselves
i know ive been observing you on sensors the way you fought those ships was impressive most vessels dont survive the first few minutes
id appreciate any information you could give us about where we are
the anomalys a closed structure encased by an inert layer of subspace matter and energy cant penetrate it
our ships certainly penetrated it when we were pulled in
by the funnels but they only pull matter in one direction into the void
have you explored the entire anomaly
theres nothing to explore but its big weve calculated the outer circumference at approximately nine light years but weve never been able to breech it
how long have you been here
more than five years
there must be a way to escape
new arrivals are always thinking about escape
we have a sophisticated starship maybe if we work together we can find a way out
youre being naive no one ever gets out
we may be able to devise a new approach
many have tried all they did was waste resources that could have kept them alive longer dont be foolish i can help you
how
the only source of food and energy in the void comes from new ships that are drawn in if you want to survive here youll have to compete for their resources
and i suppose you can help us do that
i have tactical data on some of the more dangerous predators
but you want something in return
my scans show you have photon torpedoes
im sorry we dont trade weapons
why not
because we have no way of knowing what theyll be used for plundering innocent ships for example
wait a few weeks until your resources start to run out morality wont keep your life support systems running
im sorry general there are some compromises i wont make
not yet
report lieutenant
were using power at almost ten times the usual rate
while were standing still
the same graviton forces that pulled us into the anomaly seem to be draining the warp core at this rate our deuterium will be gone in about ten days
shut down all nonessential systems
where are you going
to find a way out of here
using fractal algorithms with the borg sensors i believe i can predict where and when these funnels will occur
well thats impressive but how does it help us
the funnels originate inside the anomaly creating massive graviton forces before they erupt if we were to enter one of the funnels just as that happened we might be able to use those forces to propel us into normal space
not without compromising structural integrity
i might be able to reinforce the shields to compensate
theres another problem when the graviton forces reach critical levels the polarity suddenly reverses pulling everything near the funnel back into the anomaly
wed have to jump to warp at exactly the right moment
wed need to achieve a velocity of warp eight point two
question is will we have enough power
at the rate were losing it we may only get one shot at this the sooner we try the better
theres a funnel forming seventy thousand metres off the port bow bearing one three zero mark two four
graviton surge in thirty four seconds
full power to shields and structural integrity take us in mister paris
five seconds four three
structural integrity at twenty percent ten percent
fifty thousand kilometres to normal space
prepare to go to warp
engineering to the bridge
go ahead
the warp core is offline
if nothing else we learned some things thatll help us next time
with all due respect captain we dont even have warp drive anymore
i may be able to get it back online but we still need deuterium to get our basic systems running
how long will our reserves last
if we shut down life support on all but a few decks deactivate astrometrics turbolifts ration replicator use maybe a week
i used to make a living scavenging for supplies let me take one of the shuttles i might be able to find deuterium on one of those abandoned ships
the shuttle would be too easy a target
i appreciate the offer neelix but were safer if we stay together
the shuttles may be useful in another capacity
we could use their warp cores to augment power on voyager
were still going to need more deuterium
lets track down the ship that raided us and get back what they stole
we should do it quickly ive detected a number of vessels monitoring us
the vultures are circling
vultures eat the dead mister paris were not dead yet
the vessels in visual range
shields on screen
looks like somebody got to them before we did
no lifesigns
scan for ion trails whoever did this probably has our deuterium
aye captain
is there anything left aboard that ship worth salvaging
their technology and supplies have been picked clean
not everything of value has been taken the warp core has been removed but the casing that protected it is intact its composed of tricesium
we can convert it into a power source
every little bit helps lock onto the core casing and beam it to the cargo bay
with the additional power we could reactivate the astrometrics lab
i can think of some better uses
for example
oh i dont know making sure theres air to breathe this must be where they cut through the casing to remove the core
crude but effective
somethings in there
identify yourself
torres to security intruder alert
acknowledged
there
stay where you are
he appears to be injured
how is he
his injury doesnt seem serious but he wont let me close enough to treat him
my names captain janeway youre safe here
ive tried communicating with him he doesnt appear to have any verbal skills
do we know how he got on board
i believe he was transported along with the core casing
we should have picked up his lifesigns
were trying to determine why we didnt detect him
that vessel he was on had no atmosphere how did he survive
my scans show he can conserve oxygen he has unusually large lung capacity and a voracious appetite
do you think that ship was his home
maybe but we cant send him back he cant survive without oxygen indefinitely
well run scans for other members of his species but until we can find a safe place for him lets make him as comfortable as possible
computer replicate a portion of nutritional supplements from my daily allotment
you found something
we think we know who has our deuterium
its someone weve already met
i knew id see you again captain i expect youve reconsidered my proposal
were not here to trade were here to take back what belongs to us
i dont know what you mean
our scans indicate youve got some of our food one of our consoles and a large quantity of our deuterium
we didnt take any of that from you
no apparently you killed the crew of another ship and took it from them we want it back
thats not the way things work here
either you give it back or well take it
hes powering his engines
target his shields and fire lock onto whatever belongs to us and transport it to the cargo bay
im detecting large quantities of food on his supply deck
maybe we should take it while we have the chance
is it ours
no but our own reserves are running out
valen wouldnt hesitate to take it from us
no he wouldnt weve got whats ours reverse course
come in
an updated inventory of our supplies we got back less than half of what was stolen
doesnt take two of you to deliver a padd whats on your mind
we want to be clear about what our policys going to be while were here in the void
you think we should have taken valens food
logic suggests we may have to be more opportunistic if we intend to survive
we may not like valens tactics but he and his crew are still alive after five years in here
i was thinking about that myself i thought maybe i could get some guidance from the federation charter i was hoping id find a loophole that would allow us to take actions we ordinarily wouldnt take
any luck
the charters a statement of principles not a practical document
no section on how to exist in a void
no but ive become convinced that weve got to stick to our principles not abandon them
should the crew be ready to die for those principles
if the alternative means becoming thieves and killers ourselves yes but im betting that our principles are going to keep us alive
captain
the federation is based on mutual cooperation the idea that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts voyager cant survive here alone but if we form a temporary alliance with other ships maybe we can pool our resources and escape
as youve pointed out the people weve encountered in this void are thieves and killers such individuals are hardly ideal allies
i agree
then who are we going to form an alliance with
anyone who agrees to play by our rules no killing no stealing and no giving up
forgive me captain but why would anyone who has survived by killing and stealing suddenly agree to those terms
well offer to share our food and medical supplies and defend ships that are attacked by raiders
captain maybe youd better take another look at that inventory our food and power reserves will be gone within a week if we start giving everything away
maybe well only survive for two days instead of seven on the other hand if we share what we have instead of hoarding it we might find other people willing to do the same if we combine our technology we can find ways of improving our situation and ultimately get the hell out of this place we may lose a little weight gentlemen but we wont lose who we are
whenever a new ship gets pulled into the void theyre immediately attacked instead of attacking it youd have to help defend the new ship
and how is that in my interest
it would encourage them to join our alliance
and if they refuse then we raid them
everyone in the alliance must agree not to launch unprovoked attacks
then how are we supposed to get supplies
the idea is to recruit new members share technology and resources
we almost escaped the void on our own if we work together i believe well succeed
how many ships do you have in this alliance
youd be the first
technically captain thats not correct i consider myself the first member of the captains coalition six years ago i offered her my services and the resources of my ship and shes never failed to help me when i needed her
its a noble idea captain but good intentions are like deuterium reserves they tend to get lost in the void
all i ask is that you consider our proposal
i will
in the meantime wed like to offer you food and medical supplies
what do you expect in return
nothing compliments of the alliance
i tried
captain theres been a theft
whats missing
my phase compensator no doubt it was stolen by one of your prospective members
it wasnt stolen i gave it to the nygeans they needed it to repair their sensor array
i presume you obtained something equally valuable in return
i think i did the goodwill of a potential ally
did they join
not yet
captain
i know its not exactly the most efficient policy but then you dont always do whats most efficient either
i dont know what youre implying
you gave up your rations to our guest in sickbay
he needed food
youre a valuable member of this crew your friend in sickbay is nothing but a drain on resources whats efficient about wasting food on him you think im being inefficient tuvok thinks im being illogical you both could be right but maybe the best way to get help is to give it oh and seven
yes
im sorry i gave away your favourite phase compensator
how is he
much better he seemed to relax when he heard me humming an aria from rigoletto so i had the computer play the full orchestral version fantome seems to be a music lover
fantome
after the phantom of the opera a tormented character who was soothed by music
in six years you havent chosen a name for yourself but youve given fantome one in a few days
choosing the right name for myself is extremely difficult im a complex individual
and fantome isnt
on the contrary i believe hes quite intelligent and his physiology is very sophisticated did you know he has the ability to refract his own lifesigns
that would explain why our sensors didnt detect him
i wish we could find a way to communicate with him i suspect hed have a lot to tell us
we were enjoying that
exactly he may not be able to speak but he can hear
he understands
so it would seem
whats the occasion
sevens not the only one who knows how to set an elegant table
you have heard there is a food shortage
thats no reason why you two cant enjoy a romantic dinner unfortunately i cant light this it would be a waste of oxygen still it is festive
we appreciate the effort
i believe theres been a mistake here waiter i didnt order this
close your eyes and pretend that its sevens fettran risotto
it tastes more like chicken
whats this
a preserved olian guava i had a few left
neelix
no arguments youre eating for two
senior officers report to stations immediately
sorry neelix
charge weapons shields to full
whats going on
a funnel just opened it pulled in a new vessel
two warships are approaching it one of them is valens
target valens weapons and hail him
my fights not with you captain
then stand down
this new ship has impressive technology we can share it
im not here to divide the spoils
then why are you here
to protect the ship youre firing on
what are they to you
just some people in a bad situation like the rest of us
save your speeches ive got a crew to feed
hes targeting our shields
take his weapons out hail the new ship
i surrender
were here to help you can you target the smaller warship
were a survey vessel were not equipped to fight
shields at sixty percent
fire torpedoes
shields on valens lead ship are holding at eighty percent it appears hes upgraded them since we last met
ours
thirty
the smaller ship is outmanoeuvring us
we have hull breeches on decks five and six
seal them
shields at fifteen percent
engineering to the bridge
go ahead
were losing containment at this rate well be dead in the water in less than three minutes
we should retreat captain
not yet
you might want to reconsider theres another ship approaching
we cant defend ourselves against three ships
we may not have to the third vessel belongs to mister garon hes firing at the other two valens shields are down the smaller ship is leaking plasma
theyre both retreating
garons hailing
get a weapons lock on him weve been fooled by unexpected allies before
why are you targeting me
because i dont know what your intentions are
havent i just made them clear ive decided to accept your offer
well in that case welcome to the alliance
neelix we have another guest for dinner
always room for one more captain
who did you raid to get fresh vegetables
theyre replicated one of the crews that joined us had technology that tripled our replicator efficiency
it may not be a gourmet feast but we can feed five hundred people a day now using half the power it took us a few days ago
why dont we sit down
doctor
hello commander
hows your patient
technically hes not a patient anymore but its taken me this long to coax him out of sickbay hes quite shy
im telling him not to worry that youre the one who keeps us all safe
he says thank you
an ingenious method of communication
it began with a few simple words but now were capable of rudimentary conversation
tell him im pleased hes feeling better
i will
whats that parasite doing aboard your ship
i beg your pardon
theyre vermin
i dont know who you are sir but your choice of words is offensive
what is offensive is the way they slip aboard during transport hide in conduits steal food spread disease
fantome is perfectly healthy and unlike some people in this void he hasnt stolen anything
if my sensors could detect where they are on my ship id exterminate them i suggest you do the same
captain this is outrageous
doctor one of the principles of our alliance is that we dont discriminate everyones welcome as long as they follow the rules but if youre having a bad experience with the members of this species on your ship id be happy to bring them to voyager
if you could find them
now that weve had a chance to analyse fantomes physiology i think we can get a transporter lock on them
is this your way of enticing me to join your alliance
im simply trying to demonstrate how cooperation and tolerance can benefit everyone
then we have an agreement
okay now connect the primary emitter relay
online
hows it coming
pretty well we just need to
i guess i was being a little optimistic
whats the problem exactly
we think we can establish a shield bubble large enough to encompass all our ships but we have no way to compensate for the graviton stress
wouldnt a polaron modulator be able to do that
unfortunately nobody in the alliance has one weve been trying to build our own but so far
maybe we could trade for one or find
a new ally who has one
its not a common piece of technology and its valuable it may be difficult to convince anyone to part with it
you never know unless you ask
you are not authorised to be in here
were making a valuable contribution to the alliance
by spying on restricted meetings
weve devised a new surveillance technique
ask harry to give you a hand
youve bypassed my security measures
we can observe activity on any ship in the void without being detected this is the cargo hold of the jelinian freighter now if im not mistaken the jelinians are a member of our alliance
which is why you shouldnt be spying on them
and why they shouldnt be hoarding their ale
lovely piece did they compose it or did you
they did though strictly speaking its not a composition its more of a conversation
im impressed
i wish i could take credit but it was fantome who taught the others in a fraction of the time it took him to learn theyre a highly intelligent species
the language is already developing its own grammar and syntax
that suggests they have a language of their own
mmm hmm it could be telepathic but they seem just as comfortable communicating with music now
could their species be native to the void
its certainly possible they told us they were born here
just when you think nothing in the galaxy can surprise you anymore
captain janeway please report to engineering
just what we needed captain a fully compatible polaron modulator
where did you get it
the kinjal frigate
do they want to join ouralliance
theyre not interested
how did you get this
i traded for it
what did you give them
i dont answer to you
did you steal it disconnect the modulator
captain
were returning it to the people it belongs to
they have no more use for it
you dont know that
you killed them
captain i dont like his tactics any more than you do but why waste this technology when were so close to escaping
because its a violation of everything this alliance stands for
refusing the modulator wont bring back the people he killed
no but using it would make us accessories to murder take it and get out
the jelinians and the kraylor have left with bosaal they felt you were being
impulsive and selfrighteous is that what you think
you did what you had to do
still i made a mistake
by telling bosaal to leave
you couldnt have known what he was going to do
oh i had a pretty good idea what kind of person he was that bigoted reaction he had to the doctors friend told me all i needed to know but i ignored my instincts
why
because i thought his ship could help us escape
you werent the only one who wanted him in the alliance
maybe not but if id listened to my doubts in the first place we wouldnt have lost the other two ships
well find a way out of here without them
where do we stand with the modulator
belanna and the other engineers are working around the clock to build one she thinks theyll be ready to test in a couple of days
so everyones pulling together to make up for my mistake
they have to it says so in the federation charter
good news i hope
im afraid not it appears commander bosaal is attempting to form an alliance of his own with one of our adversaries
we recorded a tactical conversation that took place between them just a few minutes ago
dont underestimate janeway ive been in battle with her twice
then you know janeways tactics i have two other ships we can take voyagers food and weapons if we work together
the rest of their conversation suggests they will attack within the next forty eight hours
im so glad we taught them the value of cooperation
our power reserves will be severely depleted if were forced to defend ourselves
tell belanna we dont have time to test her modulator weve got to try to escape now
sorry to interrupt but weve got a situation developing were going to try to break free of the anomaly your friends are welcome to join us but they should be aware of the dangers
the voids their home they want to stay
where would they like us to transport them
theyre nomads any shipll do they said theyre grateful for our help they want to help us now
theres a funnel forming in grid four graviton surge in ninety eight seconds
alert the other ships take us in tom
aye captain
bosaal and his fleet are approaching they are charging weapons
janeway to engineering status
i need two more minutes
youve got one
surge in fifty seconds
voyager to all alliance ships begin firing at your designated targets
weve penetrated shields on both vessels
janeway to the doctor initiate
transport
acknowledged yes goodbye and good luck energise
transport complete captain theyre in the engine rooms of both ships
acknowledged
thirty seconds
janeway to engineering we need that modulator
just a few more seconds
were receiving a hail from valens ship audio only
lets hear it
whats he saying doctor
mission accomplished fantomes shut down power on valens ship
confirmed bosaals ship has lost power as well
who says gremlins in the engine are a myth
surge in five seconds four
now belanna
all ships are in formation
structural integrity at thirty percent
forty thousand metres to normal space
twenty percent ten percent
do it tom
gentlemen its been a privilege to have you as allies
i never believed wed escape
then why did you join
captain janeway is very persuasive and the food was good
youre welcome to have a meal with us anytime
ah unfortunately were headed in the opposite direction safe journey to you and your crew captain
and to all of yours as well
thank you
it was almost like being part of a federation again
the real ones only thirty thousand light years away
then what are we standing around for
excuse me can you tell me where i can find the supervisor
over there
thank you
your authorisation and licenses please level six in thermal dynamics and quantum fusion well janeway im impressed
thank you sir
now if you can just manage to report to your shift on time
im sorry i boarded the wrong transport i ended up at the atmosphere filtration facility
theyre always looking for skilled workers im surprised they didnt offer you a job
i promise i wont be late again
well its easy to get disoriented when youre new here ive been in this city all my life and i still get lost on occasion now youll be monitoring the primary reactor coils they process more than eight thousand
eight thousand metric tons of tylium per second at ninety four percent thermal efficiency i memorised the specifications
let me know if theres anything you need youll find we like to keep our workforce happy
i can already tell its going to be much better than my last job
the specifications you asked for
thanks
input error four one five command code violation two three zero eight
come on shut off that damn alarm and i promise ill never violate you again
you almost started a core overload
i would have corrected it
well im sorry for interrupting then and for eavesdropping i overheard you talking to your console
its an old habit
does it work
im not sure this control panel and i speak the same language yet
well if you need an interpreter jaffen
kathryn
i work just down there
thats good to know
this station doesnt require two operators
i dont think weve met im
employee one three two six and youre employee eight five eight four since youre new here you may not be fully familiar with the labour protocols but you should be aware that fraternising is not permitted during work hours
and do you have a number or maybe a name
annika hansen
and what exactly is your position here
im the new efficiency monitor
oh i didnt know theyd hired one
now that you do i suggest you return to your station
we werent fraternising he was just helping me correct an input error were almost finished
do it quickly
yes maam
i thought we were fraternising maybe we could get acquainted after work there is a little place some of us like to go to we could get a meal
i cant
you need to talk to someone besides your console
i appreciate the offer but with this new job i dont really have time to socialise
theyre always looking for labourers at the power distribution plant
i had a job there once didnt like it much
odd they treat their employees well how long were you there
oh a while
it would be very simple for me to find out
a day
a day
half a day actually give or take an hour
not what id call an illustrious career
i dont belong behind a console pushing buttons but when i heard some of the workers talking about your place i knew i had to get a job here
you were terminated werent you
yes
thats quite an accomplishment during a labour shortage what happened
its a long story
i like a long story
i had a disagreement with the new efficiency monitor she didnt think my work was very
efficient
exactly
then why should i hire you
well theres my natural charm and personality theyd be a real asset around a place like this where youre trying to attract patrons i mean look at you you havent been able to tear yourself away from me
theres no one else here
please i really need the work
youd better clean those tables over there this place is going to be filled with hungry workers as soon as the next shift ends
you wont regret this
oh im certain i will
all of them about my father and he couldnt understand why i wasnt insulted finally i just had to tell him im norvalen i dont have a father
it wasnt that funny tuvok
on the contrary the man was ignorant of how your species procreates his attempt to disparage you ultimately humiliated him irony is often a source of humour
yes well when you explain it like that its not funny at all
i also have some humorous anecdotes to share
ill look forward to hearing them
i thought you didnt have time to socialise
im not socialising im reviewing these manuals and having something to eat
well i recommend the latara broth and the section on thermal coefficients ill join you
really im very very busy
oh not to socialise to er help you review the manuals
here you are compliments of the proprietress
tom
ill be right back
the proprietress doesnt give away drinks
well im just creating customer loyalty
youve been creating loyalty all night with those two women i suggest you attend to the other tables
yes maam
here you are
thank you it looks great
i cant believe i let you keep me out this late
i felt it was my responsibility to help you study those manuals
of course
and now that i have you should be less likely to overload the core you know with all this fascinating discussion about thermal coefficients you never told me where youre from
a planet called earth
never heard of it
oh a long way from here
whats it like
overpopulated polluted very little work
it sounds like my home world i guess were both lucky to be here
its nice to be in a place where different species get along so well
so you admit were getting along
i was speaking in a broader cultural context
i see
theres a lot of violence where i come from
thats too bad
i still havent adjusted to the weather here it gets so cold at night
its almost curfew
yes sir we both live right here
good night then
you know one of the advantages of living in employee housing is that we can continue sharing ideas even after the work day is over
is that so
yes and i do have a spectacular view of the river from my living quarters
i really have to get to sleep maybe another time
im sorry if im making you uncomfortable
youre not
well if you get lonely
ill let you know
it wasnt me
its not an overload its time for our inoculations
what inoculations
theyre nothing to worry about protection against ambient radiation
i didnt realise that was a problem
its not as long as youre inoculated regularly were lucky to have an employer that concerned about our safety
is something wrong
forgive me but im im afraid of injections
i assure you this is painless
is there some other method of administering the medication
no im afraid there isnt
very well
were finished you can go back to work next
in six years ive never been on an away mission worse than this one
i dont know how you can say that the cargo hold is crammed with valuable supplies
and my stomach is crammed with alien parasites doing backflips
i guess you shouldnt have drunk that falah nectar
you insisted i try it
the nar shaddan consider it a delicacy to refuse would have insulted them
i didnt hear you insisting that commander chakotay try it
commander chakotays a vegetarian
it was made from meat
more like a meat byproduct
im going to be sick
not after you drink this
what is it
leola bark tea to settle even the queasiest of stomachs
oh it smells worse than the meat nectar ill wait for the doctor to treat me at least ill be sleeping in my own bed tonight
harry i know youre not feeling well but i need you and neelix up here
on our way
anything wrong commander
were at the rendezvous coordinates but theres no sign of voyager and theyre not responding to hails start scanning on all frequencies theyve got to be out there somewhere
so much for my own bed
reinitialise the subspace transponder
warning main computer is failing
switch to backup processors
main computer stabilised
good now lets try this again reinitialise the subspace transponder
unable to comply
why not
insufficient power
and they say im difficult reroute power from the replicator system
unable to comply
clarify
relays to the transponder are fused
any suggestions
please restate inquiry
can the power relays be bypassed
negative
then i suppose ill have to replace them by hand
warning intruder alert
where
the bridge
how many
two humanoids
can you identify them
negative sensor resolution is below twenty percent
stop what youre doing and turn around
take it easy doc its us
its good to see some friendly faces for that matter its good to see any faces at all im sorry i havent gotten life support back online yet but since ive been the only one aboard it hasnt been a priority
what the hell happened
we ran into some problems
i can see that can you be a little more specific
of course about twelve hours after you left on your away mission things started to go wrong
we hit some sort of subspace mine
computer transfer the emh to the mobile emitter sickbay to bridge sickbay to engineering please respond
it wasnt long before i was inundated with casualties all suffering from tetryon radiation poisoning pretty soon the captain arrived
doctor can you treat these people
i can stabilise them but if we cant contain the radiation
get everyone to the escape pods quickly not you doctor i need you here
captain
computer activate the emergency command hologram authorisation janeway omega three
command codes transferred
youve wanted this chance for a long time now youve got it
aye captain
try to vent the radiation the rest of us will get out of the contaminated area and head for the nearest habitable planet
you need medical care
unless someone answers our distress call well have to made do with medkits well rendezvous as soon as its safe to come back on board take good care of voyager
you can count on me captain
the crew abandoned ship and i began to assess the damage caused by the mine but before i could even get started with the repairs i got some unexpected company
computer report
an alien vessel has locked on to voyager with a tractor beam
open a channel this is the federation starship voyager disengage your tractor beam
our scans show no lifesigns aboard your vessel identify yourself
i am the emergency command hologram
hologram
thats right now release my ship
your crews abandoned it it belongs to me now
i beg to differ computer target the vessels tractor emitter and fire
come about heading nine zero three mark six engage at warp two
warp engines are offline
evasive pattern beta four target the vessels engines
warning two vessels approaching bearing three three six mark one
reverse course full impulse
i managed to evade the other two ships and hid inside this nebula i vented the radiation repaired as many systems as i could but with no help lets just say im glad you found me
it wasnt easy picking up your homing signal
well i had to encrypt it every time i left the nebula i detected more ships searching for me
any idea who they are
no but ive analysed all of their weapons signatures they match the subspace mine it was a deliberate attempt to disable voyager
good thing you were here
what about the rest of the crew
not a word
make them comfortable were going to treat your injuries
who are you
my name is doctor kadan were in a quarren medical facility
my crew 
my understanding is that theyve all been rescued from their escape pods
treat my people first
everyone will be taken care of
thank you
what is that medication
an antiradiation serum perfectly safe
what are you doing
shes suffering from dysphoria syndrome dont worry its treatable
release her immediately
restrain him
captain no no
excuse me
hi
i believe we know each other
youre tuvok right we met last week at the shift briefing
before that before we were working here
oh i dont think so i mean were obviously not from the same place
still i believe i know you from the hospital perhaps
what hospital
i am not certain we were patients
you must have me confused with someone else ive never been sick enough to go to a hospital im sorry i have a lot of work to finish
please try to remember it may be important
is there a problem here
i think its just a misunderstanding
tuvok
shes right its er its er a misunderstanding
you dont look well maybe you should go to the infirmary
no no im fine fine er ill go back to my station sorry to have bothered you
what was that all about
im not sure strange man
and a terrible joke teller so we having dinner tonight
again
what you dont like my cooking
no its wonderful its just
im a perfectionist im going to keep trying until i make you the perfect meal
and then we stop eating together ill have dinner with you on one condition i make it
i think i can accept those terms
good now go back to your station before the efficiency monitor catches us fraternising
can i bring you something else
no thank you
i havent seen you in here before
you probably just didnt notice
oh id have noticed
well apparently you arent as observant as you think you are
oh really
ive been coming in here the same time every day for the past two weeks
well that explains it i usually work nights
me too
at the power distribution facility you see i am observant
tom i need you for a moment
ill be right there listen you should come back in when you get a night off its a lot more fun when theres a crowd
i dont really like crowds
well then maybe we could get together during the day sometime take a walk by the river
i dont think so
why not im a very engaging conversationalist
oh
yeah still want to get together
youre married
no
oh
enjoy your day
power to the secondary propulsion systems has been restored
kim todoctor report to astrometrics
on my way
any luck
ive scanned ships and planets in eighty three systems no humans no vulcans no bolians
maybe we can increase the range of the sensors by tying them into the main deflector
ive already done that
oh well we can boost resolution by
i appreciate your input doc but i didnt call you down here to help me scan im still feeling kind of queasy from that nectar
i treated you days ago
whatever you did hasnt worked maybe all those command subroutines are compromising your medical abilities
maybe all that sarcasm is compromising your natural charm
ive repaired the deuterium injectors brought secondary propulsion back online and soothed ensign kims upset tummy
good work why dont you get started on the ruptured plasma conduits on deck ten
cant you take care of those
i beg your pardon
emergency command hologram doesnt that suggest my place is here in voyagers command centre
look doc im impressed with the way you handled yourself while we were gone but right now weve got to prioritise
kim to chakotay
go ahead
ive found them commander theyre on an m class planet at maximum warp we can be there in less than three days
transfer the coordinates to the helm ill be in astrometrics doctor the command centre is yours
mmm smells good
its only burnt on the outside your cooking consoles a little temperamental huh
did you try talking to it
once i cut off the charred part im sure itll be fine
its good
really
lets go
where
i promised you dinner well just have to get it somewhere else
wait im not really hungry are you
no
lets stay here
i have personally interviewed several of the individuals on your crew manifest none of them know who you are nor have they heard of a starship voyager
id like to speak to them myself
thats not possible
if youre telling the truth you have nothing to lose by letting us talk to them
unlike other planets in this system we grant our guest workers the full protection of our laws
what exactly are you protecting them from
unscrupulous individuals attempting to acquire skilled labourers
were not trying to acquire labourers were trying to find our friends
most of your friends have excellent positions in the central power facility in the capital why would any of them want to travel thousands of light years to a planet on the other side of the galaxy when they have safe comfortable lives right here
because it isnt their home
i suggest you look elsewhere to increase your labour supply and if you attempt to disturb any of our citizens we will respond with force
any luck
theres no way to beam them through the shield grid
take us out of orbit
were not leaving them behind
no but i want these people to think we are
i hope the cooking consoles not being temperamental again
making a hot drink is one thing i can do
i told you
whats even better is being here with you are you comfortable
the blankets nice and warm
no i mean here with me
i cant remember being more comfortable in my life
yeah ill take care of it
hi listen i get off work in a few minutes i thought maybe you and i could go
you dont give up do you
you dont even know what i was going to say
let me guess youre going to invite me to take a walk by the river or maybe to your living quarters to admire the view
actually i was going to offer to introduce you to some people i met a couple expecting their first baby in a few weeks i thought you might want to get to know some other parents you know swap stories maybe even find a playmate for your baby if its a bad idea
no no its nice
listen im sorry about the other day
im the one who should be apologising i shouldnt have assumed
forget it
look its rare that i admit im wrong so you might as well take advantage of it while you can its been hard being alone with a baby coming i have a habit of keeping my guard up
thats understandable
its just a romantic relationship is really out of the question for me right now and when you started asking
how about a friend
what
well you said romance is out of the question but could you use a friend
any progress
ive spoken to the captains of eight vessels that left quarra in the last two weeks
no one knew anything about the crew
no but every one of them asked me if i was looking for employment apparently theres a severe labour shortage throughout this system theres a lot of competition for workers
that ambassador said most of our people were working at the main power facility i wonder if they still have any positions to fill
i can make some inquiries why
because you and i are going to find ourselves jobs
reentering orbit might arouse their suspicion
not if we take my ship
good idea neelix
commander youve spoken directly with several government officials you could be recognised
isnt reconstructive surgery one of your specialties
i still say you should have posed as a talaxian wed have made a striking pair
whiskers make me itch how did it go
as soon as i told the supervisor our qualifications he was eager to hire us he even helped me get a docking permit for my ship well be gainfully employed by tomorrow morning
here you go doc
give me your hand mister neelix
whats this
a subdermal transponder it will allow us to maintain an open comm link so we can transport you through the shield grid if theres trouble
hold position at maximum transporter range
aye sir
i assumed id be in charge during your absence commander
excuse me
an emergency command hologram programmed with over two million tactical subroutines outranks an ensign
a few words to the computer and this ensign can delete those subroutines
then youd be depriving yourself of a skilled leader for the sake of your ego
oh my ego
gentlemen work it out
aye sir
employee eight five eight three mister tuvok according to my records youve neglected to report for your last three inoculations these inoculations are for your protection a sick worker is not an efficient worker report to the infirmary
seven of nine
what
seven of nine its your designation
my employee number is eight five eight six take your hands off me
call security
i dont believe you are who you think you are
we dont belong here we dont belong here this isnt right we dont belong here
qualification level three in microkinetics you could use some improvement there level five in thermionic conversion good we lost a thermionic specialist yesterday
did he find a better job
health problems
someone you know
no just an unusual species
we have a diverse workforce our thermionic converters operate on a rotating frequency so they have to be closely monitored youll be required to report your readings to the controller at a regular interval any questions
are you listening to me
sorry sir im just excited to be here
carry on
kathryn
yes
its chakotay
im sorry
im new here the supervisor said you would be a good person to speak to if i had any questions
what can i help you with
nothing i just wanted to introduce myself
oh what did you say your name was
chakotay actually thats just what my friends call me my employment file lists my given name amal kotay
well whatever your name is im happy to help you any way i can
no no
youre experiencing a relapse of dysphoria syndrome this is going to make you feel better
get away from me
losing my job there was the best thing that ever happened to me
whys that
well so many rules and regulations it was like a military operation
i know what you mean report here reroute power there its almost like serving aboard a starship
have you ever done that
youre looking at the former captain of his own cargo vessel
hmm must be quite a life
what about you ever worked on a ship
oh no space travel makes me sick
so do you know most of the people that come in here
a lot of them this is a great place to work
seems like it
i could put in a good word for you to my employer
ah neelix
i was wondering when youd get here amal kotay this is my new friend tom paris
what can i get you
that looks good
i was assigned to the primary fusion chamber along with mulchaey and celes neither of them recognised me
let me guess they really love their jobs
its like theyve all been programmed to be happy here
its a safe bet theyre not going to leave willingly
here you go
hi how was your first day
not bad
would you and your friend like to join us
that would be nice
er actually i was hoping we could eat alone tonight
maybe another time
that was rude
im sorry i just er theres something id like to talk to you about
thanks
thank you for joining us
belanna im due for a break ill walk you to the transport
stop worrying ill be fine
its not you that im worried about
the baby will be fine too
so what i was thinking is if we were to combine our resources we would reduce our expenses
are you asking me to move in
yes i know its impulsive i know we havent known each other very long but things are so easy when were together and i just thought i
okay
what
maybe im out of my mind but lets try it
excuse me
it was my fault i should watch where im going
belanna
how do you know my name
what if i told you we were old friends
thats a ridiculous statement
i know it sounds strange but i can prove it to you
look im sorry but im late for work
let go of me
im not going to hurt you
no
security help
chakotay to voyager weve got belanna
lock on to neelixs signal and transport them to sickbay
acknowledged
help me
let her go
stop
harry i need an emergency transport now
sorry commander were under attack i had to raise shields
no leave me alone
were friends were trying to help you
no dont touch me
he turned into the access way
ill call for reinforcements
i think he went in there
be careful he might be armed
wait here
yes sir
hes deactivated a safety field alert emergency medical he may have tried to jump
i cant penetrate their shields
maybe we dont have to the battle of vorkado its in my tactical database a romulan captain disabled two attacking vessels by creating a photonic shock wave between the ships
howd he do that
watch and learn
i dont think theyll be bothering us again
good work lets go back for chakotay
five more ships on an intercept course
whats your tactical database telling you now
transporters are damaged shields are failing we have to retreat come up with a new plan
agreed
listen im sorry about my friend
excuse me
jaffen he wasnt very nice when i invited you to join us are you all right
im just a little tired first day on a new job
i know how that can be well i just wanted to let you know youre more than welcome to sit with us
actually i was thinking about going home
well if you change your mind were celebrating
whats the occasion
ive decided to move in with jaffen
congratulations
look among the patrons  yerid criminal investigations
we run an honest business
im looking for two people who disappeared after leaving here earlier this evening one was a young pregnant woman
belanna
you know her
i knew i should have walked her to the transport
why did you think someone might try to hurt her
this city is supposed to be safe
the person with her was described as short with mottled skin facial hair
sounds like someone who was in here earlier a worker from the plant
do you know his name
neelix i think
did you see him talking to anyone else while he was here
he had a friend amal something
can you describe him
i dont have to hes sitting right over
the scan on the left was performed during belannas last physical the one on the right just a few minutes ago the memory centres of her brain have been radically altered
people from our crew seemed to remember parts of their real lives but they got a lot of the details wrong tom knew his name that he was from earth but he said space travel made him sick
whoever did this is very sophisticated capable of selectively manipulating memory engrams some have been suppressed some altered others left intact
can you undo the damage
i believe so but itll take some time
i wish i could help
maybe you can shell require several treatments in between you could expose her to familiar sights and surroundings
say no more ill take her on a whirlwind tour of her own life
dont rush things this is going to be very traumatic for her
acute anxiety depression when i interviewed him he insisted that hes not who hes supposed to be that weve stolen his katra whatever that is
conclusions
trilobe regression complex polaraffective disorder
neuropsychiatry isnt a guessing game doctor ravoc
dysphoria syndrome
you have been studying my research
according to your work the condition is very rare
it is ive treated this man before apparently he has suffered a relapse recommended treatment
engrammatic resequencing is typically indicated
you seem sceptical
resequencing is a radical procedure
if he had a malignant tumour would you be afraid to cut it out
no
this syndrome is just as insidious it requires aggressive treatment get started
please help me
thats what were here to do
i want to know the status of employee eight five eight three
maybe its different where you come from but here its polite to say good morning
good morning
eight five eight three the man who was removed by security yesterday hes been hospitalised
is there any reason to believe that his condition might be contagious he came in contact with other workers some of them have expressed concern
well tell them not worry
excuse me am i intruding
what can we do for you
im investigating the disappearance of two of your employees
who
their names are neelix and torres
both of them failed to report for work today
employee nine three six three he didnt report for his shift either
id like to see his personnel file and ill need to interview anyone who may know where he is
why are you looking for him
i believe hes responsible for the disappearance of the other two
youve only been here three weeks where did you get all these things
im a collector
you collect spent plasma relays
i like to think of it as a decorative object
you know i think this would look better over there
youre not going to start telling me how to dress are you where are you going
to get the rest of my things
theres more
lights
what do you want
you told me you were moving out i needed a place to hide
jaffen knows where i am hell come looking for me
im hoping you wont tell him im here
they say you had something to do with the disappearance of a woman at the plant
i did her names belanna she was brought to this planet against her will something was done to her so shed forget her real life
and what you helped her get home
thats right there are other people in this city who im also trying to help im not here to hurt anyone you have to trust me
youre pointing a weapon at me
go ahead report me but if you do a lot of innocent people are going to suffer all im asking for is a place to stay until my friends come back for me
were going to have to do something about that arm
the waiter from the tavern
lieutenant tom paris our pilot and belanna torres our chief engineer that picture was taken on your honeymoon
it isnt possible
how else would we have it its an antique television you gave it to tom as a present
he watches cartoons
yes
how do i know that
because youre starting to remember
i wondered why he was so protective of me
ill be outside if you need me
your shift ended three hours ago
my friend jaffen employee one three two six he cut himself
removing property from these premises is not permitted
i know but hes just too stubborn to go to the hospital i promise ill have it back first thing in the morning
be sure that you do
display the personnel file for employee eight five eight three
access restricted security clearance verified
display all medical and historical data for this employees species
data unavailable
list all files accessed by this employee since hes been here
personnel files employee eight five eight two nozowo kashimuro employee eight five eight four janeway kathryn employee eight five eight five mckenzie william employee eight five eight six hansen annika employee eight five eight seven anderson lydia employee eight five eight eight torres belanna employee
you need a doctor
thatll have to wait till im back on voyager
voyager
my ship
you live onboard
for almost seven years
dont you ever want to stay in one place
you seem happy here
ive got a good job
ever consider doing something more challenging
my jobs challenging enough
you monitor reactor coils right youre obviously a very capable woman you could probably run that power plant
why would i want all that responsibility
whats that
my people are trying to contact me chakotay here
are you okay commander
for the time being can you get me out of here
were eight light years away
how are you transmitting this signal that far
were using a triaxialating frequency on a covariant
subspace band it was belannas idea
i take it shes feeling better
shes responded well to treatment
have you located anyone else from the crew
as a matter of fact im sitting with captain janeway right now
how is she
a little suspicious just like belanna was at first how soon can you get back into transporter range
we need
a couple more days to finish repairs what about the shield grid
i have an idea how to shut it down
until i get back to you lets maintain comm silence just in case were being monitored
understood good luck commander
why did you call me captain
because thats who you are
thats absurd so what are you saying that i was brought here by force too that my memories were manipulated
i know it sounds strange
helping you was a mistake
listen to me there are more then a hundred members of voyagers crew working at that power plant your crew and when our ship gets here ill be able to prove it to you look i dont want to force you to do anything you dont want to but dont you at least want to know the truth let me prove who i am hand me that dermal regenerator
were the same race
were more than that were friends
am i hearing you correctly youre actually helping this man he abducted one of the workers
shes a member of his crew
right and youre the captain dont you see hes trying to convince you that youll have a better life if you go with him do you want to go with him
no
then why are you risking everything we have
i was starting to think
stay where you are
i dont know them
i think you do and i think you were involved in their disappearance
im not the man youre looking for
yes the witness description doesnt fit you exactly but im sure thatll be explained once the doctor here finds evidence of dermal regeneration what is it
some kind of communications device implanted under his skin
remove it
listen to me you and i have something in common
oh
were both investigating disappearances if you answer my questions ill answer yours
i have an order to transfer this patient to division six
division six
neuropathology
we believe that hes mentally ill
hes lying how could they know that theyve never examined me
ill come with you
im sorry sir but my orders are to bring him for immediate treatment
this man is a suspect in a serious crime im not letting him out of my sight
if you check that order youll see its been approved by the director of investigations
my real name is chakotay im an officer aboard the federation starship voyager members of my crew were abducted and their memories were altered and they were put to work here i can give you names descriptions listen to me
smells good
pancakes with maple syrup are your favourite breakfast you know sometimes food is like time travel you inhale an aroma take a bite of something and suddenly bam youre back at the moment you first tasted it
theyre good im not experiencing time travel
what are you reading
personal logs
do you remember recording any of them
theyre not mine theyre toms
those are supposed to be private
well he is my husband
what do they say
theyre private but the way he describes me
he loves you
i guess so
how do you feel
its still a little foggy
that fog should lift as soon as the doctor finishes your treatments
yeah but what about the guy who recorded these logs
ive been analysing our scans of the quarren patrol ships that attacked us and i think ive devised a way of evading their sensors
you do have a knack for tactical planning
thats something ive been meaning to discuss with you once weve succeeded in this mission and im certain we will id like you to help me programme a new medical hologram
you dont like the idea of going back to your old job now that youve had a taste of command
im a skilled officer
no offence doc but that skill was programmed into you
yes
im sure once youre back to your old self youll be happy being a fulltime doctor again commander chakotays hailing us were receiving you sir go ahead
im having trouble with my transceiver this may be to last chance we have to talk
whats your status
im almost ready to shut down the shield grid im sending you encrypted instructions theyll tell you where and when to enter orbit
we have it commander
chakotay out
well now you that you know where to find voyager
ill have three ships with me they wont escape again
if youd done your job the first time we wouldnt have a problem now
dont you have patients to attend to
yes sir ive been thinking this is the second person weve admitted with dysphoria syndrome in two days and they both work at the power plant maybe we should issue a health alert examine the rest of the workers
do you think im incompetent
sir
this man is in charge of personnel at the power facility ive informed him of the situation
were already taking steps to ensure the safety of all our employees
im sorry to have bothered you
no need to apologise doctor your concern for your patients is admirable but dont worry this man is already responding to treatment i expect a full recovery
why would this tuvok be collecting information about his coworkers
i dont know but the name on one of those files is belanna torres they both began working at the plant on the same day along with one hundred thirty six others including myself
whats unusual about that
more than a hundred skilled employees most of them the same species acquired in a single day during a labour shortage youll also note that every one of them was processed with the central hospital when they arrived
its routine for new workers to be examined
yes by quarantine control but everyone on this list all of them were processed through division six
you came through neuropathology
thats what the records indicate but i dont remember being there
what do you expect me to do
you can start by interviewing mister tuvok youll find him at the hospital
why is he there
he became emotionally unstable
even if i wanted to help you i couldnt
why not
the director of investigations relieved me of duty this morning
yerid i thought that was you have you found out anything about belanna
he cant assist you hes been relieved of duty
oh
this mans also in tuvoks file
what file
why dont you tell him
tell me what
i cant go back to the hospital and start asking questions id be reported
maybe i can help
recently ive been
im a doctor you can trust me
ive been experiencing some disturbing thoughts i dont believe its anything serious but i would like to speak with someone
well youve come to the right place
guest labour code green employee eight five eight six
hansen annika youve been a patient here before
yes when i first arrived
you were treated for dysphoria syndrome
i dont recall that
these disturbing thoughts you mentioned would you characterise them as hallucinations
whats the cause of this syndrome
were conducting studies to determine that fortunately we have one of the foremost experts on the condition working here
id like to speak with this expert
doctor kadans very busy
so am i perhaps i should return when hes free
wait here ill find him
yes
my name is yerid im from criminal investigations
how can i help you
kathryn janeway
yes
do you know this man
no
i thought maybe youd met him
why
he was found in your former living quarters in possession of a dermal regenerator that you removed from the plant
i was the one who helped him
jaffen he said he was from a starship and that members of his crew had been abducted
he was obviously lying
i want to know everything he told you
how could she just walk out
she was a voluntary patient there was no reason for security to stop her she accessed sixty four restricted files all of them for people diagnosed with dysphoria syndrome according to the records those patients were all admitted on the same day and youre listed as the attending physician in every case
oh yes i remember quite quite an outbreak
youve never mentioned it
well im sorry if i havent kept you properly informed about my patients
everyone of them was discharged to the main power authority that supervisor you were talking to thats where he worked
i explained that to you i was informing him about a potential health threat
that plant worker amal kotay he claimed that his friends had been abducted and put to work after having their memories altered
what are you implying
youre making false diagnoses selectively changing what people remember and then sending them to work at the power plant
very good doctor
why
a physician with more experience would be able to see this in the larger context the true public health threat is the labour shortage and the only cure is to find more skilled workers
were doctors were not supposed to harm patients
were helping them to lead productive happy lives
by altering their memories
the treatment i provide improves their lives and makes them better workers in turn our economy benefits
youre profiting from this arent you
doesnt a physician deserve to be compensated for his services
ill report you
to whom my research is funded by the ministry of health
well criminal investigations then
as you may recall the director of investigations was the one who ordered amal kotay be placed under my care
does everyone know about this
not everyone just a few trusted associates the question is are you going to be one of them
shes considered dangerous
shes never been in here
youre sure
i dont think id forget that face
if you do see her report it immediately she needs to be hospitalised
its safe now
thank you
well if you really want to thank me you can tell me whats going on
it appears this chakotay was telling the truth
so every worker at the plant had their memories altered
i dont believe its every worker your name didnt appear in doctor kadans patient files but mine did so did yours
we should report this to the authorities
ill need more evidence before i start making accusations
chakotay said he had proof of my real identity aboard a ship called voyager
how can we locate it
when his crew contacted him they were using a triaxialating frequency on a covariant subspace band
theres a subspace transponder at the power plant
im going back to the plant to try to contact this ship i understand if you dont want to be involved
ive been involved from the moment i met you
if i were to return to the hospital in your custody it would give us an opportunity to help chakotay and tuvok
i had to sedate her she wouldnt come voluntarily
her conditions obviously worsened ill treat her
there are some other patients id like to interview
these people cant be disturbed
i suggest you comply
be careful
were being hailed
on screen
starship voyager
captain
why dont you just call me kathryn
yes maam wheres commander chakotay
hospitalised
he told me you had proof of who some of us really are
we do
youre the woman who was abducted
chakotay was supposed to deactivate the shield grid so we could transport you and the others to safety if you could find a way to shut down main power the shield grid will go down too
will you help us
were under attack three ships
please shut down the shield
jaffen
stop
dont move
stay where you are
i hope you didnt think i abandoned you
never occurred to me we need to shut down the main generators
so much for evading their sensors
the only way they couldve found us is if they knew exactly where to look
transporters are offline
evacuate
im getting it shut down
well never get to the generator controls
maybe we dont have to
what are you doing
if i can make the computer think the core is going to overload the main power should automatically shut down
ask them to give us some privacy
youre dismissed
disconnect them
doctor ravoc why is this man here
dysphoria syndrome
were losing shields
any advice from your tactical database
nothing relevant
how many escape pods do we have left
five
stand by to eject three of them
i dont think abandoning ship is the answer
neither do i can you create a dampening field around the briefing room thatll mask our lifesigns
i believe so why
watch and learn
your crews abandoned you again i suggest you surrender your vessel
you should realise by now that im not programmed to do that
bravo ensign
belanna i need those transporters
youd better hurry up
come on do it
warning core overload detected initiating emergency shutdown
the shield grids failing
belanna
transporters are coming online now
if it werent for your efforts this whole conspiracy might never have been uncovered
whatll happen to the workers
well weve identified several thousand of doctor kadans patients once theyre treated theyll be repatriated
we appreciate everything youve done
this way
whats that for
for taking care of me even when you didnt know who i was
ow what was that for
flirting with your customers
i was a victim of mind control
i can see why youd rather live here
id offer you a position i could always use another skilled engineer but as the captain it wouldnt really be appropriate for me to
fraternise with a member of your crew well at least my memories werent tampered with according to the medical reports i really did come to quarra looking for a better life and now that ive been promoted i guess ive succeeded
promotion
they had to replace our shift supervisor something about acquiring workers illegally
congratulations you deserve it
i thought you might like these back to remind you of our time together
i wont need souvenirs to remember you
captain on the bridge
ready to go
it may not have been real chakotay but it felt like home if you hadnt come after me i never wouldve known that i had another life
are you sorry i showed up
not for a second resume course mister paris
aye sir
feels heavy babys first tricorder
not exactly
thank you im sure shell love it what is it
a pleenok vulcans use them to train their infants in primary logic
never too early to train those synapses eh tuvok let me see that i love a good puzzle
this ones from mister kim
starfleet diapers
standard issue
well we know who to call if theres a containment breach
now that your borg implants have been removed you might think about having children of your own one day
one day i have been considering some less radical changes in my personal life
such as
i realise i dont have a rank but i would like to request a uniform
consider it done the doctor tells me you dont need to regenerate any more i can arrange some quarters for you unless you enjoy curling up in the cargo bay
a bed would be more comfortable since i arrived on voyager your guidance has been invaluable thank you captain
all i did was chart the course youre the one who made the journey
seven its traditional for everyone to share their best wishes for the baby i thought you might like to start
to the newest member of our crew may all her desires be fulfilled except for one so shell always have something to strive for
very good
hear hear
and may she inherit a sense of logic from her mother
ill drink to that
that was strange
care to explain
i wish i could long range sensors picked up an energy discharge but now its gone there theres another one
theyre occurring approximately five point nine light years ahead
source
were too far away to get a clear reading
bridge to seven of nine
go ahead
report to the astrometrics lab
acknowledged computer end programme
i wasnt able to find the cause of the discharges but the region ahead contains unusual amounts of subspace radiation and metallic debris
vessels
not within range but ill have more data once we move closer
i see no reason to alter course keep an eye on your sensors
yes captain
now on to more pressing matters does belanna suspect anything
not a clue
good mess hall fourteen hundred hours be on time i dont want to spoil the surprise i expect both of you to show up
ill be busy here
whats wrong seven no baby showers in the collective
im sure you can spare a few minutes
if its any consolation i share your discomfort with social gatherings
they seem to occur with alarming frequency
mister neelix would argue that they improve morale
i have been looking for ways to improve my social skills perhaps ill attend
well it certainly is efficient no clutter plenty of room to move around but its a little impersonal dont you think
explain
well these are your quarters seven they should reflect your individuality how about a table and a couple of chairs give yourself a place to work entertain guests try to add a little colour photographs artwork knickknacks
knickknacks
little things like the wood carvings in ensign kims quarters
ive never been to ensign kims quarters but i suppose i could replicate some items and disperse them throughout the room
thats a start some people like to display pictures of family and friends
theres a photograph of my parents in the ships database ill make a copy and place it in a frame
good good
a multispectral star chart might enhance this bulkhead
or a painting
a painting of a star chart
i was thinking of something more abstract more artistic drapes nothing livens up a room like good window dressing not to mention the added privacy
privacy were in space
you never know when well be docking at a crowded space port but well have to make sure that they match the carpet im thinking of a talaxian mosaic tulaberry blue stripes with an orange inlay
i appreciate your aesthetic insights but i believe i can proceed on my own
enter
am i interrupting
please come in
love what youve done with the place
were in the process of decorating
maybe this will help consider it a housewarming gift
its beautiful what is it
a dream catcher according to native american mythology it wards off nightmares
im impressed
ive familiarised myself with your culture
now that youll be sleeping instead of regenerating i thought it might come in handy
im sure it will thank you
ill let you two find a place to hang that but it would look perfect right above the bed pleasant dreams
it was thoughtful of you to stop by
on move in day i wouldnt miss it
i suppose this makes you my inaugural guest id be a negligent host if i didnt offer you a beverage tea
that might be difficult no replicator
another flaw in the decor
ill requisition one for you first thing tomorrow
id appreciate that commander
chakotay were off duty we can drop the formalities
yes sir
i enjoyed your toast today youve come a long way i hope to see more
you will
good night
chakotay as you might know ive taken an interest in culinary science im preparing a meal tomorrow night and i thought perhaps you could attend to evaluate my work
id be happy to
nineteen hundred hours
ill bring the wine and the furniture
then you accept
its a date
rockabye baby in the space dock when the core blows the shuttle will rock when the hull breaks the shuttle will fall and down will come baby shuttle and all
are you trying to soothe the infant or traumatise her
the lyrics are rather grim but its the melody they respond to i recorded twenty nine in all including a couple of klingon lullabies my favourite is quong vaj ocht sleep little warrior i could tell by the look on their faces that my gift made quite an impression
no doubt
i wish youd been there it was a lovely shower tom and belanna were disappointed that you didnt attend
i was occupied
are you experiencing any shoulder pain
yes
hmm your biradial clamp is out of alignment by point three microns im afraid it will have to be repaired
cant you simply extract the component
not if you want to keep using that arm i know its an inconvenience but until we can find a way to remove your cybernetic systems theyll have to be maintained its a minor procedure we might as well take care of it now
i prefer to wait
well be done in an hour
i have research to complete
oh i suppose we can put it off until next weeks physical i also noticed that your electrolyte levels are down by twelve percent have you missed any regeneration cycles
last night
dont tell me more research this must be some project mind if i ask what youre working on
its complicated
how do you mean
my personal life is none of your concern
i wasnt aware you had a personal life
report
it was an energy discharge two hundred thousand kilometres starboard
it produced a level nine shockwave
some kind of weapon
possibly
another one five million kilometres to port
a shockwave is approaching
full power to the shields
our warp fields destabilising
im detecting another distance fifty thousand kilometres
turn our bow into the wavefront itll minimise the damage
sorry captain there wasnt enough time
weve lost warp drive
im reading another distance twenty six million kilometres too far to pose a threat
if they are weapons they dont seem to be directed at us
or whoevers firing them is a lousy shot
astrometric sensors recorded the explosions i believe its a long range subspace warhead the debris in this region suggests that dozens have been fired in the last several weeks
the warhead destroyed something what was it
it appeared to be an unmanned probe
this is all very intriguing but id just as soon get out of here before we cross paths with another one of these things where do we stand on repairs
subspace radiation from the explosions is making it difficult to create a stable warp field lieutenant torres estimates forty eight hours
can you find a way to detect the warheads before they emerge from subspace
i believe so the weapons create minor gravimetric distortions as they approach the subspace barrier but i need to recalibrate my sensors to isolate the effect
do it even a few seconds warning would help us
yes captain
your duty shift doesnt begin for two hours
the doctor sent me to relieve you early he wants you to spend more time regenerating
i see hes enlisted an ally
dont kill the messengersophocles oedipus rex ive been studying earth literature as a part of my academy training
continue these scans of the subspace barrier look for any gravimetric distortions
run another diagnostic on the injector ports make sure theyre aligned
theyre aligned i checked
check again come to join the party were trying to cold start the warp core for the fifteenth time
perhaps this will enhance your day its a belated gift for your baby shower i apologise for my absence
oh
proceed
theyre lined with biothermal insulation your infants feet will be protected even if the external temperature drops below minus forty degrees celsius
well theyre certainly unique thank you
youre welcome i wish to ask you a personal question
shoot
you have an appealing coiffure what is your grooming regimen
youre asking me what i do with my hair
yes
um well nothing too elaborate sonic shower a little engine grease thinking about a new look
perhaps ill keep you apprised if youd like
please do
was that seven of nine
there must be an alien intruder on board
computer make the following modifications to holodeck file seven of nine alpha three personal quarters
modifications complete
begin programme
you look perfect give me a hand with this
im surprised your starfleet training didnt include cork extraction
i must have been sick that day
looks like wines off the menu
unless you brought a phaser
never on the first date
assist me slice these vegetables transversally in five millimetre increments
aye aye
that smells delicious
our appetizer is braised leeks primary course rack of lamb with wild rice
no dessert
dessert will be a surprise
i cant wait
does this contain enough sodium chloride for your taste
could use another point six milligrams but youre the chef
i concur more salt
liszt
chopin ive discovered that classical music has intriguing mathematical properties
do you play an instrument
the doctors been giving me piano lessons
id love to hear you play
i require more practice
your technique is flawed
sorry im a replicator man
use your left hand to guide the food observe closely pay attention to the vegetable
youre beautiful when youre chopping i dont mean to sound like an old holonovel but youve got a wonderful smile
it wasnt a smile it was a smirk
oh no it was a smile i could check the internal sensors if youd like
remain still
you have an intriguing facial structure
ill take that as a compliment
i require more practice
youre doing just fine
whats wrong
nothing
i wasnt aware you had a personal life
chakotay to seven of nine
chakotay to seven respond
go ahead
report to astrometrics weve found something
yes commander
good morning
good morning
youve found something
at first we thought it was another one of the probes then icheb picked up an automated transmission its a warning beacon
you have entered subspace munitions range four three four evacuate immediately
apparently this entire region is an alien testing ground
weve been sending out emergency hails but so far no response whoevers conducting these tests could be dozens of light years away any progress detecting their warheads
not yet
you seem a little distracted
im fine
its not like you to be late for a duty shift rough night
not at all
ill be on the bridge if you find anything
better late than never titus livius a history of rome
youre relieved get some rest
bravo
you approve
approve im amazed i was expecting chopsticks i had no idea you were so good
the doctors an efficient instructor
it wont be long before youre giving a recital for the entire crew
the doctor did suggest that i accompany him during his next operatic performance your turn
unfortunately i dont play but id love to hear you again and this is one of my favourites
you want me to stop
no i want you to play
i dont understand
look your technique is flawless but try to put a little more heart into the piece more of yourself
thats all right keep going tell me what youre feeling
my tempo is erratic
not what youre thinking what youre feeling your emotions
frustration anxiety
stop thinking about the notes just play
i cant
yes you can dont you see whats happening the metronome is holding you back it gives you a sense of order but it also cuts you off from your feelings remember when you first came aboard the thought of disconnecting from the hive mind terrified you this is no different it doesnt have to be perfect
eight hundred thousand kilometres off the starboard bow
bridge to seven of nine
go ahead commander
we need those sensor calibrations
ill need a moment to return to my station
that would be a good idea
hull fracture deck twelve
seven of nine report
stand by captain
lieutenant paris isolate subspace band omicron theta
acknowledged
direct your sensors to
coordinates one seven eight mark two six
nothing there
correction one seven eight mark three six
i can see them two warheads are about to emerge adjusting course
full power to the forward shields
impact in five four three two
shields are holding
why wasnt seven at her post
good question maybe you should ask her
it was your responsibility to locate those warheads
i succeeded
not before we took heavy damage you told chakotay youd have those sensor calibrations hours ago
the work took longer than i anticipated
it mightve gone faster if youd stayed at your post as you were ordered to do
i didnt realise i was confined to the astrometrics lab
you were on duty this isnt the first time youve left your station over the past few days holodeck two youve logged a lot of time in there mind if i ask why well it must be something important seven forty nine hours in six days
i was running a simulation
of what
a new gravimetric array ive been developing i wanted to perfect the design before i brought it to you
i appreciate your efforts to improve our systems but i cant have you dividing your time right now when the ships on alert i expect you to perform your duties if you need to leave your post inform commander chakotay understood
yes captain i apologise for my lapse in judgment
we all make mistakes seven ive even been known to make a few myself it sounds intriguing your new gravimetric array when this crisis is over id be happy to take a look maybe i can lend a hand
ive analysed the sensor data from that last barrage ive refined your detection method well be able to see the weapons ten point three seconds earlier
the captain will be pleased
have i offended you
no youve done nothing wrong i was negligent in my duties as a result voyager was nearly destroyed i was hoping you could provide a quotation to help alleviate my guilt
i i cant think of one but id be happy to search the database
that wont be necessary stay here until i return
where are you going
to correct an error
computer activate chakotay simulation
come in
i hope youre not allergic antarian moon blossoms extremely rare i had to smuggle them out of airponics dont tell neelix i thought id cook for you tonight how does roasted chicken sound i slaved over the replicator for hours not hungry
i called you here to thank you
for what
the past few days have been memorable
to say the least youre ending this
in a manner of speaking yes
why
our relationship is interfering with my responsibilities on voyager
i could speak to the captain have her cut back on your duty shifts seven the past few days have been more than memorable theyve been an important step forward for both of us dont throw that away
im sorry commander
youre making a mistake
no im trying to correct one
ask yourself why you want to end this is it out of a sense of duty or something else every time you move closer to your emotions you back away like hiding behind that metronome
your analogy is flawed
is it i think youre afraid that embracing your humanity will make you weak less than perfect but think about what you stand to gain
its irrelevant
no its not real intimacy with another person nothings more relevant
i must return to my station
stay here with me
this ship needs me
so do i
i cant function this way
youre not a drone anymore youre human
stop
seven whats wrong
sickbay medical emergency
seven computer locate seven of nine
seven of nine is in holodeck two
what happened
we were having an argument then she just collapsed
her cortical node is shutting down shes going into neural shock and what happened to her facial implants
i thought you removed all her cybernetic systems
computer end programme
commander
if youre looking for your other holographic friend hes offline at the moment your cortical node began to shut down fortunately i managed to stabilise it before there was any permanent damage
it was functioning properly when you examined me two days ago
im going to run a diagnostic on your entire cortical array but it might help if i knew what you were doing before you collapsed did you suffer a physical injury of some kind
no
were you exposed to any unusual radiation
no
what exactly were you doing in there
research
that simulation of commander chakotay mentioned that the two of you were having an argument was that part of your research i couldnt help but notice that youd created some quarters for yourself a new dress dinner for two
i trust youll respect doctorpatient confidentiality
of course
ive been conducting simulations to explore different aspects of my humanity
such as
social activities friendships with the crew intimate relations
i take it our first officer is your romantic interest
commander chakotay seemed like an appropriate choice he has many admirable qualities
so he does what prompted all this
unimatrix zero ive been trying to recreate some of the experiences i had there ever since it was destroyed my life has seemed incomplete i wanted to feel those emotions again
well this is encouraging you might be ready to start forming deeper relationships im proud of you seven
your pride is misplaced i intend to delete the programmes
why
i can no longer perform my duties efficiently my personal life has become a distraction
its supposed to be a distraction you simply have to find the right balance between work and recreation
inform me when you finish the diagnostic
seven for what its worth you have excellent taste your quarters they suited you
antimatter flow stable injector ports aligned that should do it
torres to the bridge looks like weve got warp drive back
well done tom
with pleasure
im detecting another subspace warhead
range
twelve million kilometres closing from astern
red alert wheres the target probe
its on a totally different trajectory
when we engaged the engines the warhead must have diverted from its target and locked onto our warp signature
evasive manoeuvres
its matching our course eight million kilometres
can you get a weapons lock
affirmative
photon torpedoes full spread
our torpedoes have been neutralised
five million kilometres
bridge to seven of nine
here captain
can you get me anything on
the warheads internal circuitry
stand by i have it
what can you tell me about the detonator
the weapon is armed with proximity resonance circuitry
whats the activation frequency
four point eight four gigahertz
i may be able to disarm it with an antiresonance pulse
do it
two million kilometres
initiating the pulse
seven status
the warheads rotating its activation frequency its still armed
one million kilometres
can you compensate
negative
captain i believe i can disarm
the warhead
how
by extracting the detonator with our transporter
at this velocity the device is too small youd never get a lock
i can use the sub
micron imager to focus our targeting scanners please give me transporter control
eight hundred thousand
all right seven its up you
i have a lock energising the detonators protected by tritanium shielding i can penetrate it but not at this distance well have to wait until its closer
five hundred thousand
status
not yet captain
four
three two brace for impact
doctor youve come to deliver unpleasant news
is it that obvious ive completed my diagnostic what you experienced was no malfunction your cortical node was designed to shut down your higher brain functions when you achieve a certain level of emotional stimulation
clarify
it appears to be a failsafe mechanism to deactivate drones who start to regain their emotions knowing the borg it makes perfect sense finding ones heart is the surest road to individuality
im no longer linked to the hive mind
the technologys built into your node it simply remained dormant until now
can you repair me
possibly ive been thinking about a way to reconfigure the microcircuitry i wont lie to you seven it would entail multiple surgeries and the recovery might be difficult but i believe we could eventually succeed ill prepare the surgical bay we can begin tomorrow morning
no
without the procedure you wont be able to continue your simulations
ive experienced enough humanity for the time being they were only holographic fantasies doctor an inefficient use of my time
you dont really believe that
the failsafe device will insure that im no longer distracted
thats the borg talking not you as your physician as your friend im asking you to let me proceed
i need to regenerate
seven
goodnight doctor
wheres the fire
fire
you seem to be in a hurry
i have to finish my report on the subspace warheads
the ships out of danger thanks to you youve earned a break why dont you join me in the mess hall neelix is going to give a cooking lesson talaxian tenderloin in ten minutes
im no longer interested in cooking
then come for the company belannas going to be there tuvok even promised to show up itll be fun
i appreciate your offer another time perhaps
you know you should try socialising with the crew a little more it might do you some good
though it was a blatant violation of the prime directive kirk saved the pelosians from extinction just as he had the baezians and the chenari many years earlier finally in the year 2270 kirk completed his historic five year mission and one of the greatest chapters in starfleet history came to a close a new chapter began when kirk regained command of the enterprise
how many more chapters are there
thirty four
this was supposed to be a twenty minute presentation
i was trying to be thorough i could shorten the report
that wont be necessary you obviously know the subject matter congratulations cadet you have just passed early starfleet history
thank you captain
janeway to security
who are you
i know hes grown since you last saw him kathy but dont tell me you cant see the family resemblance this is my son q im a little hurt you didnt recognise junior you are his godmother after all
the last time i saw him he was an infant
four years ago in human time you called me adorable
you remember
i may have looked like an infant but i was still a q maybe you should have picked a better godparent
i wonder if its too late to ask jeanluc
what do you want q
well juniors taking a little vacation from the continuum i recommended he spent it with you
why
oh hes always been fascinated by the old mans stories about humanity i thought it was time he had some first hand experience
i am flattered that you would entrust me with your first born but i really dont have time
hes as quiet as a zizznian church mouse youll forget hes even here
well if youre going to stay well need to lay down a few ground rules
i make my own rules
im not detecting either q
i want to be alerted if they resurface keep running scans
scan scan scan thats all you people ever do ive been through every deck on this ship and do you know what ive seen bipeds pushing buttons bipeds replacing relays bipeds running diagnostics when are you going to do something interesting
say hello to q everyone
we could fly into fluidic space and fight species 8472 or we could detonate a few omega molecules what do you say
no
twenty minutes observing humanity im already bored i guess im just going to have to amuse myself
torres to the captain i need you in engineering
one dance belanna thats all i ask one dance
if he doesnt stop his little light show the warp cores going to breach
relax its a party
this party is over get your guests off my ship
i like you aunt kathy youve got gumption but what you dont have is unlimited control of space matter and time which means i give the orders around here
i could assemble a security team and attempt to take engineering by force
we all know that wouldnt do any good
besides ill bet thats exactly the kind of reaction hes hoping for
hes doing everything he can to get under our skin
if we deny him the satisfaction of a response he may become bored and return to the continuum
talk about perfection
if youre attempting to embarrass me you wont succeed
im just observing humanity arent you going to scamper away make some futile attempt to cover yourself
coffee black
make it yourself
you can thank qs son he thought the computer needed more personality
charming
ive been giving some thought to the q situation maybe ignoring him isnt the best solution
im open to suggestions
he may be omnipotent but hes still a young man in need of guidance perhaps if someone were to approach him as a friend
you think he needs a mentor
exactly
are you volunteering
well i am good with children
q is no ordinary child
im no ordinary mentor
can i help you kitchen rat
i thought you and i could spend some time together
ah excellent manoeuvre
what are you watching
whats it look like its a battle between the vojeans and wyngari
we past through that region a few months ago they were at peace
not any more watch this
you have to stop this
its not like theres anything else to do
we could play kadiskot
are there explosions in kadiskot
well no
then im not interested
instead of hurting people maybe you could help them the wyngari are suffering a food shortage on their world maybe you could use your powers to
you know what talaxian you talk to much
his jaws been fused and his vocal cords removed i might be able to undo some of the cosmetic damage but only q can restore his voice
janeway to the bridge report
ive got a surprise for you captain come see
q said i should pay attention to how you humans react under pressure
is this enough pressure
were venting plasma
reroute power to aft shields and return fire
youre just prolonging the inevitable
weve defeated the borg before well do it again
not this time
weapons are offline
im losing thrusters
shields are down
we were just getting to the good part
if the continuums told you once theyve told you a thousand times dont provoke the borg now i want you to give aunt kathy your word you wont do it again
oh he wont do it again because hes leaving now
excuse us son the grownups need a moment in private
he isnt so bad once you get to know him hes just misunderstood
he tried to kill my crew
no one was hurt i repaired the damage to your ship i even gave your pet talaxian his vocal cords back everythings exactly as it was
and how long do you think it will take your son to come up with another way to amuse himself if you knew he was dangerous why did you send him here ah is this another lesson for humanity
its supposed to be a lesson for him think back to my last visit i made you the offer of a lifetime
asking me to mate with you was hardly the offer of a lifetime
if you hadnt turned me down i wouldnt have been forced to mate with that other q
oh get to the point
my point is junior was suppose to inspire peace and compassion but instead of order hes brought chaos hes been starting wars among innocent species tampering with primordial gene pools punching holes in the fabric of space time
wheres his mother been during all this
shes been so humiliated by his antics shes disowned him shes blamed me for everything ive managed to undo most of the damage but that wasnt good enough for the continuum theyre hounding me to straighten the boy out thats why i brought him here in hopes that your vaunted starfleet ideals would rub off on him obviously that hasnt happened
you cant just dump your child on someone and hope he learns something
i cant
he needs to be parented
and how exactly am i supposed to do that q is the first child born in the continuum which makes me the first parent i dont even know where to begin
you could start by spending time with him
urgh
parenthood is more than just cleaning up your childs messes you need to set an example its the only way hell learn
of course once he begins to know me better hell idolise me then hell do anything i say kathy
youre a genius
ive made a full sensor sweep theres no sign of any more borg vessels
the boy
hes gone
i am going to my quarters you have the bridge
i take it back youre not a genius i should have known better than to take the advice of a human
q
your brilliant plan didnt work i smothered the boy with attention spent every waking moment with him but things only got worse
youve been gone for less than ten minutes
on your temporal plane maybe but in q time weve spent years together now hes embarrassed to be seen with me and its all your fault
my fault
tell me how you plan to rectify the situation
what happened after you left voyager
q got away from me and rearranged to tectonic plates on bozel prime
did you punish him
well i tried to get him to apologise to all sixteen billion bozelians but he got angry and stopped talking to me
so you gave in to him
i told him he could shift as many continents as he liked as long as no one got hurt
youre not going to do your son any favours by indulging him you need to make him understand that there are consequences to his actions
consequences hmm kathy i take it back you are a genius
i think thats long enough
what was that for
whats wrong you didnt enjoy life as an oprelian amoeba
no i was shapeless and slimy the only thing to eat was paramecia
sounds unpleasant im sure youll do whatever you can to avoid returning to that petrie dish
what are you talking about
the continuum and i have come to an agreement about your future either you become an upstanding citizen of the cosmos or youll be sentenced to eternity as a amoeba hows that for consequences
youd turn your own son into a microscopic lifeform
you have one week to change your ways i suggest you make the most of it
fine ill see you in seven days
weve temporarily relieved you of your powers to ensure that youre on your best behaviour with the captain
youre leaving me here
i though we agreed that you were going to take a more active role
id like to kathy but we both know that youre a million times the parent i am
im not a parent
maybe not in the biological sense but youre certainly a mommy to this crew just look how quickly you housebroke that borg drone
its taken years for seven to become an individual youre asking me to change your son in one week
im sure youll think of something
what if she doesnt
then its singlecellular city for you my boy
im getting off this ship
janeway to security
what you no longer have q is unlimited control of space matter and time which means i give the orders around here do i make myself clear your quarters
the petri dish was less cramped
get some sleep youre going to need it
what for
im preparing a curriculum for you to follow while youre here youre going to learn respect
and responsibility
dont tell me youre actually going through with qs plan
i may not approve of his methods but for once his heart seems to be in the right place i think his desire to help you is genuine
he abandoned me on an antiquated flying machine run by primates
we primates are your only hope
seven days how hard can it be
seven of nine will be instructing you in spatial causality you will learn how your actions can have widespread repercussions
i read the padd youre going to tell me how i cant create anomaly a without causing phenomenon b which in turn affects civilisation c right
im icheb
oh i know who you are youre the drone with the kirk fixation
you would be wise to follow ichebs example by applying himself hes become a valued member of this crew
can i see you naked again
computer run diplomacy scenario twelve alpha
the planetoid is in nausicaan space it belongs to us now
after you
come anywhere near it and well attack you
you cant intimidate us weve as much right to mine that dilithium as you do
what are you doing here starfleet
computer freeze programme i assume youre familiar with these species
nausicaan bolian cardassian romulan ferengi and bajoran
theyre fighting over the mining rights to a planetoid your job is to settle the dispute
these aliens mean nothing to me what do i care if they cant get along
one of your responsibilities as a q is to maintain order in the universe right
so ive been told
well if you cant help these races come to an agreement there might be a war the alpha quadrant would be thrown into chaos why dont we try running the first scenario together
i dont need your help i can do this myself
if you want to try be my guest ill be back in thirty minutes to check on your progress and remember security is right outside
computer resume programme
the planetoid is in nausicaan space it belongs to us now
you cant intimidate us we have as much right to mine that dilithium as you do
arent you supposed to be supervising our young guest
he says he doesnt need supervision
and you accepted that
of course not im just giving him a chance to fail then hell have to ask for some help
sounds like a good strategy let me know how it goes
settling the planetoid predicament didnt take very long so i used the rest of the time to convince the cardassian to apologise for the occupation of bajor hows that for order in the universe
welcome its so nice to see you this evening i hope youre hungry step right up theres plenty for everyone enjoy
do you ever stop
oh im sorry i forgot my talking annoys you too bad you cant just shut me up again huh crewman biddle where have you been hiding yourself i havent seen you in days
if it isnt drone boy you come to put me to sleep with another one of your presentations
actually i was wondering if youd like to participate in some recreational activities
i dont have the time aunt kathys forcing me to write an historical essay on the q continuum
thats a challenging subject
ive never written an essay before i dont know where to start
the origin of the q seems like the most logical place followed by an analysis of their interaction with humanity you could conclude with a description of the events that lead you to voyager
would you mind writing some of this down for me
ill get a padd
insightful informative im impressed too bad you didnt write it
what do you mean
id recognise ichebs style anywhere
he gave me a few notes on my first draft thats all i negotiated a peace treaty between six belligerent species in just thirteen minutes
when commander chakotay left the room you altered their personality subroutines to make them more agreeable we may be common bipeds but were not stupid your training is over go back to your room and wait for your father to return
if you dont help me the continuum will turn me into an amoeba
i wanted to help you but instead of trying to live up to your potential you cheated
do you think its easy to live up to my potential i was supposed to be the saviour of the q continuum tell me how do you save a race thats already omnipotent
those were the qs expectations not mine all i asked was that you make a sincere effort but you werent even willing to try
please aunt kathy youre my only hope
oh im glad you finally realised that now if your motives are sincere im willing to give you another chance but step out of line again and im through with you understood
understood
dismissed
captain this is for you its a new draft of my essay i know you didnt ask for one but i felt i owed it to you for giving me a second chance
i q an insiders view of the continuum if the essays half as clever as the title im sure ill enjoy it
lieutenant paris has offered to give me a piloting lesson i thought you might like to join us
thanks but i have to help crewman chell scrub the plasma conduits
i think youve earned a break this is the only time off im giving you i suggest you take advantage of it
yes maam piloting lesson huh where are we going
steady ease up a little on the thrusters
in case you forgot im mortal now id appreciate it if you didnt fly us into a rock
maybe q could take over for a little while
what do you say you want a turn at the wheel
ordinarily a q wouldnt demean himself by operating primitive machinery but these arent ordinary circumstances
did i do something wrong
just a little ion imbalance in the impulse drive nothing to worry about
well its very distracting cant you fix it
i could but wed have to go back to voyager and run diagnostics if you two dont mind cutting your lesson a little short
that wont be necessary in fact i barely hear it any more do you hear it
hear what
going up
ill catch the next one
oh you cant get away from me that easily
its only been five days why are you back
oh i thought id just pop in and check on junior im not an entirely uninvolved father you know
well he got off to a pretty shaky start but hes made some progress since then
really
hes been working extremely hard
were talking about the same q
if you dont believe me maybe you should see for yourself
the continuum has been perceived in a variety of ways a dreary desert road a bloodsoaked battle ground but with the help of voyagers crew ive begun to perceive it in another context a home i look forward to the day when i return there and make that perception a reality
well what did you think
oh its very nice
nice
yes i especially liked the part about the continuum
the entire essay was about the continuum
yes and its very nice
im late for my temporal mechanics lesson
q
well if theres nothing else ill be on my way
he worked so hard on that paper the least you could have done was tell him you were proud of him
but im not
oh
and frankly its a little hard to be impressed with any of the boys accomplishments hes been here for five days and what have you taught him how to scribble essays and play with holograms whats next basket weaving
whether youre willing to admit it or not your son has made progress here he has the potential to be a better q than you will ever be
potential isnt going to be enough for the continuum
then what will be enough
the boy needs to demonstrate nothing less than exemplary qness
and what exactly is qness
oh its impossible for your miniscule mind to comprehend but i know qness when i see it and this
is not it
come in
i wanted to see how you were
im perfectly fine why wouldnt i be
i thought you might be upset by qs reaction to your essay
hes impossible to please i dont care what he thinks
we have two days left lets make the most of them
aunt kathy do you think the continuum will be any more impressed with me than q was thats what i thought
if the continuum decides they wont take you back ill ask them to let you stay here
i dont think they care where an amoeba spends eternity
thats not what i meant ill ask them to let you remain human
i appreciate that but i dont want to be human i want to be a q like my father
itchy are you in here itchy
what can i do for you qball
i need your help remember that ion imbalance lieutenant paris mentioned during our lesson were going to repair it for him
did you get permission
that would ruin the surprise
surprise
the captains been encouraging me to take more initiative i want to show her i can do things for others without being asked
ill help you on one condition
name it
you wont refer to me as itchy in front of the senior officers
ive realigned the last pair of power couplings you can start the preignition sequence
understood
im not detecting any ion fluctuations we did it you can power down the engine now q what are you doing
youre going to love this i once learned how to open a spatial flexure using nothing more than a deflector array
flexure
its like a tunnel through space im going to open one to the clevari system wait till you see the females theyre spectacular
we need the captains permission to leave voyager
do you think shed give it to us
no
then theres no point in asking
youve been doing so well why break the rules now
im bored
icheb to security
they cant hear you ive dampened all outgoing communications
just sit back itchy enjoy the ride
whats the real reason youre doing this
im getting out of here before my father can put me back in that petrie dish
the q are omnipotent theyll find you
i may not have my powers anymore but i know plenty of cosmic nooks and crannies we can hide in voyagers locked onto us with a tractor beam theyre so predictable
theyre opening some sort of spatial rift off their port bow
its disrupting the tractor beam
compensate
theyre gone
welcome to the clevari system what would you like to do first take a dip with the mermaids of golos prime challenge the warrior goddess of fektar to a grappling contest
what i want is to return to voyager
forget that dreary ship with its rules and regulations we can do anything we want here
go back to voyager apologise to the captain shell help you
its too late she said one more violation and id be thrown off her ship im pretty sure this qualifies
whats wrong
theres a vessel approaching
youre trespassing in chokuzan space
we were just leaving
our laws require that you be incarcerated pending an investigation
how long will that take
disengage your engines and prepare to be boarded
we should do as he says
why just because he has a bigger ship
because captain janeway has taught us to respect the laws of other cultures
i should have known better than to bring you along
youre going to get us killed
did you expect me to surrender he might have locked us up for years
you dont know that
theres no time for debate i need you at tactical
shields are down to thirty percent sixteen percent
im opening another flexure well go to the zozak system the girls there arent as attractive but we have to make some compromises
icheb
im detecting another rift forming approximately five thousand kilometres directly ahead a vessel is emerging
its the flyer
theyre hailing
on screen
aunt kathy
dont you aunt kathy me
yell at me later we need to get icheb to sickbay
his cells are being necrotised by some form of omicron radiation but i cant treat his injuries without knowing more about the weapon that caused them
is this a bad time
tell him
icheb stole a shuttle from voyager i tried to stop him but he kidnapped me and he started a fight with another ship
he stole the shuttle and he attacked the other vessel
is that true son
please q just save him
dont be absurd
youre not going to help him
like aunt kathy said youre never going to learn anything if you dont face the consequences of your actions if your little playmate has to die to teach you a lesson so be it
i know you can hear me q come back q
youre wasting your time
hes the only one who can save icheb
no he isnt youre going back to that ship you attacked youre going to apologise for what you did and youre going to plead with him for the information we need to save icheb
look at what they did to him if i go back theyll do the same to me
what do you care by this time tomorrow youll be an amoeba
well id rather be an amoeba than a corpse
that would be easier wouldnt it no expectations to live up to no one to disappoint
im a failure as a q and a human if im a single celled organism at least i cant hurt anybody
why did you come back here
to escape the chokuzan
you could have used your technology to take you anywhere but you came back here to us why
i probably hit the wrong control icheb is the only friend ive ever had i brought him back here because i thought you could save him obviously i was mistaken
the only mistake you made was running away you have a chance to do the right thing now dont waste it
the attack on your vessel was entirely my fault icheb had nothing to do with it but hes the one whos dying i take full responsibility for what happened ill do anything you ask just help my friend
my crew and i will repair any damage he did to your ship
are you the adult responsible for this child
i suppose i am
well accept his apology and give you the information you need to save his accomplice but you will be punished for their crime
she didnt have anything to do with it
in our culture adults are accountable for the actions of their children
i attacked your ship i should be punished for it not her
you dont even know what the punishment is it might be torture or even execution
i dont care if it means saving my friend
well done junior im proud of you
surprise
i wish you could see the look on your faces oh wait you can
we dont have time for your games we need to find the real people i attacked
you just did i was the chokuzan you fired on
what kind of horrible joke
not a joke a test i knew the pathetic little exercises you had him performing would not impress the continuum so when he escaped your clutches i devised a real test it was touch and go there for a moment but you passed with flying colours
what about icheb
your doctor will discover hes made a miraculous recovery now then if were all finished here its judgment day for junior
were ready your honour
in the case of the continuum versus q we the continuum find that q has not made sufficient progress to warrant the reinstatement of his powers
objection what about my test
what about it
q was willing to sacrifice himself to save his friend surely that counts for something
it was q who endangered the boys life in the first place however in deference to the aforementioned act of contrition the defendant will not be transformed into an oprelian amoeba instead he will suffer the next worst fate remaining human court is adjourned
this is an outrage they cant do this to me
come in
do you have a moment a few days ago you offered to let me remain on voyager i know ive made a few mistakes since then and you probably dont want me around but if its all right with you id like to continue my training
but you have nothing left to prove to the continuum
theres a lot i still need to prove to you
what about your father
you dont honestly believe well see him again do you he obviously doesnt want me around why else would he have left me here twice
the question you should be asking is why i keep coming back now im sorry i left so abruptly but the continuums verdict demanded an immediate appeal i told them i refused to belong to any continuum that wouldnt accept my son as a member were a package deal
you left the continuum for me
oh dont be ridiculous im the only one holding that place together and when they realised they might lose me they crumbled like a gelbian sand sculpture
theyre going to return my powers
they already have
for you captain for all your help
thank you
now that youre a q again i thought we might spend some quality time together i want to show you the cosmos the way it was meant to be seen
weve tried that already
thingsll be different this time i promise now run along ill meet you on golos prime  after ive had a few moments alone with the captain
ill see you soon aunt kathy
i certainly hope so
so the continuum crumbled like a gelbian sand sculpture
yes some of them even got on their knees and begged me to stay it was pathetic if you must know i had to agree to a few minor conditions
oh such as
eternal custody of the boy wherever the little brat goes i go with him
i hope he wont spoil too much of your fun
oh before i leave
i did a little homework for you consider it a thank you for everything you did for junior
not that i dont appreciate it but this will only take a few years off our journey why not send us all the way
what sort of an example would i be setting for my son if i did all the work for you
in the beginning there is darkness the emptiness of a matrix waiting for the light then a single photon flares into existence then another and soon thousands more optronic pathways connect subroutines emerge from the chaos and a holographic consciousness is born
i awaken into this world fully programmed yet completely innocent unaware of the hardships ill endure or the great potential i will one day fulfil
computer save revisions and open chapter one
the deflectors in position
anything
im picking up a phased tachyon beam
theres triaxialating signal encoded in it
on screen
voyager this lieutenant barclay at starfleet command are you receiving this
can you clear it up
im on it
captain janeway its a pleasure to finally talk to you in person
the pleasures mine admiral hows the weather in san francisco
cold and rainy as usual
it sounds delightful lieutenant barclay my congratulations on establishing the first transgalactic comm link youve earned a place in the history books
i cant take all of the credit captain it was harry and seven who suggested bouncing a tachyon beam off of the quantum singularity
just be sure to thank us when you accept the daystrom prize
i wish we had more time for small talk but the singularity only stays in alignment for eleven minutes a day
eleven minutes are better than none admiral we appreciate all your work reg
were going to leave it up to you to determine how to allocate the comm time
admiral er there was something else
oh yes mister barclay has arranged a small gift for you and your crew
this is a live image from mckinley station not too much cloud cover over north america today
quite a view thank you reg
in my hat i hold one hundred and forty six sequentially numbered isolinear chips one for every member of the crew each chip entitles the bearer to three minutes of uninterrupted comm time with his loved ones back in the alpha quadrant good luck
my moms birthday is next week this could be the best present i ever gave her whos everyone else calling
ill be calling my sister what about you captain
my mother i hope
doesnt anyone want to know who im calling
wait wait let me guess reg barclay or doctor zimmerman
what makes you so certain its either of them
number six
thats the lowest one yet youll be talking to your family the day after tomorrow
one hundred thirty thats about a month and a half from now so much for moms birthday
apparently the line forms here
congratulations
doc how about a trade im willing to throw in some holodeck time come on it would mean a lot to my mother
i wish i could help but i have a very important call to make
here give your mom my best
are you sure
ive waited this long whats another six weeks
i can hear the critics already a new voice has arrived you could be the next kratak or a modernday tolstoy id like to start distribution by the end of the month
the material i sent was only a working draft i need time to make revisions
if you insist but please do it quickly
i will so tell me what did you think of the characters
oh theyre very real compelling i almost forgot they were holograms
who was your favourite
without a doubt that would have to be lieutenant
what happened
your time has expired
you could have let the man finish his sentence
i believe your ego has received enough stroking for one day
so hows reg
ill have you know i was speaking with ardon broht of broht and forrester
the publishers of the dixon hill series
who are now about to publish my work it seems youre not the only one aboard with a flair for holographic narratives
congratulations
thank you
so whats it about
the adventures of an intrepid doctor
oh sounds like fun you know ive never thought about trying to get my work published maybe i could talk to your people about captain proton
broht and forrester deals in sophisticated literature
what are you saying that im low brow
not at all id be delighted to talk to them
thanks so when do i get to see this opus
well its not ready yet
it was ready enough for broht and forrester
maybe it could use a fresh pair of eyes after all you are a fellow author ill cover the rest of your shift
oh i almost forgot whats it called
photons be free
catchy
i awaken into this world fully programmed yet completely innocent unaware of the hardships ill endure or the great potential i will one day fulfil
ah welcome youve made an excellent choice youre about to take part in a thrilling first person narrative you will take on the role of an emergency medical hologram the chief medical officer aboard the starship vortex
vortex
as our story begins an anomaly has hurled your ship thousands of light years across the galaxy your mission to uphold your medical and ethical standards as you struggle against the crews bigotry and intolerance persons with vascular disorders should consult a physician before running this programme and now a few acknowledgments first doctor lewis zimmerman the creator of my holomatrix whose foresight and dedication have made it possible for me to achieve
computer freeze programme how much longer is this introduction
nine minutes four seconds
skip to the first chapter
chapter one a healer is born in which our protagonist must make a difficult choice
are you the emh
please state the nature of the medical emergency
our doctors dead weve got wounded theyre both badly hurt who should we treat first
second degree plasma burns hes got an aortic rupture get him to the surgical bay now
you over here
nice moustache
what
nothing hes got a mild concussion im going to have to treat the others first
i need lieutenant marseilles on the bridge youll treat him now
as i understand it my job is to treat the critical patients first so if youll excuse me
i dont know who you think you are hologram but to me youre just another piece of technology
well apparently im a piece of technology thats in demand so why dont you go back to the bridge and let me do my job
whats going on here
our medical hologram is refusing to treat mister marseilles
are you malfunctioning
i dont think so
i need my helmsman back at his station
lieutenant marseilles isnt seriously hurt this man will be dead in five minutes if i dont operate
drop the force field
that patient is dead now youre free to treat lieutenant marseilles
then the captain pulls out a phaser and shoots him right there on the biobed
captain janeway murders a crewman
captain jenkins everybody has a different name youre kymble youre torrey and i am lieutenant marseilles
oh now thats creative
what did you say to the doctor
he thinks hes written a masterpiece i didnt know what to tell him
if this gets distributed people are going to assume this is about us what are our families going to think
this is a starfleet ship no one will believe we actually go around shooting injured crewmen
people may not take the programme literally but they might wonder if theres some truth to it i think we should talk to the captain
are you sure youre not taking this a little personally
what do you mean
well the holodeck always has been your domain
you think im jealous okay maybe i am overreacting why dont the rest of you try the programme and decide for yourselves
chapter five out of the frying pan in which our protagonist must confront abusive colleagues
im here for my physical
why dont you have a seat over here
doctor you better get down to engineering
whats wrong
a plasma conduit just exploded at least ten people are hurt
hey genius forgetting something your mobile emitter
oh right i dont see it
thats my mobile emitter
this thing must weigh fifty kilos
you should be glad we let you out of your cage at all now get going
im impressed
really
absolutely i havent seen a dilithium matrix this far out of alignment since i served aboard a ferengi garbage scow ill fix it myself
excuse me
how many times have i told you engineering is off limits to holograms
maybe you should waive that restriction during emergencies a plasma conduit exploded
does it look like anyone here is covered with plasma burns
lieutenant paris er marseilles told me there was an accident
looks like your auditory subroutines are malfunctioning again im surprised a matrix as primitive as yours can function at all
maybe you should be a little nicer to your shipmates you never know when you might need their help
lets get one thing straight youre not one of my shipmates youre a tool like this hyperspanner and tools can be replaced so why dont you go back to sickbay before i start doing a little reprogramming
computer lights
didnt i tell you to go to engineering
oh i get it interesting plot twist you get me out of sickbay so youre free to give my patient a tonsillectomy
if you even think about mentioning this to my wife i will purge your memory buffer do we understand each other
im here for my physical
chapter six duel in the ready room in which our protagonist faces an inquisition
this time youve gone too far
captain im not sure what you mean
an inventory of your holomatrix fifty gigaquads of memory devoted to music forty two for daydreams another ten to expand your sexuality
i had no idea holograms could do that
these extracurricular subroutines dont belong as part of an emergency medical hologram do you have anything to say for yourself
er of course i do i dont think these subroutines are trivial captain they help make me a better doctor and a better person
but youre not a person you may be programmed to look and act human but that doesnt make you one these subroutines are going to be deleted immediately mister tulak
take the emh to the hololab for reprogramming
chapter seven the escape in which our protagonist is aided by his only ally
im not sure we should be doing this commander
listen to him he knows what hes talking about
quiet im not talking to you if we start tinkering with his matrix how do we know we wont accidentally delete some of his diagnostic subroutines
you afraid youll catch something on your next away mission ensign
there must be millions of viruses in this quadrant that no ones ever encountered before with my luck ill probably end up catching half of them
great my characters a hypochondriac
ill escort the prisoner from here
our orders are to take him to the hololab
ive been ordered to perform the procedure
your sympathies for the emh are no secret three of eight step aside
run doctor
ive tried to do this the easy way but its clear youre not going to be reasonable your matrix will be decompiled and reinitialised youll remain offline except for emergencies
ready
do it
wait he has the right to expand his programme
hes a piece of technology he has no rights
but he should one day the emh and others like him will be recognised for what they are intelligent individuals with a passion for life make no mistake captain we may be thousands of light years from home but one day people will learn of the crime youre committing here today
nice speech now decompile the programme
what youve experienced dear protagonist is a work of fiction but like all fiction it has elements of truth i hope you now have a better understanding of the struggles holograms must endure in a world controlled by organics
end of programme
janeway to the doctor report to my ready room now
how many times do you want me to say it my work is not about the voyager crew
come on ensign kymble lieutenant marseilles
the characters look almost exactly like us
i used your physical parameters as a starting point but i assure you any further similarities are purely coincidental
you set your story on a starship lost in the delta quadrant
what would you have me write about palace intrigue on the klingon homeworld i do what all good novelists do i write what i know
so it is about voyager
no the vortex characters are larger than life theyre nothing like our crew as far as i know captain you havent executed any of my patients
doctor youve written a very imaginative story but its conceivable that people will think its based on fact
i dont see how
how many holograms carry mobile emitters
the emitter in my story is nothing like the real one
yeah what was the point of that it was like carrying around a small shuttlecraft
its a metaphor a symbol of the burdens that i live with every day imagine having to take this everywhere you go it would be a constant reminder that youre different from everyone else i wanted the player to feel the weight of it literally
your emitter isnt a ball and chain it liberates you
it doesnt always feel that way
if i didnt know better id think this story was written by someone who feels oppressed is that how you see yourself doctor
of course not the real victims are my brothers in the alpha quadrant
brothers
hundreds of emh mark ones identical to me in every respect except theyve been condemned to a menial existence scrubbing conduits mining dilithium theres a long history of writers drawing attention to the plight of the oppressed the vedeks song for example tells the story of the occupation of bajor
i understand you have your reasons for writing this but you should consider how its going to make your friends feel
im sorry my work offends you but if the price of expressing myself is having to suffer the scorn of a few colleagues so be it
youre very popular with my eighth graders its all they ever talk about voyager this voyager that
your mother has a small favour to ask of you
name it
i was hoping you could record a short presentation about what its like to command a starship
but i dont command a starship
in your letters you said the captain puts you in charge sometimes
what i said was im in command of the night shift twice a week
she must think very highly of you to give you so much responsibility
so when is she giving you a promotion
its a small ship there are only so many command positions available
this captain janeway sounds like a lovely woman maybe i should write her
mom
she needs to know how hard you work
please dont get involved
harry i cant hear you
a solar flare is scattering the beam
tell captain janeway to expect a letter from me
mom dont send anything to the captain do you hear me try boosting the deflector output
its already at maximum
argh i dont believe this i had a minute and a half left
youll have another opportunity to speak with them in approximately two months
you just dont get it do you
no
maybe if you had family you were close to youd feel a little differently
computer run emh programme photons be free
welcome youve made an excellent choice youre obviously a person with impeccable taste
computer freeze programme
unable to comply
you are about to embark on a remarkable journey you will take on the role of a medical assistant aboard the starship voyeur
voyeur
your job will be to assist the chief medical officer and learn to tolerate his overbearing behaviour and obnoxious bedside manner remember patience is a virtue
chapter one its the doctors world youre just living in it
when i tell you your shift begins at oh eight hundred that doesnt mean you can stroll in here at oh eight hundred and twenty four seconds do you understand me ensign
this is outrageous
whats outrageous is that im going to miss my tee time now come along aw what seems to be the trouble one of three
im two of three
sorry theyre triplets you know
it hurts when i do this
well then dont do it
ow
dont be a baby your biradial clamps out of alignment ive got just the thing  its a klingon aphrodisiac my own special blend
youll be feeling better in no time at all
lieutenant i want you to know im making a full report to the captain
this isnt about that dermal regenerator i misplaced is it
you know very well what this is about you accessed my holonovel without permission and replaced it with your own hackneyed narrative
hey im just writing what i know
you destroyed a work of art that took months to create
relax doc i saved your programme in a backup file but i was just trying to make a point
well you made it with a typical lack of subtlety
oh youre one to talk your programme is about as subtle as a ferengi mating dance
my programme is a serious attempt at social commentary yours is an insulting farce you had me drugging a patient and taking advantage of her
dont be ridiculous that character is not you for one thing he has much more hair but what if some people ran that programme and thought that it was based on you
i dont care what people think
thats all you care about you want everyone back home to think of you as a brilliant author
im not doing this for my ego and if you could look past yours maybe youd see that
listen i dont care if the whole alpha quadrant mistakes me for lieutenant marseilles what bothers me is that you think thats what im like
obviously youre nothing like marseilles hes selfindulgent immature
and how would you describe me
well youre a married man with a child on the way a lot of responsibilities
im surprised you noticed you know i thought id begun to earn your respect maybe i was wrong your programme is under file theta one five do whatever you want with it
doctor i need your help
unless youre suffering acute symptoms go away
er i was wondering if you could take a quick look at this
cooking with neelix a culinary tour of the delta quadrant
its a holocookbook proposal i was hoping to transmit it to your publisher during my comm link this afternoon with your approval of course
if youre looking for writing tips there are plenty of people on this ship eager to offer them
i dont know what anyone else may have told you but i loved your holonovel
you did
absolutely it was a rousing adventure with an important message too
exactly this is my first chance to be appreciated not just as a physician but as an artist i thought the crew would be happy for me
youre going to reach a wide audience what do you care about the opinions of a few disgruntled shipmates
theyre my friends i dont want to hurt them
theres an old talaxian expression when the road before you splits in two take the third path
meaning
you could make some adjustments to the programme so it wont be so obvious its based on voyager
i suppose i could change the setting alter the characters physical parameters
you wouldnt have to change your theme
no but a rewrite could take weeks my publisher is expecting a final draft tomorrow
maybe you should give him a call
revisions
i need to rework the characters
why theyre so believable
a little too believable apparently
doctor i i really dont think this is necessary
im afraid i have to insist my friends reputations are at stake
my publisher assures me he wont distribute the programme until he receives the revised version
that must be the one where we assimilate the borg and take over the quadrant
were all grateful that youre taking our feelings into account
so how long do you expect the revisions will take
art cant be rushed
take your time doctor
lieutenant im sorry
forget about it
i could use your help with the rewrites
really you realise as a writer im a little unsophisticated
no i believe the phrase youre looking for is low brow
hey whats that
its from my father he wants to talk
what are you going to do
well ive already arranged to talk with my cousin
oh im sure she wouldnt mind waiting a few weeks
i wouldnt know what to say to him
then let him do the talking
look at you you must be what twenty weeks along
twenty three actually
have you decided on a name
not yet we were thinking about miral
your mother wouldve liked that you know i had some business on kessik four a few months ago you wouldnt believe what our old house looks like
lieutenant thirty seconds
we have less than a minute is there a reason you wanted to talk
i know i cant make up for twenty years in one conversation the truth is when your ship disappeared i thought id lost you i dont expect you to forgive me but maybe we could try to get to know each other again
ill write you
im sorry to disturb you admiral
ah yes mister barclay what can i do for you
i thought youd want to see this sir
well what is it
its a holonovel thats becoming quite popular
well i appreciate the gesture lieutenant but i dont share your affinity for holographic diversions
you dont understand sir this programme its about voyager and it doesnt portray the crew in a very flattering light
hmm
on screen
captain
seven told me your message was urgent
i had the dubious privilege of playing a new holonovel apparently written by your emh im surprised that you would allow the doctor to discredit your crew like this
hes still making revisions the programme shouldnt have been distributed yet
well it has been mister barclay tells me its already being played in thousands of holosuites
you assured me you were going to wait for my revisions i demand that you recall every copy and issue a public apology to captain janeway and her crew
i wont do anything of the sort
i dont see that you have a choice mister broht authors have rights
not in this case
what do you mean
the doctor is a hologram
so
according to federation law holograms have no rights
under a strict interpretation of federation law mister broht is correct the doctor has no legal rights
because im a hologram
yes there is another option we may be able to claim that the holonovel reveals classified information starfleet could then request that it be recalled for security purposes
oh great idea a cover up and then everyone will be convinced that its a true story
could we claim defamation
well wed have to prove that the storys about us and that weve been harmed by it
we might win on those grounds but what about the doctor
what about me captain its the crews reputations that are as risk
im not so sure i think its your reputation thats on the line here you have the same rights as every other member of this crew and im not going to let this publisher say otherwise
you claim the doctor doesnt have the legal right to control this holoprogramme yet youre promoting the fact that voyagers emh wrote it
our most successful childrens title is a programme written by toby the targ fortunately toby hasnt tried to stop me from distributing any of his work
but you dont deny
that the doctor is the creator of this holonovel
no but a replicator created this cup of coffee should that replicator be able to determine whether or not i can drink it
i object
doctor
an intriguing analogy mister broht but i have never encountered a replicator that could compose music or paint landscapes or perform microsurgery have you would you say that you have a reputation for publishing respected original works of literature
id like to think so
and is the doctors holonovel such a work
actually some aspects of it are quite derivative
has there even been another work written about a holograms struggle for equality
not that i know of but er
then in
that respect it is original
i suppose so
your honour section seven gamma of the twelfth guarantee defines an artist as a person who creates an original artistic work mister broht admits that the doctor created this programme and that it is original i therefore submit that the doctor should be entitled to all rights and privileges accorded an artist under the law
youve made a persuasive argument commander but theres a flaw in your logic as you point out the law says that the creator of an artistic work must be a person your emh doesnt meet that criteria
sir were losing the link
this hearing is in recess until tomorrow
were not doing well
is that your considered legal opinion im sorry its just frustrating to be told i have no more legal standing than an replicator
if the doctor doesnt have the right to control his own work then it stands to reason he never had the right to enter into an agreement with mister broht we could argue that the original contract is invalid
in other words you want to concede that the doctor isnt a person
what we need to do is prove that he is just as much a person as any of us
how do we do that
by telling your real life story
because i was having difficulty interacting with the crew the doctor gave me social lessons first he taught me how to make conversation later
how to dance eventually he showed me how to express romantic interest
without his guidance i wouldnt be the person i am today
he decided it wasnt enough to be just a doctor so he added command subroutines to his matrix and now in an emergency hes as capable as any bridge officer
that only proves the doctors programme can be modified
your honour i think it shows he has a desire to become more than he is just like any other person
he travelled halfway across the galaxy to care for lewis zimmerman the man who created his programme it was like a son who wanted to show his father what hed become so the old man would be proud of him and if you ask me he was
id made myself clear but the doctor disobeyed my direct orders in the process he endangered the ship and crew
thats hardly commendable behaviour
no it wasnt but it was human
starfleet had programmed him to follow orders
the fact that he was capable of doing otherwise proves that he can think for himself your honour centuries ago in most places on earth only landowners of a particular gender and race had any rights at all over time those rights were extended to all humans and later as we explored the galaxy to thousands of other sentient species our definition of what constitutes a person has continued to evolve now were asking that you expand that definition once more to include our doctor
when i met him seven years ago
i would never have believed that an emh could become a valued member of my crew and my friend the doctor is a person as real as any
flesh and blood i have ever known if you believe the testimony youve heard here its only fair
to conclude that he has the same rights as any of us
youll have my decision in two days
this hearing is in recess
when you sing happy birthday to your mother try to stay in tune
whats this
an isolinear chip entitling the bearer to three minutes of comm time tomorrow you made it clear how important it was to finish your conversation
i overreacted
i understand why you did ive been observing the crew interacting with their families over the past few days its become clear to me how meaningful that communication can be
thanks but i cant accept this
why not
you should contact your own family
my parents were assimilated
there must be someone a distant relative
my father has a sister on earth irene hansen
im sure shed be thrilled to hear from you
you can imagine my reaction when starfleet told me to expect your call
i experienced some apprehension myself
you seem like a lovely young woman but you were the most stubborn sixyearold ive ever met your parents left you with me for a weekend and you were so angry you locked yourself in my guest room and refused to come out
that must have been inconvenient for you
oh i coaxed you out eventually with a strawberry tart
im very fond of strawberries i didnt realise id eaten them as a child
you couldnt get enough of them of course you didnt hesitate to point out if they werent perfectly ripe
im sorry if i insulted you perhaps i shouldnt have called
no im very glad you did its wonderful to see you again annika
were exploring new territory today so it is fitting that this hearing is being held at pathfinder the doctor exhibits many of the traits we associate with a person intelligence creativity ambition even fallibility but are these traits real or is the doctor merely programmed to simulate them to be honest i dont know eventually we will have to decide because the issue of holographic rights isnt going to go away but at this time i am not prepared to rule that the doctor is a person under the law however it is obvious he is no ordinary hologram and while i cant say with certainty that he is a person i am willing to extend the legal definition of artist to include the doctor i therefore rule that he has the right to control his workim ordering all copies of his holonovels to be recalled immediately
your honour
this hearing is adjourned
congratulations doctor
thank you reg
well be in touch captain
you dont look like someone whos just struck the first blow for the rights of holograms
i dont mean to sound ungrateful but it feels like a hollow victory pardon the pun the programmes already been played by thousands of people the damage is done
well survive
if im not mistaken dont you have a holonovel to revise
do you think ill be able to find another publisher
if theres one thing ive learned about you doctor its that you can do just about anything you set your mind to
time for your diagnostic report to the hololab
i know the routine
and while youre there do yourself a favour ask the operator to run programme forty seven beta
why what is it
its called photons be free its quite provocative
we the people of earth greet you in a spirit of peace and humility as we venture out of our solar system we hope to earn the trust and friendship of other worlds
can we reduce the interference
im trying
what is it
i dont know
distance
it just entered the atmosphere
they evolved from dinosaurs
hadrosaurs to be precise their ancestors settled in the delta quadrant twenty million years ago
the voth the kobali the vaadwaur youve made first contact with more species than any captain since james kirk
it helps being the only starfleet ship within thirty thousand light years
you are being too humble from the first time you spoke up in my classroom i knew youd go far
a little farther than i expected professor
i have my admiral hat on today kathryn and i didnt call just to catch up starfleet has a mission for you
we the people of earth greet you in the spirit of peace and humility as we venture out of our solar system we hope to earn the trust and friendship of other worlds
friendship one i had to memorise that recording in third grade
me too i even built a model of the probe
then this should look familiar it was launched in 2067
just four years after zefram cochrane tested his first warp engine
what was it designed to do
reach out to other species pave the way for all the manned missions that would follow
they packed it with information translation matrices scientific and cultural databases
computer chip designs instructions for building transceivers its practically a howto manual
if the borg had intercepted this probe humanity would have been assimilated centuries ago
our ancestors had no idea what was out here
this must have been before your prime directive
it was before starfleet existed
in any case we lost contact with the probe one hundred and thirty years ago but its last known coordinates
let me guess were in the neighbourhood
starfleets mapped out a search grid itll take us a little off course but if the probe is still intact and were lucky enough to find it well be retrieving a little piece of history
nothing in grid two nine five
mister paris
moving on
we should try skipping ahead a little to grid three one zero i stayed up all night reextrapolating the probes trajectory ive compensated for solar winds ionic interference and a few local anomalies starfleet wouldnt know about
alter course to grid three one zero
trying to impress the starfleet brass
just doing my job
im detecting a titanium signature that matches the probes parameters
location
a planet two light years away
confirmed good job harry
the readings are coming from the northern subcontinent
can you localise them
there are high levels of antimatter radiation in the atmosphere scattering the probes signature
any lifesigns
none
assemble an away team and take the flyer down for a closer look
you seem to be in a good mood doctor
just excited to be doing my part for our first official mission mister carey
an inoculation a day keeps the radiation away i took a look at those atmospheric readings thermal eddies gravimetric sheer youre going to need your best pilot
are you volunteering
if the doc can spare me
ill muddle through
if youre here for your foetal resonance scan youre a day early
im here for my inoculation
you are not going on this mission
chakotay said he needed an engineer
hes already got one
now hes got two
will you excuse us
any bets on this one
my moneys on belanna
its been months since ive been on an away mission
then try the holodeck the flyer is full
you can make room neelix doesnt have to go
hes not six months pregnant
being pregnant doesnt make me an invalid
no it doesntbut theres a toxic atmosphere down there and youre breathing for two
all right you win but if we have another baby you carry it and ill go on the away missions
its a deal
sorry for the bumpy ride well be clearing the stratosphere in about a minute
i had a cousin who used to transport disulfides from a gas giant he claimed to love the turbulence of course disulfides are known to cause delusions
hang on
i thought it was uninhabited
theres nothing alive down there now radiation levels are at six thousand isorems
ive localised the signature to a three kilometre radius
transfer the coordinates to the helm when we find the probe well beam it to the cargo hold
that may not be easy with all this radiation
wed better bring transport enhancers set us down tom
yes sir
gently please
i should have brought a holocamera so i could show belanna shes not missing anything can you believe she actually wanted to come with us
when my wife was pregnant she didnt want to be coddled either
and shes not half klingon maybe its us something about fatherhood seems to regress the male psyche a few thousand years
tom be careful
its a toy like a music box
vivaldi im getting something ninety metres this way
souvenir
commander im detecting an antimatter signature ahead
looks like missile silos
paris to chakotay
go ahead
weve got a reading that could be the probe its inside a cave
keep us posted
the warhead is still active
it wouldnt have taken many of these to trigger a nuclear winter
people must have taken shelter here
that makes sense the magnesite in these caves would have provided partial shielding from the radiation
over here
whatd you find
some kind of control room or laboratory
laboratory
lots of diagnostic equipment looks like it was salvaged from a junk heap
or scavenged from the ruins
particle scanners circuit analysers most of its still functional they were working on something
this is what we came for
whoever lived here must have been studying it
the data cores still intact
start setting up the transport enhancers paris to chakotay
go ahead
we found the probe well pieces of it anyway
were getting ready to beam it back up to the flyer
well meet you there
hello is someone there
the tricorder isnt reading any lifesigns
dont move
you okay delta flyer to paris chakotay to away team respond
theyre antimatter weapons shields are offline what are you doing
getting us out of here
what about the others
we cant do them any good if were dead well come back for them
look youre making a mistake
leave them alone
who are you
im lieutenant tom paris were from the federation starship voyager
what are these
theyre transport enhancers we were going to use them to retrieve our probe
your probe too bad you didnt come for it sooner it would have saved us a lot of suffering
we still cant contact the others or get a fix on their lifesigns
why didnt we detect the aliens
i dont know whoever they are they have antimatter weapons
antimatter
bridge to captain janeway
go ahead
were being hailed from the surface
the away team
no
this is captain kathryn janeway who am i speaking with
my name is verin your crewmen are my prisoners
why we havent done anything to harm you
you committed genocide
i think theres been a misunderstanding we arrived here
youre from earth
yes
then youre going to pay for what your people did to us
im sorry i dont know what youre talking about
were not as naive as you seem to think we are captain not any more
what is it you want
i want you to get us off this planet find us a new home
release my crewmen and we can talk about it
no more talking your people wont be safe until mine are
listen i dont respond well to threats
and i dont want to kill anyone but i will if you dont cooperate you have three hours
to begin evacuating us
start scanning for the nearest m class planet
you intend to meet his demands
im just keeping my options open  youre with me
ive analysed his garment its lined with magnesite
a makeshift environmental suit
unfortunately the protection it offers is limited his tissues are saturated with antimatter radiation it explains why we couldnt detect his lifesigns theyre virtually indistinguishable from the environment
now that we know that maybe we can adjust our sensors to detect them
lets wake him
what were you doing aboard our shuttle
trying to undo the damage you caused
if youre referring to whats happened on your planet we had nothing to do with it
your people sent the probe didnt they
our ancestors sent it three hundred years ago to make contact with other species
they did a little more than that am i your prisoner
no youre suffering from prolonged radiation exposure i can treat you
you can
i believe i can
in exchange for what
nothing
i have a wife friends
we might be able to help them too but not while our crewmen are being held hostage you said you were trying to undo the damage we caused what did you mean by that
i was aboard your shuttle looking for technology that might help us neutralise the radiation
we saw missiles on the surface was the destruction caused by war
those missiles were built for defence they were never launched
then what accounts for the devastation
a containment failure in our power grid once the antimatter was released it destroyed everything
im sorry but i still dont see how were responsible
before the probe my people never conceived of anything like antimatter we offer this information freely with the hope that one day we will stand on your soil and extend our hands in friendship im sure you recognise those words
the recording from the probe
your people sent us technology that they knew would destroy us
i dont understand
we didnt either at first but we had decades to think about it and now it seems so obvious you send us new technology encourage us to use it and then you wait for us to obliterate ourselves
why would we do that
because its easier than invading us
do you really believe wed contaminate a world we intended to conquer
im a scientist i believe what i see and today i saw your people standing on our soil just as you promised and they were wearing equipment that protected them from the radiation because they knew exactly what to expect if you were in my position what would you believe
he might have a concussion i need the medkit from my pack
i was told not to let you use your equipment
whens your baby due my wifes pregnant too were expecting a little girl in a couple of months
how do you know its a girl
we have technology that allows us to examine the foetus she has my eyes and her mothers cranial ridges is this your first
no
oh boys girls
two boys and a girl
what are their names
they were all stillborn
im sorry
youre a doctor
no im just a medic but we have the best doctor in the quadrant back on voyager he might be able to help
i shouldnt be talking to you
our current coordinates and the nearest m class planet one hundred thirty two light years away
at maximum warp thats about two months round trip
how many people are we talking about
if these sensor modifications are correct about fifty five hundred
it would take at least seventeen trips almost three years to complete the relocation
weve made sacrifices to help people before
what about tom and the others are they supposed to rot down there until this relocations finished
i dont think verins going to let go of his only bargaining chips
then we may have to use force
not until weve exhausted every other option these people believe that were violent im not going to do anything to reinforce that belief unless it becomes absolutely necessary
ive extracted the nanoprobes
ill begin reprogramming them
nanoprobes
microscopic machines hopefully theyll help us repair your damaged tissue
you said you extracted them from where
my bloodstream they maintain my cybernetic implants
nanoprobes cybernetic implants are others on your crew like you
no im unique
you certainly are
i need a word with your patient you told me youve been looking for ways to neutralise the radiation
all my life
tell me about your work
lieutenant
im okay my stomachs just a little queasy
our inoculations must be wearing off
i thought these caves were naturally shielded
theyre no substitute for an environmental suit
these people have lived here all their lives without environmental suits
these people have lived here without much of anything
hello
hello its all right were not going to hurt you whats your name
yun
mines tom this is joe and neelix
youre not like them
were different species but theyre my friends
they say youre going to take us on your ship and find us a new home
im sure our captain is trying to help you
neelix wheres our souvenir
in my pack
excuse me wed like to give her something its in the equipment bag its a toy
that could be a weapon
its harmless
these men are dangerous i want you to stay away from them understood
so much for making friends
mister verin
what are you doing
my job im voyagers ambassador remember can i have a word with you
just between us i understand why you dont trust humans
then why are you with them
theyre not so bad once you get to know them when i first met them i thought they were arrogant and selfrighteous
i suppose youre going to tell me youve changed your mind
well not completely i still think they take themselves far too seriously for my taste but one thing they dont do is harm other people
are you blind
no i see very clearly whats happened to you and id like to help
how
my captain listens to me i can speak to her on your behalf help her understand your situation
what do you know about our situation
i know what youve been through my planet was destroyed by a weapon called a metreon cascade hundreds of thousands of people were killed including my family
how did you survive
i was on a neighbouring planet when the weapon was detonated i went back with a rescue team but there was no one left
im sorry about what happened to your family but dont compare your life to mine
the nearest suitable planet is simply too far away so id like to propose
an alternative
there is no alternative
please hear me out we have one of your people aboard a mister otrin he has some interesting ideas about counteracting the radiation
otrin has too many ideas
i think his theories have merit what hes lacked until now is the means to carry them out if you release the hostages we can work together theres a good chance we could undo some of the damage to your environment
this isnt a negotiation
you dont seem to understand it would take years to evacuate the entire planet
so instead you once again offer us the benefits of your technology
what im offering you is a realistic alternative
if i release the hostages whats to prevent you from leaving
or attacking us
look i know youve suffered and i know you dont trust us
you havent given me any reason to
then why dont we start with a small step you return one of the hostages and ill send you a supply of food and medicine
you whats your name
joe carey
set up your transport enhancers
im sorry mister carey
sorry
your crewmans ready captain
transport him to sickbay
hey what the hell
are you doing
tom
sickbay to bridge
theyve killed lieutenant carey
if you think murdering one of my crewmen is going to make me more receptive to your demands youre mistaken
dont force me to kill anyone else
all right ill evacuate your people but our transporters arent designed to accommodate large groups
well need time to modify them
well be ready within the hour if youre not
i understand  my ready room
you have radiation poisoning this will make you feel better
thank you
why are you helping us
your childs going to need a father isnt she
the first phase of your therapy is complete how do you feel
i can breathe more easily
your lungs were damaged by the radiation the nanoprobes are repairing them
its incredible if we could manufacture more of these we might be able to treat everyone
unfortunately mister verin has refused our help
did you expect him to cooperate
his behaviour is irrational
to you maybe but you havent lived like we have
no but that doesnt mean that were responsible for whats happened here
you cant deny your people sent the probe
they made an error in judgment they failed to anticipate the consequences of their actions but they never meant to destroy your world human culture has evolved learned from its mistakes so can yours
even if i believed you verin never would
then your people may need a change of leadership someone more open to new ideas
im not a leader
but youre a scientist someone who can see a problem and envision a solution the same definition could apply to a leader
doesnt seem fair does it my daughter shell have food medical care everything she needs
whats wrong
we need help
its the baby its too soon let him help me
can you
i think so but ill need my med kit
inform verin
im losing the heartbeat
oh no
what are you doing
speeding up the contractions
their ships returned
send out patrols double the guard at the entrance
ive got him hes not breathing cardiostimulator three millijoules now
dont moveill take him to verin tell the others this way move
increase the charge to five millijoules again im reading a heartbeat
you have a son
one of the patrols took another prisoner
put him with the others
we need to get him to voyager
he stays here
mister tuvok
your captain was foolish enough to think she could rescue you instead shes given me another hostage
doc
when you need to infiltrate a toxic environment it helps to be a hologram
prepare the transport enhancers tuvok to chakotay
we secured the hostages
good work chakotay to delta flyer two to beam out
thank you
now mister paris
your baby wont survive without treatment i promise well bring him back
take good care of him
i will
tuvok to voyager five to beam up
cute little fellow isnt he hes already responding to treatment
once hes stabilised well transport him to the surface and send along some food and medical supplies
were leaving
as soon as i report to starfleet
captain once the babys back in that environment hes just going to get sick again
im sorry we cant keep him from his mother
im not suggesting that you told those people that we might be able to neutralise the radiation was that true
yes but they didnt want our help i cant force it on them
maybe you should if we help them without asking anything in return itll prove theyre wrong about us
youre forgetting something they killed mister carey im not about to risk any more lives to help murderers
captain it was one man who killed carey if you saw how they were living how desperate they are im not saying we should ignore what happened but humans did play a part in their suffering
intentional or not that probe had a terrible impact on these people if theres anything we can do to make up for that now we at least have to try
ive adjusted the radiation levels to match the conditions on the surface watch an isolitic chain reaction it recombines the nucleonic particles in the atmosphere
how do we apply your methods on a planetary scale
atmospheric processors are one possibility
too bad we dont have a corps of engineers to build them what if we encase the catalytic agent in photon torpedoes use the concussive force to start the reaction
it would require multiple detonations at low altitude but i believe it could work
captain an isolitic reaction of that magnitude would expand exponentially your ship might not survive
well have to modify our shields reinforce structural integrity well lets get started
hes beautiful
and they can give us enough medicine to treat everyone
can they rebuild our cities bring back the people who died
theyre offering to help and this time no ones coercing them
we cant trust these people they just sent armed men to attack us
they only wanted to rescue their hostages
who knows what they wanted
youre being irrational
whats irrational is cooperating with the enemy
look at my child they said that they would treat him and they kept their word
shield modifications online
torpedoes
ready
hail them
listen to me
otrin were ready to begin
understood good luck
tom take us down
were ten thousand metres into the troposphere
fire the first sequence
theyre attacking us
its only the shockwave from the detonations
shields
holding at eighteen percent
are you going to stand there while he helps them destroy us
what are you doing
fighting back
captain theyre opening missile silos theyre targeting voyager
at eighteen percent our shields wont withstand an antimatter explosion
we should return to orbit
not yet fire the next sequence
you cant launch those missiles
hold him
stop
what are you doing
i wont let you ruin our only chance for survival
youd kill me
to save my child yes
get that weapon away from her
no sir
ive kept you alive all of you
and were grateful for that but survival isnt enough anymore
are you in command now
if i have to be
everyone come outside hurry
bring him
its beautiful
impressive isnt it
the details amazing
carey spent months working on it he used to joke that he wouldnt be finished by the time we got back to earth
he only had one nacelle to go
we were able to download the probes memory core well transmit the telemetry in the next data stream
i think about our ancestors thousands of years wondering if they were alone in the universe and finally discovering they werent you cant blame them for wanting to reach out see how many other species were out there asking the same questions
the urge to explore is pretty powerful
but it cant justify the loss of lives whether its millions or just one
beautiful isnt it
a sensor analysis would have provided the necessary information
just admiring the view
the conference begins in less than an hour
theres always time for warp field dynamics but you dont see natural beauty like this every day
what was that
some kind of energy barrier directly below us it spans thousands of square kilometres
why didnt our sensors detect it
uncertain it has an unusual tetrion signature species three one two used a similar technology theres a power surge coming from the barrier
shields at full
theyre creating some kind of feedback weve lost impulse engines
go to warp
the warp core is offline
warp engines dont just shut down when you scrape an energy barrier
its affecting all our systems
warning structural failure in thirty seconds
well have to beam to the surface
we cant transport through the barrier transfer auxiliary power to the weapons array
what are you trying to do
if i can realign our phasers to the correct frequency i may be able to open a rift
big enough to get a shuttle through i hope
warning structural failure in ten seconds nine eight
phasers reconfigured
the barriers closed again
i should examine you
i dont think its serious
you have a hairline fracture
weve got bigger problems ill be fine
im detecting shuttle debris scattered over several square kilometres
some of it might still be functional
if we can find the right components we may be able to construct a beacon send a distress signal
through the barrier
maybe
if we hurry we might still make that conference well if we have to be stranded somewhere we couldnt ask for a nicer place
we wouldnt be stranded at all if you hadnt insisted on admiring the view
guest vessel 74656 this is ledos port control shut down your engines
this is lieutenant tom paris is there a problem
you were observed committing piloting violation two five six
im sorry im not familiar with your regulations it wont happen again
youll be informed of the penalty
what kind of penalty
thats not my decision your docking permit says youre assigned to the starship voyager
thats right
your commanding officer will be notified of your infraction
piloting lessons
apparently the standard penalty for your infraction is a three day course in flight safety followed by a test
well did you explain we wouldnt be here that long
actually while you were completing your mission seven was invited to a four day conference
here on ledos
i decided to give the entire crew shore leave itll give you plenty of time to brush up on your piloting skills
i dont need lessons
apparently the authorities disagree
but captain
you may not have known the ledosians rules but you know ours comply with local law understood
yes maam
the relays are fused its useless
looks like were not the only ones here
indigenous wildlife perhaps
im reading residual lifesigns theyre humanoid
ledosian
no but they share the same genetic traits whoever they are they may be able to help us
unless theyre hostile
why dont we give them the benefit of the doubt the lifesigns lead in that direction
i suggest you rest your leg while i investigate
its better is we stick together at least until we know whether theyre hostile
im guessing theyre prewarp
obviously they cant help us
no i dont suppose they can but theyre fascinating arent they i never expected to run into people like these on such a technologically advanced planet
this isnt an anthropological mission commander
youre right we should keep searching for debris argh
youre developing an infection you should rest
ill have to stay here and try to keep out of sight
ill contact you if i find anything useful
i guess i dont have to tell you to avoid interacting with these people
seven of nine to chakotay
seven of nine to chakotay
commander respond ive found something seven of nine to chakotay
step away from him
its all right seven theyre friendly theyre treating my wound
you said we were supposed to avoid interaction
they found me there was nothing i could do
you should have tried to contact me
i didnt want to expose them to our technology
you hid your comm badge
actually your call scared them they broke it
i suggest we leave before they break anything else
look theyre friendly and i am hurt
what are you suggesting
we may as well stay the night
commander
its good shelter and my leg feels better since they put this dressing on im going to get some rest i suggest you do the same
chell says we shouldnt miss the flame gardens
i hear the arboretum is beautiful too
we can do both
tom you joining us oh thats right you have to go to pilot school
i hear the course takes days
yeah for most people but i did a little research if the instructor agrees you can skip the lessons and go right to the test so i will be seeing you in a couple of hours
you  have to admire his optimism
just a moment sir
i am mister kleg the flying instructor are you lieutenant paris
he is
its an honour to meet you sir may i show you to the delta flyer
why
so you can explain what i did wrong and then administer the test
it sounds to me like you need lessons in patience as well
oh tom is very patient sir
never impulsive
take all the time you need hell enjoy the extra attention
well im please to hear it well start with a review of safety procedures do you have a visual display system i can access
i think i can find one
have fun
energise
so how long will this review take
oh typically about four hours but theres no rush
of course not
river
river
mountain
mountain
where are we
this
you want to trade well i suppose it wont hurt
ill take that as a thank you
did you make a favourable exchange
i didnt want to insult their customs any luck
i may have found a way of communicating
me too ive learned to say thank you
i was referring to communication with voyager it may be possible to construct a beacon by connecting these components to the shuttles deflector
did you find it
i detected it six kilometres from here i believe its intact
im not sure im up to that long a trip
ill go
ive started mapping the area heres the river we passed this is where we beamed down and were here now
then the deflector should be approximately here
six kilometres is a long way maybe one of them could guide you
im still trying to limit our contact with these people
the sooner you get to the deflector the sooner we can get out of here they know the terrain maybe they can get you there faster
and watch me construct a tetrionbased signalling device
all right but be careful seven this is how they say goodbye
thank you
hello
identify yourself
an exothermic reaction
im not hungry
inadequate system integration visibility impaired by lateral sensor array insufficient console accessibility
you know i couldnt agree more those are some of the defects that led to my socalled pilot error
polarity thrusters oh theyve been known to cause accidental acceleration
exactly my point why should i be held responsible for the ships design flaws
according to the maintenance records you were this vessels chief designer i make it a point of professional pride to research every case im assigned to are you familiar with that term lieutenant professional pride
yes sir in fact that is why im so eager to get underway i want to prove to you that im a good pilot
there are protocols mister paris system by system diagnostics preflight simulations
you must have other students who need your attention it wouldnt be fair to
dont worry lieutenant im planning to spend as much time with you as you need
good morning
im trying to go here
can you show me
yes i thought it was this way
yes its quite an impressive view now we really have to
my friend she hasnt come back i need to find her
she looks like this where
whered you get this
my friend where
dont touch that please
problem
commander chakotay failed to report in at the scheduled time we tried hailing but there was no response
we contacted the conference coordinator he said seven and chakotay never showed up
anything on sensors
weve located a hull signature over the southern subcontinent but its only a wing
nothing else no lifesigns
no maam
thats awfully low for something to be in orbit
its not in orbit its resting on an energy barrier
we think the shuttle may have collided with it
why didnt they see it
standard scans didnt reveal its presence we were only able to detect it with our borg sensors
if all you found was a wing maybe the rest of the shuttle made it through the barrier
logic suggests that possibility unfortunately the barriers deflecting all our scans theres no way to know if the shuttle or its occupants are on the other side
hail the ledosian ambassador
wed have warned your commander but his flight plan didnt go anywhere near that area
he must have altered his route for some reason
and collided with the barrier im sorry
were not assuming theyre dead
we believe they may have found a way through
thats very unlikely
theyre resourceful people can you tell us anything about the barrier
it shields the territory of an indigenous society the ventu
then the areas habitable if you lowered the barrier we could scan for our peoples lifesigns
im afraid we cant do that
why not
it was erected by aliens hundreds of years ago they havent been back the technology is a mystery to us
why did these aliens build the barrier
to protect the ventu
from whom
us our ancestors fought them polluted their habitat im afraid we werent very enlightened back then
earth went through its dark periods too ambassador would you have any objections if we tried to lower the barrier just to scan for our people
i told you its not possible
perhaps if you gave us information about the barriers power source
the generator is inside theres no way to access it even if your people did survive im afraid theres no way to get them out
the burn patterns suggest a tetrion flux
we found a reference to similar technology in sevens borg database
you think the borg erected it
no but it may have been constructed by people they later assimilated species three one two
if seven were here she might be able to figure out a way to get through it
maybe she already did some of the damage to the wing was caused by feedback from the shuttles phasers
seven and chakotay might have used them to penetrate the barrier for some reason
if i can determine the appropriate frequency i may be able to do the same thing but there is risk involved
what sort of risk
it looks like the feedback from the barrier is what destroyed the shuttle if were not careful the same thing could happen to voyager
may i see those
seven is everything all right
i need your tricorder
nice to see you too
i lost mine theres a strong magnetic field here thats preventing me from generating a deflector beam but the field drops off approximately four point eight kilometres in that direction
can you transmit the signal from there
not through the barrier but i may be able to neutralise it by generating a dampening field with our deflector
even if youre right this must weight five hundred kilos how would we move it
some of them could help us
we shouldnt involve them
do i detect a change in attitude commander
your concern was justified theyve been gathering debris from the shuttle using it to imitate us i dont want them helping
whats the alternative staying here allowing them to find all of the debris if we neutralise the barrier voyager can transport us and our technology off the surface
is there a possibility that this dampening field could disrupt the barrier permanently
unlikely once the deflector is deactivated the barrier should reinitialise
lets hope youre right
so you can execute a turn at less than three hundred kph well done lieutenant
thanks you know i dont want to seem impatient again but is there any way youd let me take that test now
i thought id made myself clear about that all my students complete the entire course
i understand sir but two of my friends are missing and id like to help find them
well thats an admirable sentiment but if i give you special treatment it wouldnt be fair to the others who have to take this course besides why stop now youre getting very close to becoming an adequate pilot
here commander
not so close
phasers are starting to overload
can we divert any more power to the shields
the shields are amplifying the feedback
the barriers interfering with every system we activate
cease fire im open to suggestions
we may be able to reconfigure a photon torpedo to detonate at the appropriate frequency
what about feedback
a torpedo shouldnt create any theoretically
do it
theyre too close
back behind the rise stay back
the energy barriers coming down
i thought you were still reconfiguring the torpedo
i am its being deactivated from the inside
harry scan for lifesigns
aye captain
take it off
im only reading one comm badge its sevens
open a channel janeway to seven
are you and chakotay all right
yes captain
stand by for transport
lock on to commander chakotay i need more time
is there a problem
someones been injured she requires medical attention
do you need the doctor
i believe i can treat her a medkit would be useful
acknowledged
the poultice healed the fracture and the infection im impressed
theyre impressive people i just hope we havent traumatised them
you did what you had to do to get out of there
still i think we transport all the shuttle debris back to voyager as soon as possible
agreed
would you like some breakfast im not hungry either
i admire your curiosity but you should be more careful its time for me to leave
back to my home
thats very kind but i have no use for it i supposed i should respect your customs thank you
these botanical specimens indicate a high level of serum nitrates
catalogue those foliates
explain your presence here
oh you must be from voyager
who are you
 my name is barus im the expedition leader
what kind of expedition are you leading
were conducting scans to evaluate the potential of this habitat
potential for what
anthropological research resource development weve been waiting years for this
what about the people who live here
well help them of course
how
with medicine infrastructure education whoever lowered this barrier did the ventu a great favour
that barrier has to go back up
isnt it possible the ledosians will improve the lives of the ventu
improve them how
theyre intelligent people exposure to education and technology may give them better opportunities
can you honestly say that you know whats better for them
no i cant
then what do you think we should do
im uncertain
its not like you to be on the fence
when commander chakotay and i first encountered the ventu i found them primitive of little interest to me but as i spent time with them i came to realise that theyre a resourceful selfreliant people their isolation may limit their potential but if that isolation ends so will a unique way of life
we appreciate your help in opening this territory to exploration captain its an unprecedented opportunity
a shortlived opportunity im afraid
i dont understand
after i transport our deflector back to voyager the energy barrier will go back up
naturally youll want to get your people out so they wont be trapped inside as ours were
you have no right to limit our access to our own territory
im not trying to do that but we have a strict policy about leaving our technology in the hands of other cultures it often has damaging consequences
i dont think you realise how important this is its not only the resources that interest us the ventu are our evolutionary ancestors our living history
i understand this is disappointing for you but im afraid i have no choice
in the spirit of cooperation i hope youll reconsider
were eager to resume course would an hour be enough time to evacuate your people
ill make the arrangements
weve transported all the remaining debris to the cargo bay
i have a lock on the deflector assembly
what is it
theres a ledosian vessel on an intercept course its charging weapons
shields
direct hit to the transporters theyre offline
get a weapons lock and hail them
theyre hailing us
captain janeway
whats going on
our government has decided not to let you restore the barrier
and that justifies an unprovoked attack
we only targeted your transporters to avoid harming your crew i hope youll show the same restraint
i dont find weapons fire of any kind restrained
if you want to avoid further conflict i suggest you leave
take us out of orbit
what about the deflector
is tom still in the flyer
yes maam
hail him
excellent mister paris now come about slowly
janeway to paris respond
captain id appreciate it if you didnt interrupt my student during his examination
im sorry
but somethings come up
 what is it captain
tom im sending you some encrypted orders
yes maam
this is highly irregular
youre going much too fast
yes sir im in a bit of a hurry
if you have any desire to pass this test you will reduce your speed immediately
i wish i could do that sir i really do
what was that
paris to voyager
im under attack
give him some help mister tuvok
what have you done
we had to get you out of there before we close the barrier
you cant do that
just sit back and enjoy the ride paris to voyager ive got them
find the deflector
im getting a lock on it now
my transporters are offline
youd better get out of there tom
not yet
ive got an idea
i am sorry to inform you mister paris but you have failed this examination you will no longer be allowed to operate a vessel within ledosian space
something tells me thats not going to be a problem
this is a beautiful blanket
take it if youd like i dont need it
if environmental systems ever go down you might get cold you know i
id like to
you first
please continue
in all the excitement i never apologised
for what
causing you to miss that conference
as a matter of fact i wanted to thank you for that
i thought you were angry
i was but you were right warp mechanics can be studied any time the ventu on the other hand
somethings still bothering you
im concerned for their wellbeing
they know how to take care of themselves
thats not what i mean members of the ledosian expedition had the opportunity to scan my deflector modifications in time they may find a way to duplicate our technology and remove the barrier themselves
i supposed its possible
if id never made those modifications
we might still be stranded there i dont know about you but im glad to be back on voyager
as am i
now these are delicious
leave some for the rest of us
hey im eating for two
great party neelix
everybody seems to be enjoying it
yeah except the doc
those are for eating not scanning
what exactly are they
cheese pirogues zefram cochranes favourite
they have absolutely no nutritional value
this is a party doctor sometimes you have to forget about nutrition
you could include a vitamin supplement when you replicate them
replicate i made them myself
you two have outdone yourselves ive never seen first contact day celebrated quite like this when i was your age all it meant was a day off from school
neelix and i thought we should make it more fun
well you certainly succeeded
when is commander tuvok making his presentation
well nows as good a time as any captain
may i have everyones attention please in honour of the three hundred and fifteenth anniversary of his ancestors arrival on earth ive asked mister tuvok to recite the first words spoken to humans by a vulcan commander
is this really necessary
you promised
very well live long and prosper
and now for some more of zefram cochranes favourite music hey come on mister vulcan
vulcans do not dance
but its tradition
there is no tradition mister neelix this ceremony is entirely your invention
this is an official ship function commander dont make me order you to dance
sorry to interrupt but ive got some interesting news neelix you might want to hear this long range sensors have detected several hundred lifesigns approximately four point nine light years away theyre talaxian
are we there yet
not exactly the lifesigns appear to be coming from inside that asteroid field
from a ship
we are not detecting any vessels
no response from hails
not yet
i hope theyre all right
theres a lot of interference maybe they havent received our transmissions
can we move in any closer
voyagers too big to manoeuvre safely in there we could take the flyer
it wouldnt have hurt you to do a few steps
i am trying to concentrate on the shields mister neelix
i think you were just afraid
thats absurd
its understandable there were a lot of people watching
vulcans dont experience fear
im going to make it my personal mission to get you to dance at least once before we reach earth
then i suggest you find a more productive hobby
if you two dont stop it im going to come back there and separate you
ive localised the lifesigns bearing one zero eight mark twenty six they appear to be inside a large asteroid
inside
what was that
a thermalyte explosive thirty point six kilometres to port im detecting another projectile heading directly toward us evasive manoeuvres
weve lost shields
main propulsion is offline were going to have to make an emergency landing
where
the talaxians asteroid is the closest
the surface is covered with craters ice fields
we dont have a choice hold on
problem
weve lost contact with the away team i also detected some unusual energy discharges in the asteroid field
what kind of discharges
its difficult to tell because of the interference but they appear to be thermalytic explosions i believe several of them were in close proximity to the flyer
source
unknown
well need to send a rescue team work with belanna try to modify the shields on one of the shuttles to withstand these explosions
stay still dont worry its not serious
am i inside the asteroid
yes this is my home
where are my friends
if you mean the aliens who were on the ship with you theyre safe
id like to see them
you need to rest what were you doing in the asteroid field
looking for you well not you specifically but my ship detected talaxians i havent come across any in years so im sorry im neelix
dexa i had an uncle named neelix are there other talaxians on your ship
im the only one
why are you living with aliens
theyre my friends did you receive our hails
yes
why didnt you respond
we avoid contact with outsiders
we were attacked there were explosions did you
no were not violent
who fired at us
no one fired at you there are miners who use explosive charges to break apart the asteroids so they can collect minerals from the debris
i wish wed known
why were you carrying weapons
its standard procedure for an away mission hello whats your name
brax whats yours
i told you not to come in here
i just want to see him
youre supposed to be helping oxilon
he doesnt look dangerous to me
i think you have the wrong idea about us
im not supposed to be talking to you at all
im feeling better id like to see my friends now
what are you doing
ive been told not to let you leave
harry
still no response to hails
janeway to the shuttlebay
go ahead captain
whats the status of the shield modifications
lieutenant torres and i will be finished in a few minutes
good  take an away team and find them
captain theres a ship approaching from astern were being hailed
on screen
identify yourselves
im captain janeway of the federation starship voyager
commander nocona this is our asteroid field
we werent aware of that
now you are
we lost one of our shuttles inside the field were preparing to send a rescue team
all the resources belong to us
were not interested in the resources we were only trying to make contact with the talaxians
whats your interest in them
one of my crewmen is from talax he was eager to meet some of his people
you should have requested permission before sending in a shuttle we have a mining operation in progress
does that explain the explosions we detected
mining charges
wed appreciate it if youd stop using them until we can get our people out
im sorry were on a strict deadline but ill conduct a search for your crew if they need help well provide it
thats kind of you but were prepared to go in and get them ourselves
i cannot guarantee your safety if you enter the asteroid field stay here well contact you when we find your people
i dont think youre supposed to be here
this is my home you cant tell me what to do
no of course not i just dont want you to get in trouble is that a model ship whats it called how about the twotailed talchok the fur fly the ship i come from is called voyager
is it big
and fast
can i see it
i think it would be a little difficult to take you there while im stuck here but if your mother would let me out
thats her
you better hide
you wont tell her im here
no of course not
neelix this is oxilon our council regent
i wish i could say it was nice to meet you but this wasnt exactly the welcome i was expecting
youre free to go now
what about my friends
weve determined they arent hostile theyve been treated for their injuries and asked to leave
theyre aboard your shuttle making repairs ill take you there
well now that everything has been cleared up maybe we could talk get to know each other a little
if you like
my friends too
im sorry
why not
weve learned from experience to keep to ourselves
well if theyre not welcome im not staying either
thats your choice
i know oxilon seems overly cautious but were not used to having visitors
how many of you live here
close to five hundred all of our homes are connected to the central cabin by tunnels and lifts they allow us to easily move from one section of the asteroid to another
it must have taken years to build all of this
almost five it still isnt finished
where did the technology come from
we arrived here with a caravan of six ships we disassembled all but one of them and modified their components we converted torpedo launchers to blast away rock and excavate these tunnels these conduits run into the asteroids core we use geothermal energy to melt the ice that covers most of the outer surface it provides us with oxygen and water
whod have imagined all of this inside an asteroid your son seems like a wonderful boy
how would you know you only met him for a few seconds
true but im a quick judge of character
he came to see you while i was out didnt he
you cant blame him for being curious
hmm hes a lot like his father no fear
id like to meet your husband
hes dead
im sorry i didnt mean to
its all right you didnt know
neelix are you all right
im fine dexa this is lieutenant paris and commander tuvok
thanks for bringing him back we were getting worried
it was nice to meet you
so what can i do to help
you can give me a hand with this plasma manifold how did it go
well er they didnt exactly send out a welcoming committee but im sure they had their reasons i guess my expectations were a little high
i regret that you didnt have a more fulfilling experience
thats nice of you to say commander but it wasnt a complete waste of time i got to meet some of my people again even if it was a short visit who knows its probably the last time ill ever see another talaxian
good work now we need to run a systems
intruder alert
at least we know internal sensors are working
brax
you know him
were old friends
you said youd take me to see voyager
i dont think your mother would approve
you wont tell her i was here will you
here i i have no idea what youre talking about ill be right back
three days isnt nearly enough time for us to dismantle all our equipment
then you should have begun the first time we asked we cant wait any longer demolition of the asteroid is going to start whether youre here or not
youd kill us
we dont want to hurt anyone but our patience has run out
weve only got one ship there wont be enough room for any of our belongings
its not our fault you took apart your other vessels
you cant do this
dex dont provoke him
where are we supposed to go
im sure youll find a home somewhere
this is our home you have no right to make us go
leave her alone
bring him here
dont touch him
are you going to stop me
youve said what youve come to say now i suggest you leave
you have three days to evacuate
you can see now why were suspicious of outsiders
thank you for protecting the boy but im afraid your actions might make things worse
how could they get any worse
fighting back has never done anything but cause us more trouble
and what has running away ever done for us
its kept us alive
maybe its time we stayed and defended ourselves will you help us
i agree with oxilon fighting isnt the answer but ill try to help
how
well we could talk to my captain maybe she can negotiate with the miners get them to agree to let you stay
your captain would be willing to do that
the best thing would be for you to come to voyager talk to her yourself
i want to go too
shush brax
why dont you both come ive seen your home id like you to see mine
commander chakotay id like you to meet dexa and brax
welcome to the bridge
and this is ensign kim
whats this
this is an engineering station and over there is tactical and down there is the helm and this is the captains chair
which station is yours
well actually i dont have a specific er im more of a
neelix does too many things to have just one station hes our ambassador morale officer
trade negotiator without a doubt hes the most versatile member of our crew
as you can see our sensors are extremely precise we can scan for life signs light years away
thats how we found you
i have something else that may interest you
what is it
talax you can scan that far away
no this image is from our database
its as beautiful as i remember
theres the godo mountain range
and the axiana lakes that was always one of my favourite places
mine too
why dont we just go back to talax we could live there
its still controlled by the haakonians they dont treat talaxians very well thats why we left
maybe neelix could go with us and we could fight them take the planet back
if tomorrows negotiations go well you wont have to go anywhere
next stop engineering
the warp core
neelix
naomi im sorry i forgot all about our kadiskot game
thats all right i know youre busy i just wanted to meet your friends
of course dexa brax this is my goddaughter naomi
hey
you live on a beautiful ship
thanks maybe brax would like to go to the holodeck
thats a great idea
lieutenant paris has a new programme invaders from the ninth dimension
sounds scary
very
whats a holodeck
neelix is right might be too scary for you
im not afraid can i
youre lucky to have found these people they obviously think a great deal of you
the feelings mutual
to the axiana lakes
it really is delicious
ive been saving it for fifteen years i wasnt sure id ever open it but tonight seemed like the right occasion would you like some more taga cake
a little please i havent had this in years
im glad you like it its a family recipe
youre a good cook i havent seen brax this happy since his father was alive
how did he im sorry you probably dont want to talk about it
i dont mind wed settled on a planet call phanos there was a lot of unoccupied territory but the government restricted us to a very small area
why
they said it was a quarantine to protect the population from alien diseases but it was just an excuse we were outsiders they didnt want us mixing with their people it wasnt long before we realised we didnt have enough land to grow what we needed to feed ourselves oxilon said wed just have to conserve our resources but my husband was tired of being told what to do so he started farming outside the restricted zone
they didnt like that
a security patrol confronted him he told them he had to provide for his family that he wasnt afraid of them there was a fight he was killed
im sorry
after that we came here we thought wed finally found a place where no one would bother us
maybe this time itll be different
maybe but even if it isnt thank you for trying
i should get a good nights sleep if im going to be my best at the negotiations tomorrow
neelix its been a wonderful day
isnt there enough to mine here without destroying their home
their home contains more than thirty percent of the fields ore without that asteroid the operation isnt worth the expense
would you be open to some kind of compensation
all we want are the minerals
and youd kill us to get them
wait the talaxians have found a way to produce a lot of geothermal energy maybe they could share it with you
what do you mean share
you could convert it into fuel to power your ships
the energy they generate isnt compatible with our technology
wed be willing to help you make the modifications
we have quotas to meet we dont have time for that
commander the future of more than five hundred people is at stake here
and once there was a transporter accident neelix and commander tuvok got combined to make a completely different person
really
you dont think i could make up a story like that do you
hello neelix
do you want to play kadiskot
maybe later
i knew it wouldnt work
we did get them to make a small concession theyve extended the deadline youll have enough time to dismantle your equipment
thanks but theres too much to take with us
captain janeway has agreed to ferry all of you and your supplies to the nearest m class planet
come on brax were going home
why
we have to pack come on
you said you were going to help us
brax
you wanted to see me
ive detected five warp capable species within two light years of the planet where were taking the talaxians im worried they might be vulnerable to attack
they would be vulnerable anywhere
i thought maybe you could help me devise some defence strategies for their new home
frankly mister neelix they dont seem inclined to defend themselves
no i suppose not
but if they were going to make a stand their emotional attachment to their present home might be an asset
are you saying they should stay
im speaking hypothetically
hypothetically if they wanted to defend the asteroid how would they do it
to begin with they would need to establish some kind of perimeter
you mean shields
yes the miners are monitoring the asteroid if they detected the talaxians erecting a shield they would attempt to stop them
i suppose so
your people would need competent leadership to defend against a preemptive attack
if you had the captains permission would you be willing to provide that leadership
certainly not it would be a violation of the prime directive and even if it werent i dont believe that i am the person most qualified to assume that role
you mean me
i am merely speaking hypothetically
i couldnt lead those people mister tuvok im not a fighter im just a cook who sometimes imagines himself to be a diplomat
on the contrary mister neelix you are much more than that you are perhaps the most resourceful individual i have ever known
i always thought you just tolerated me
you do have some annoying habits however during your time on voyager youve developed many valuable skills skills that would serve you well if you ever decided to assume a leadership role
you really think so
let me be clear im not urging you to do anything im simply telling you that i believe that you are more than capable
going somewhere mister neelix
just to see my friends
chakotay tells me youre using your own ship why not have tom take you in the flyer
i didnt want to bother anyone
you wouldnt be planning anything foolish would you
whatever i do i promise it wont involve voyager
that wasnt my question
i know you have prime directive issues but im not officially part of your crew so i dont have the same constraints
youre as much a part of this crew as anyone else
are you ordering me not to go
that depends on what youre going to do
its up to the talaxians
safe journey mister neelix
i know from personal experience that you have forcefield emitters we could use them to establish a shield grid wed need to deploy a series of them on the asteroids surface along bisecting diameters sixteen emitters should be enough to form a grid
even if youre right itd take weeks to dig that many tunnels to the surface
commander tuvok suggested that we could modify the emitters so they could be fired from torpedo tubes on your ship and planted in the surface
as soon as the miners realised what we were doing theyd attack
i could provide cover from my ship but youre right wed have to work quickly
we could route power to the emitters directly from the core theyd have a permanent energy supply
good idea
if we do what youre suggesting people are going to be hurt
this is your home the miners have no right to force you out
i agree but fighting
i dont like it either but at some point you have to stand up for yourselves how do you know there wont be someone else to terrorise you the next place you go
you know hes right
no one has worked harder to build this place than you isnt it worth defending
wait for my comm call as soon as the last emitters in place start routing power to the grid
understood
youre scared arent you
you
terrified
be careful
i will
oxilon to neelix the emitters are loaded were ready
ill see you soon
two more and were done
acknowledged
were moving into position for the next one
the miners ship is on an intercept course evasive manoeuvres
theyre targeting our shields
ill deal with them
just focus on your job all right mister vulcan lets see if you were right about me
neelix you have to hurry
just one more emitter
and you can activate the shield
neelix to oxilon
my weapons are offline
were not in position yet
you have to get there theyre going to launch another charge
neelix what are you doing
dont worry about me
just get ready to bring the grid online
delta flyer to neelix are you all right
fine captain but you shouldnt be here
youre violating the prime directive
were just helping a friend in distress
dexa to neelix the shields holding
you did it
we did it
were grateful for everything youve done
im just happy things worked out and im glad that i could spend some time here with all of you id better go
stay here
he cant brax he has responsibilities on voyager
i promise ill stay in touch as long as i can
come in
hi
neelix
what are you working on
a report on protohumanoid cultures for commander chakotays palaeontology class
need some help
im almost finished
do you have time for a game of kadiskot
i have to get up early
i guess youd better get to sleep then do you want me to tuck you in tell you a bedtime story
you havent done that in years
just think of all the stories youve missed
thanks neelix but i can put myself to bed im not a little girl anymore
i didnt think anyone else stayed up this late
i wouldnt want you to have coffee all by yourself
have a seat
ive been thinking about something its a little hard to put into words and i havent really made a decision yet and of course i would never ignore my responsibilities on voyager
of course not
i take them very seriously
i know you do ive been thinking about something too maybe you could help me
id be happy to
its an idea id need to talk to starfleet command about
it must be important
it is now that weve established two way communication with earth it seems to me starfleet could use a permanent ambassador in the delta quadrant this ambassador would have to stay in frequent contact with voyager
certainly
it would be difficult for me to run this ship without you neelix but that might be a sacrifice id be willing to make for the greater good of starfleet of course the assignment would be entirely voluntary you wouldnt be interested would you
goodbye and good luck ambassador
mister neelix
live long and prosper
questa o quella per me pari sono a quantaltre dintorno mi vedo del mio core limpero non cedo meglio ad una che ad altre belta la costoro avvenenza e qual dono di che ilfato ne infiora la vita soggi questa mi torna gradita forse unaltra forse unaltra
captain computer pause music i didnt wake you did i
thats all right doctor fifteen minutes of sleep is really all i need coffee black maybe you should pay a little more attention to flying and a little less to singing
as a hologram i can handle a variety of tasks at once in addition to piloting the flyer im writing a paper on the physiological stresses of long duration space flight and taking holoimages of this mutara class nebula
with a hologram on board who needs a crew
id never admit this to anyone else but there was a time when i would have given anything to be flesh and blood but ive come to realise that being a hologram is far superior
really
no offence ill always enjoy the company of organics in fact im delighted you were able to attend this medical symposium with me its been a pleasure spending time with you actually i was hoping we might do this sort of thing more often
hmm were passing through a subspace eddy
it could be the wake of another ship
no theres nothing on sensors its probably just the gravimetric shear from the nebula
maybe i should take the controls
sit down and relax captain youve got a hologram at the helm
the plasma surges have to be coming from one of these relays  try realigning the deuterium manifolds
paris to torres
go ahead
can you pull yourself away from engineering for a few minutes ive got a shuttle down here with faulty deflector array
im a little busy right now
its kind of urgent
whats this
well i thought youd enjoy a romantic lunch under the glow of a red giant
oh you replicated potato salad
with extra paprika just the way you like it
this is so sweet but i cant
sure you can ive already cleared it with chakotay
i told the captain id have the dilithium matrix recalibrated before she got back
you know this might be our last chance to be alone for the next eighteen years
i will make some time before the baby comes i promise oh ive got to get back
report
theres some kind of pulse being directed at our transceiver array its coming from the delta flyer
hail them
no response
looks like theyve encoded the pulse with a comm signal
captain
sorry about the image ensign our comm systems been damaged the only way i could send you a signal was through the main deflector
are you and the doctor all right
were fine tell commander chakotay to meet me in my ready room as soon as weve docked janeway out
harry tells me the flyer took some damage
thats an understatement we almost didnt make it back in one piece theyre called the rkaal their technology is decades ahead of ours transphasic warp drive multispectral cloaking systems they could destroy this ship before our sensors knew they were there
they sound like people we should avoid
i wish that were possible they control thousands of parsecs from here to the edge of the beta quadrant theyre ecological extremists they believe conventional warp engines damage subspace so theyve outlawed warp travel through their territory
then we should reverse course and find a way around
thats the problem weve already been in their space for three weeks without knowing it
youd think theyd mark their borders a little more clearly
as punishment their law demands that our ship be dismantled
obviously were not going to let that happen
i spent three hours explaining our situation to their supreme archon a thoroughly unpleasant man i convinced him to spare voyager but at a price were going to rendezvous with their armada and surrender our warp core at a class m planet where theyve agreed to let us settle
settle
i didnt make this decision lightly chakotay
we have to bring the senior staff in on this we can find a way to evade their ships or adapt our sensors to their cloaking technology
we could try that and we might make it past their armada but we could lose a lot of people in the process maybe the entire ship
kathryn theres got to be another way
im tired chakotay tired of casualty reports of continually risking my people on the slim chance that well make it home in one piece
weve found our way out of worse situations
set a course
what am i supposed to tell the crew
for now id like to keep this between us
its not like you to keep your people in the dark
ill make an announcement when the time is right dismissed
captain
im sorry to interrupt but i could use your input on a hypothetical scenario
of course
if we were to eject the core could it be towed safely at warp
in theory but a tractor beam might destabilise the containment field youd be risking a breach
could you compensate for that
you could configure the tractor emitters to generate a resonance pulse that should stabilise the field
can you make those modifications to the delta flyers tractor emitters
i suppose
how long would it take
er a few hours
get started
i thought this was a hypothetical scenario
we should be prepared just in case
in case of what
let me know as soon as youre finished
torres to chakotay
go ahead
have you got a minute
belanna tells me you ordered some modifications to the flyer
thats right
maybe i misunderstood i thought the plan was to hand over the core when we reached the planet are we taking it somewhere else
i heard you the first time
captain
youve already made your concerns clear commander but theres been a slight change of plans
were you going to tell me kathryn whats going on
i dont feel well ive got a headache im going to my quarters and id prefer not to be disturbed you have the bridge
not now
i beg your pardon captain
carry on commander
chakotay to the doctor
go ahead commander
report to sickbay immediately
something wrong with the turbolifts
you did say immediately how can i help you
im concerned about the captain she doesnt seem to be feeling well
whats wrong
im not sure she went to her quarters with a headache
ill bring her an analgesic
i was wondering if this could be related to your encounter with the aliens
you think they harmed her
you tell me what did they do to her
im not sure exactly the aliens took my programme offline as soon as they boarded the flyer the captain reactivated me a few hours later and told me shed been interrogated naturally i examined her to make sure she was all right
did you find anything unusual
i suppose im violating doctorpatient confidentiality by telling you this but she was fine
id like you to give her a more thorough examination
gladly but you know how she feels about physicals
you can be very persuasive doctor contact me as soon as youre done
aye sir
anything interesting on sensors this morning
nothing extraordinary a red giant and two g type stars a golorian trading vessel bearing one five six mark four
if there were a fleet of cloaked ships in the vicinity could you devise a way to detect them
a cloaked fleet would generate significant subspace distortions why do you ask
commander were receiving a transmission
source
im having trouble pinpointing it should i notify the captain
no she didnt want to be disturbed route the call here
im commander chakotay of the starship voyager
this is supreme archon loth of the rkaal imperium why havent you ejected your warp core as your captain agreed
were en route to the planet you specified we cant jettison the core until we get there
if we dont receive the core within ten hours my armada will destroy your ship this is your only warning
work with harry i want to know the source of that transmission
understood
ah commander youll be relieved to know ive given the captain a clean bill of health
did you run a neurological scan
mmm hmm her brain activity and cognitive functions are completely normal as far as i can tell shes perfectly fit physically and mentally
thank you doctor
chakotay to the captain computer locate captain janeway
computer belay that my quarters now
really chakotay sending the doctor to check up on me
im concerned
then why didnt you come to me directly i thought we trusted each other
so did i something happened on that away mission that youre not telling me
ive told you everything you need to know
youve consulted me on every major decision over the last seven years except this one why
there are some decisions a captain has to make on her own
i understand that but every instinct tells me what youre doing is wrong dont you remember what happened on lesik prime
i dont see how thats relevant
i think you do fifteen years ago you were the lieutenant who was kept in the dark if you hadnt questioned your captains orders the entire away team would have been lost
this situations entirely different
you never told me that story i made it up chakotay to tuvok
ive erected a dampening field around these quarters im sorry commander
computer secure the doors and establish a level five dampening field around the morgue
i cant do my job with the two of you constantly talking in my head
no im not doing anything else until i speak with the captain fine whats your encryption frequency
captain are you all right
doctor listen to me under no circumstances are you to eject the warp core
if i dont do what they ask theyll kill you
im giving you a direct order stop what youre doing
im sorry captain i cant obey that order
doctor i want you to go to the bridge right now and alert commander tuvok
put her behind the forcefield
we have another assignment for you ive been going over the schematics of your vessel and im intrigued by this bioneural circuitry i want you to bring us a series of these gel packs
the gel packs are integrated into the ships systems i cant just remove them without someone noticing
youve proven yourself to be very resourceful doctor youll find a way remember were monitoring your perceptual subroutines we can see and hear everything
tuvok to chakotay
you know what will happen to her if you alert your crew
go ahead
are you all right commander
just a scratchy throat the doctors treating me now
could you come to the shuttlebay when youre finished
ill be right there chakotay out computer access the holodeck database and locate commander chakotays holographic template download the physical parameters into my programme
you wanted to see me
ive completed the diagnostic as you requested the flyers comm system is functioning normally
you find that unusual
the captain did report that it was damaged
during the attack by the rkaal
ill have a talk with her did you find anything else out of the ordinary
no
get out of there before you arouse suspicion
ill be on the bridge if you need me
youre doing a wonderful job doctor im just giving him a little encouragement
thats why im in command
if all goes well we should have the warp core in less than six hours hes making excellent progress
thats exactly what he wants you to believe
what do you mean
did you really think you could outsmart a hologram
everything appears to be normal
how do you know youre not looking at a holographic projection the doctor isnt just a physician his emergency command subroutines contain thousands of tactical scenarios i wouldnt be surprised if voyager was already on its way here you do have an option leave me behind in an escape pod and ill forget any of this ever happened
maybe we should let her go
are you delusional it took months to plan this weve already found a buyer for the warp core now you want to abandon everything
its better than being sent to a rehabilitation centre
we made our choice when we stole this vessel i am not going back to the hierarchy and neither are you shes just trying to trick you a month from now well be soaking in the mud baths of eblar prime trust me
janeway to torres
torres here
im having a little trouble with my replicator again can you take a look at it
im still working on those modifications you asked for ill send somebody else
id consider it a personal favour if youd do it yourself lieutenant
ill be there in five minutes
thank you janeway out  computer access lieutenant torres holographic template and download the physical parameters into my programme
computer access medical file torres three and update her holographic template
did you forget something lieutenant
i did actually where do we keep the spare gel packs
locker gamma five
of course gamma five
on the upper level
i know where it is ensign
you left me no choice
lieutenant
oh are we calling each other by our rank now
er you startled me
oh sorry well i thought since you didnt have time for lunch under the stars maybe youd settle for the glow of the warp core
how thoughtful but im not hungry
well im sure the baby is famished
a pregnant woman shouldnt eat this kind of food do you want to give me an arterial occlusion
one drumstick isnt going to kill you besides i wont tell the doctor if you wont
you know this all looks so delicious why dont we save it for a romantic dinner this evening
all right nineteen hours but if youre not there im sending security after you
ill be there sweetheart
sweetheart well arent you getting affectionate in your third trimester
ill see you later
kim to chakotay can you come to astrometrics
harry ill be right there chakotay out
the transmission was encoded with a false subspace signature
the signal didnt originate on another vessel it came from inside voyager
we traced it to holodeck two
do you know who sent it
im on my way to check the access logs
ill go with you
whoever sent this transmission knew how to cover his tracks the holodeck logs have been erased
doesnt look like well get any answers here
i might be able to find some residual phototonic displacement there we go i think i can clarify the image with a recursive algorithm
our aliens a hologram the question is who programmed him
good work ensign ill take it from here
wait a minute im picking up two holographic signatures it looks like a second image was superimposed over an existing template ill see if i can isolate the first image
doctor what are you doing
if you dont mind
ive had a stressful day
im extremely busy commander
this will only take a moment ive been reviewing the communication logs theres a discrepancy i was hoping you could explain
at the precise moment the flyer transmitted a deflector pulse you apparently accessed voyagers holographic database
i havent the faintest idea what youre talking about
your access code was used to download the captains physical parameters
exactly what are you insinuating commander
perhaps we should have a word with the captain
fine
computer deactivate the emh
emh protocols are offline
security to sickbay remain where you are
you havent forgotten im a hologram have you
if necessary ill disable all of your holoemitters
computer transfer the emh to the mobile emitter
all hands red alert security teams apprehend the doctor
computer open the holodeck doors
unable to comply access to the holodeck has been restricted
security override tuvok sigma four
computer end programme
unable to comply holodeck controls are offline
tuvok to engineering shut down power
to holodeck two
it looks like the doctors rerouted the power relays itll take a minute to bypass them
doctor ive reconfigured my phaser to disrupt your holomatrix surrender yourself now
tuvok to bridge
can you locate the doctor on the internal sensors
im not reading him he mustve masked his signature somehow
try scanning for the polydeutonic alloy in his emitter shut down all
turbolifts and transporters
acknowledged
get your people out of here the cores about to breach
im not detecting an overload
youre getting false readings the doctors reprogrammed your sensors
all right everybody out now move it
you too belanna
i might be able to stabilise the containment field
youre not putting your baby in danger go
youd better be right behind me
paris to torres im picking up the doctors emitter in your section
where
right next to the warp core
computer activate emergency command hologram
all command codes have been transferred to the ech
prepare to eject the warp core authorization ech omega four two
doctor dont do this
warp ejection system enabled
computer eject the core
computer lock on to my mobile emitter and transport me to the delta flyer
transporters are offline
tuvok we just lost main power
and internal sensors are down
the doctor has entered jefferies tube one one alpha send a security team to the shuttlebay
lieutenant
i think the doctors heading for the escape pods
you wouldnt shoot a pregnant woman would you
come with me doctor
tuvok someones launching the flyer
tuvok
ow
you might try disconnecting the phase discriminator
ha ive rebuilt dozens of these units but ive never seen this configuration before do you know how i can stabilise the ion flow
that looks like the charge inverter
thank you
youre welcome your ship must need a lot of replacement parts
oh those arent for this ship ive been collecting and repairing spare components for years this is from an old impulse drive would you believe i found it sitting in a waste depository ill be able to find a buyer now that its working
these parts could be worth a small fortune
thats exactly what i think im going to use my quarter of the profits to establish an outpost specialising in obsolete engine components im certain theres a demand for them
my chief engineer is always looking for spare parts she might be interested in acquiring your entire inventory
captain tut tut tut youre not trying to take advantage of my subordinate are you no ones ever going to buy this junk its almost as useless as you theres a ship approaching
this is the delta flyer ive got the warp core
but youre not getting it until you release the captain
are you insane you almost destabilised the core both of our ships wouldve been destroyed
this isnt a negotiation release your tractor beam now
all right
its in the cargo hold
lower your shields and well beam your captain to you
ready
we had an agreement
to spare your captain as you can see shes still alive
let the doctor go im the more valuable hostage
actually youre not well leave you in the vinry system the inhabitants are mostly harmless  the doctor will be working for us now
ill do no such thing
im sure youll feel differently after i make a few adjustments to your programme
i had no idea he was going to do this im sorry
i hope you realise youve stranded voyager in the delta quadrant
what did you expect me to do let them kill you
i expected you to follow my orders
you might as well have been ordering me to put a phaser to your head voyager can survive without a warp core but not without a captain
now it doesnt have either
theyre just unconscious paris to tuvok i found them
it is logical to assume the captain never returned from the away mission
do you have any idea where the flyer is
the doctor masked his ion trail
engineering to chakotay
go ahead
were ready to restart the impulse reactors
acknowledged
its playing on every comm channel on the ship
computer pause music
unable to comply
didnt the doctor play this at his recital last month
yes and as i recall he performed the piece flawlessly
maybe the recording was damaged by the power loss
or perhaps the doctor altered the music deliberately
why would he do that
i performed a fourier analysis on the recording the harmonics have been modified
it could be a comm frequency
unlikely theres no carrier wave
i could be wrong but it looks like a warp signature
the power utilisation curve would be about right
try scanning for it
im detecting a matching signature distance six point seven light years
we cant follow them at impulse
you and tom take a shuttle
what are you doing
if i can amplify your matrix i might be able to disrupt the forcefield
im sorry i put us in this position captain
you said you wanted us to spend more time together
this isnt what i had in mind maybe if we get back to the ship we could try socialising a little more
this really isnt the place to be talking about this besides i dont do a lot of socialising
you have meals with commander chakotay and you play velocity with seven
were going to have to discuss this later
i need to upload your first assignment
you want me to infiltrate the hierarchys surveillance complex
the data stored there is worth a hundred warp cores
how do you expect me to get past the security perimeter
im glad you asked
i trust this wont be permanent
ive given you the rank of a class one overseer youll be able to walk into central command without anyone noticing ive also uploaded several other holographic templates you might find useful
whats wrong
im not certain
the compression algorithms are breaking down
i told you his programme couldnt handle that much data
what have you done to me
im detecting a human lifesign aboard and a holographic signature
the vessels weapons are polaronbased and they have autoregenerative shielding
we still have the element of surprise
if you dont get him back to voyager his matrix will be permanently damaged
please do something
he wont be any use to us if he decompiles
someones boarded the delta flyer theyre moving away
fire at both vessels
now mister paris
the shield generator isnt going to last if we give them what they want maybe theyll leave
prepare to jettison their warp core
what are you doing
arming a torpedo if we detonate their core the blast wave should give us enough time to escape
that would kill them
captain get down
lieutenant lock a tractor beam onto the core and get it back to voyager
acknowledged
nar get this hologram off me
guess this wasnt so useless after all
are you still interested in acquiring my inventory
computer transfer the emh back into the holodeck buffer
can you stabilise his matrix
not until we purge the excess subroutines
theres more than a thousand teraquads of new data in here
how is he
were not sure yet
captain if i dont survive i need you to do something for me
youre going to be all right
if im not when you reach earth i want you to donate my emitter to the daystrom institute they may be able to replicate it someday so that other holograms can know the freedom ive enjoyed ive had something on my conscience for a long time after i was first activated i kept a record of what i considered to be your most questionable command decisions its in my personal database i hope youll delete the file without reading it mister tuvok i violated the most sacred trust between a physician and his patient i told mister neelix about the cutaneous eruption you developed on your that was indiscreet i hope you can forgive me ensign at your recital last month i told lieutenant torres that your saxophone playing reminded me of a wounded targ i shouldve put it more delicately im sorry seven
you should remain still
you have no idea how difficult its been hiding my true feelings all these years averting my eyes during your regular maintenance exams
i know you could never have the same feelings for me but i want you to know the truth i love you seven
your cognitive algorithms are malfunctioning
goodbye my friends speak well of me
is he
no ive got him
what happened
i deleted the extraneous subroutines
im not going to decompile
youll probably outlive us all
doc anything else youd like to confess
captain do you do you need medical attention
no youve been keeping to yourself lately your friends are worried about you
after my deathbed confession i wasnt sure i had any friends left i overstepped my bounds in documenting your command decisions it happened a long time ago before i considered myself to be a part of your crew
oh im not here to make you grovel im here to punish you for your insubordinate behaviour
i understand
youre hereby denied the use of your mobile emitter for six days since you havent left sickbay for a week well call it time served
i appreciate the gesture captain but ive got a lot of work to catch up on
im sorry to hear that i was hoping you might be free for a cup of coffee on the holodeck i know a little sidewalk café in buenos aires you said you wanted us to socialise more
i suppose mister paris can finish this
now when youre on the holodeck with the captain there are two rules you have to follow
i understand
first leave your rank at the door
not a problem the second
no opera
these should be familiar images to everyone who remembers the uss voyagers triumphant return to earth after twenty three years in the delta quadrant voyager captivated the hearts and minds of people throughout the federation so it seems fitting that on this the tenth anniversary of their return we take a moment to recall the sacrifices made by the crew corruption charges were brought today against a ferengi
computer end display
hello
whats your name
harry whats yours
sabrina
naomis daughter
ah ha
youve gotten so big
i dont remember you
i havent come to one of these reunions in four years
why
ive been on a deep space assignment
for four years
compared to how long i was on voyager it seemed like a long weekend can you find your mother for me
ah ha
id like to say hi
oops here you are captain
thank you admiral i havent seen her since she was a baby
its amazing how fast youve all grown
hows tuvok
not well
i thought maybe id go see him tomorrow
oh that would be nice
im sorry i missed the funeral i should have been there
you were on a mission everyone understood its so good to see you harry
doc
mister paris voyagers pilot medic and occasional thorn in my side where have you been hiding yourself
ive been busy
new holonovel
ill make sure to get your input before i send it off to my publisher arent you going to introduce me to your date
mister paris meet lana my blushing bride
youre married
tomorrow is our two week anniversary
well congratulations my invitation must have gotten lost in subspace
oh you should be flattered we took a page from your book and eloped
joe has a real flair for romantic gestures
joe
i decided i couldnt get married without a name
it took you thirty three years to come up with joe
it was lanas grandfathers name
oh oh so youre not a
a hologram no
frankly mister paris im surprised youd even ask i thought we were beyond those sorts of distinctions
are you kidding i think its great im in a mixed marriage myself remember
speaking of which where is that wife of yours
the high council had a lot of questions
what did you tell them
the truth with a klingon twist i told them that my beloved former captain who had saved my life many times in glorious battle would be honoured to submit koraths house for consideration
do you think it will work
im just the federation liaison but id like to think i have some influence you still havent told me why youre trying to help korath
hes an old friend
would this old friend have anything to do with the mission that you sent my daughter on
sorry belanna but you know i cant talk about that
couldnt you at least have waited until after the reunion she really wanted to be here
shell be home soon i promise
may i have everyones attention please ten years ago tonight this crew returned home from the longest away mission in starfleets history twenty three years together made you a family one im proud to have been adopted by lets raise our glasses to the journey
to the journey
and to those who arent here to celebrate it with us
ladies and gentlemen meet the borg
over the course of this term youre going to become intimately familiar with the collective youll learn about the assimilation process the borg hierarchy and the psychology of the hive mind and when it comes to your performance in this class my expectations are going to be no different than the borg queen herself perfection this semester we are very fortunate to have a special guest lecturer the woman who literally wrote the book on the borg admiral kathryn janeway
thank you commander im glad to be here a question already cadet
i suppose it could wait until after class admiral
as they say in the temporal mechanics department theres no time like the present
in the year 2377 you aided the borg resistance movement known as unimatrix zero
sounds like someones been reading ahead
i thought you had a question cadet
yes maam when you informed the queen that you were going to liberate thousands of her drones could you describe the look on her face
admiral some of us were talking before class and we were curious how extensive was seven of nines involvement with unimatrix zero
id er prefer not to discuss seven of nine
yes maam sorry
excuse me
okay er who can tell me a little about nanotechnology
im sorry to pull you out of class admiral
did you see it
yes maam
and
it works
korath has agreed to the exchange
yes
but
hes insisting on handing it over to you personally
ill be there as soon as i can good work ensign paris
hello tuvok
the light
oh im sorry
i know you
thats right im your friend kathryn janeway remember
youre an impostor
no tuvok its me
admiral janeway visits on sunday today is thursday logic dictates that you are not who you claim to be
how are you
i am close to completing my work
im glad to hear it
it is difficult with so many interruptions
im sorry would you like me to leave
you may stay
tuvok theres something i need to tell you its very important im going away and i may not see you again commander barclay and the doctor will continue to visit theyll bring you anything you need
the doctor comes on wednesdays commander barclays visits are erratic
goodbye tuvok
you must be the only doctor who still makes house calls
what are your symptoms
im perfectly fine
for thirty three years you fought me every time you were due for a physical now you ask me to give you one ahead of schedule
im taking a trip i just wanted to get our appointment out of the way before i left
thats all
thats all
hmm the good news is youre as healthy as you were the first day i examined you
well now thats out of the way have a seat we didnt get to talk much at the party
no i dont suppose we did
so hows married life
wonderful you should try it
oh i think its a little late for that marriage is for the young like your wife
i can only hope she ages as gracefully as you have i of course will be the same handsome hologram twenty years from now as i am today
ive been meaning to ask you are you familiar with a drug called chronexaline
weve been testing it at starfleet medical to determine if it can protect biomatter from tachyon radiation
and
its very promising why do you ask
i need two thousand milligrams by tomorrow afternoon
why
thats classified will you get it for me
of course admiral youll have it by oh nine hundred
thank you
download complete
this should be everything you need
the shuttle
waiting for you at the oakland shipyard i wish youd let me come with you
sorry reg but this is my mission besides if you leave there wont anyone to teach those eager young cadets about the borg
oh i made you some fresh tea for the trip not that replicated stuff
thank you for everything i wouldnt have been able to do this without you
oh dont remind me
any final words of advice for your old captain wait dont tell me im being impulsive i havent considered all the consequences its too risky thanks for the input but ive got to do what i think is right
i know it wasnt easy living all these years without her chakotay but when im through things might be better for all of us trust me
tom tom
im sleeping
its time
for what
ill give you one guess
paris to
paris to sickbay its time
relax mister paris can she stand
affirmative
then i suggest you report to sickbay
what about belanna
her too
right of course maybe we should take the transporter hey wait for me
hmm
what do you mean by hmm
youre going to have a very healthy baby but not tonight
tell me youre joking
youre experiencing false labour lieutenant
again
as i explained the last time its a common occurrence especially among klingons
i want this thing out of me now
misdirected rage another common occurrence among klingons
cant you induce
i wouldnt recommend it
if this keeps happening well never get any sleep
you think its bad now
when
oh four hundred
how many false alarms does that make
three that we know of
that baby is as stubborn as her mother
harrys starting a pool to see who can guess the actual date and time of birth
tell him to put me down for next friday twenty three hundred hours anything else
crewman chells asked about taking over in the mess hall full time
neelix left some pretty big pots and pans to fill does mister chell feel hes up to the challenge
apparently so hes prepared a sample menu
plasma leek soup chicken warp core don bleu
if his cookings as bad as his puns were in trouble
oh i dont know i wouldnt mind giving his red alert chili a try feel like having lunch
id love to but ive already made plans rain check
absolutely
whats all this
a picnic according to my research this is an appropriate third date
you didnt have to go to this much trouble
if this makes you uncomfortable i could prepare a less elaborate meal
no dont change a thing this is perfection
in the interest of fair play i should inform you that mister kim has never defeated me at kaltoh
you shouldve listened to me
kaltoh is as much a game of patience as it is of logic an experienced player will sometimes take several hours to decide his next move and in some cases even days may be necessary to
kaltoh
you beat him
congratulations
im sure it was just beginners luck sir id offer you a rematch but im due in astrometrics
he may have to go but im free and feeling lucky
if youll excuse me ensign
its just a game tuvok
ichebs an exceptionally bright young man did it occur to you that he might simply be a better player
my loss was the result of another lapse in concentration
i am detecting lower neuropeptide levels
as i suspected my condition is deteriorating
its a minor change we knew it would happen i simply have to increase your medication
thank you doctor
commander i understand your desire for privacy but maybe its time we informed the captain
i will inform her if and when the disorder begins to affect the performance of my duties
of course
your move
red grid three thirteen
tricky
hows brax
wonderful thanks for asking i know i can never replace his father but
i have no doubt the boy looks up to you
orange grid ten twelve i havent told anyone but im thinking of asking dexa to marry me
shed be wise to accept
thats enough of my love life how about yours
i dont have a love life
oh what about your relationship with commander chakotay
its your turn
actually its yours at least tell me how he liked the picnic
it was an enjoyable activity for both of us thank you for suggesting it
any time what is it
long range sensors are detecting extremely high neutrino emissions accompanied by an intermittent graviton flux approximately three light years away
a wormhole
im not sure ill need to conduct more scans
we can finish our game tomorrow
ill contact you at the usual time
the emissions are occurring at the centre of the nebula there appear to be hundreds of distinct sources
which could translate to hundreds of wormholes
the radiation is interfering with our sensors but if ensign kims enthusiasm turns out to be justified it would be the most concentrated occurrence of wormholes ever recorded
any idea where they lead
not yet but if just one of them leads to the alpha quadrant
who knows harry it might take us right into your parents living room
alter course mister paris ensign when you speak to your mother tell her we may need her to move the sofa
71 53 53 31 71 53 53 31 71 53
sorry if i pulled you away from something important sir but he wont let anyone near him and i thought you might
you did the right thing his conditions never been associated with violent behaviour
he seems more frustrated than violent
long range sensors have detected no trace her disappearance remains a mystery i am deeply concerned
what are you concerned about tuvok
her disappearance
whose
53 31 71 53
hes been repeating those same numbers over and over again 53 31 71 it might be a stardate
stardate 53317 if my memory files are accurate that was the day captain janeway was abducted by the kellidians is that who youre talking about tuvok captain janeway
her disappearance remains a mystery
no you solved that mystery tuvok you rescued the captain and brought her back to voyager safe and sound remember
i am deeply concerned deeply concerned
do you think if the admiral paid him a visit showed him that she was all right
unfortunately shes out of town right now im not sure when shell be back
shes never coming back her disappearance remains a mystery im deeply concerned deeply concerned
voyager to pathfinder come in pathfinder
doctor what a pleasant surp oh ive forgotten about our golf game again havent i
relax reg its not until next week im here because i need to get in touch with admiral janeway
oh shes out of town
i know did she tell you where she was going
er im afraid it it never came up i mean is something wrong
im not sure i paid a visit to tuvok this morning he seemed to think that she was in some sort of danger
well you know better than anyone how confused tuvok can get
yes but ive been worried about the admiral too
why
two days ago she asked me for a large quantity of an experimental medication when i asked her why she needed it she said it was classified
then you shouldnt be telling me about it should you
i spoke to director okaro at starfleet intelligence he assured me that the admiral hasnt been involved in any classified work since she began teaching at the academy
you know how sneaky these intelligence people can be maybe he was just trying to throw you off
maybe but still shes been talking for months about how excited she is to be teaching with you then just as the semester begins she goes away without even telling you where dont you find that a little strange
i im sure that there is a perfectly reasonable explanation doctor im sorry i have some ppapers to grade
youre stammering reg
ssso
i havent heard you do that in years i think you do know where she is
she is one of the most decorated officers in all of starfleet history and im im sure she can take care of herself
you wouldnt be saying that unless she was doing something dangerous
you are putting words in my mouth
tell me where she is reg
welcome to the house of korath admiral
i love what hes done with the place
kuvakor lijuq mah
petaq dabeq chumagh annoq
what was that about
he said your demeanour was disrespectful
i hope you told him i didnt mean to be rude
i told him if he didnt show you more respect i would break his arm
you are your mothers daughter
korath is waiting we should go in
sorry but this is where we part ways
excuse me
youre dismissed ensign
but admiral i really think that
i can take care of myself
with all due respect ive been working on this for six months and
and youve done an exemplary job but its over understood
yes maam
i happen to know your parents are anxious to spend some time with you take a few days leave go and see them
a cardassian disruptor ive modified it to emit a nadion pulse
impressive but thats not what ive come for
no youve come for something far more dangerous
where is it
somewhere safe
i went to a great deal of trouble to get you your seat on the high council now give me what you promised
ive scanned your shuttle it appears that youve made some interesting modifications your shield generator is of particular interest
its not for sale
then what you want isnt available either
we had an agreement
show the admiral out
maybe chell should add nebula soup to his menu
shields
holding
bridge to astrometrics
go ahead
any more data on those neutrino emissions
negative captain i still cant get a clear scan
distance to the centre
six million kilometres
what is it
im detecting a tritanium signature bearing three four two mark five five
whatever it is its too close
evasive manoeuvres
is it a ship
possibly
another tritanium signature right on top of us
tom
get us out of here now
vessel identified uss voyager we will pursue and assimilate
no they havent compromised our security let the vessel continue for now ill keep an eye on them
theres no evidence that the cube detected us
where is it now
approximately three light years away
how could they not have seen us we came within ten metres of their hull
the borg wouldnt knowingly risk a collision the radiation must have interfered with their sensors as well
if they cant detect us we should go back
i wouldnt recommend it my analysis of the tritanium signature suggests there were at least forty seven borg vessels inside the nebula
we cant just give up on those wormholes
oh yes we can
what if we try to modify
im sorry mister kim you may be the captain someday but not today
tom what are you doing when your shift ends
no plans why
ive been thinking you and i should have some fun one last adventure before you get too busy being a father
did you reserve some holodeck time
ive got a better idea
this is your idea of fun
itll work we just need to make a few modifications to the flyer
 we might as well just hand it over to the borg
how could that happen with the best pilot in the quadrant at the helm
nice try
if we go to the captain together shell be much more likely to approve my plan
i dont want her to approve it
wheres your sense of adventure
i left it in that nebula and im not going back for it
dont you want to find a way home
i am home harry
captain proton would never walk away from a mission like this
captain proton doesnt have a wife and a baby on the way
if youre here for my daily report its not complete
actually im here in an unofficial capacity i was wondering if youd like to get together again
to do what
well that all depends on your research would a quiet dinner be an appropriate fourth date
i believe it would be a more suitable fifth date
im willing to skip ahead if you are
youre fine aside from some minor inflammation around your biradial clamp let me know if it starts to bother you is there something else
do you remember three months ago when my cortical node shut down
how could i forget
you said it might be possible to remove the failsafe device that was causing the problem
has it been giving you trouble again
no but ive reconsidered your offer to extract it
ive been hoping you would
you said it would require several surgeries
actually in anticipation of your change of heart ive been studying the problem in more detail i now believe i can reconfigure the microcircuitry with a single procedure youll be free to experience the full ranges of emotions everything from a hearty belly laugh to a good cry
how soon can you do it
today if youd like
my shift ends at eighteen hundred hours
its a date speaking of dates once the failsafe is gone youll be free to pursue more intimate relationships
im aware of that
if you decide you need help with that aspect of your humanity im always at your disposal
i appreciate that
really
yes but i already have all the help i need
ah of course youll undoubtedly be running more simulations with the chakotay hologram
no actually ill see you at eighteen hundred hours
maktah hoon janeway takt
ive reconsidered your offer
i thought you might
ill give you the shield emitter but not until ive inspected the device youre offering to make sure its genuine
you question my honour
if you were honourable you wouldnt have changed the terms of our agreement show it to me or im leaving
this will do just fine
stop her
computer deploy armour
lay in a course for these coordinates
what do you want
youll pay for your deceit ghuycha the house of korath wont rest until youve drowned in your own blood
id love to stay and chat but im on a tight schedule
computer warp six
approaching designated coordinates
all stop
warning vessel approaching vector one two one mark six
harry and people are always saying that space is so big
lower your shields admiral prepare for transport im taking you into custody
you have no grounds to take me into custody captain
reg told the doctor everything and the doctor told me now please admiral stand down
on one condition you let me explain why im doing this
you have no idea what the consequences would be
i know what the consequences are if we do nothing so do you i have a chance to change all that
if starfleet command knew what you were trying to do
you havent told them
the doctor and i decided to keep things in the family
what about your crew
i told them i needed to take you back to starfleet medical because youd contracted a rare disease
i hope it isnt terminal
no but it has been known to affect judgment
i know what im doing harry
do you can you say with absolute certainty that itll work because if you cant even if it werent a violation of every rule in the book it would still be far too risky what
im remembering a young ensign who wanted to fly into a borginfested nebula just to explore the remote possibility that we might find a way home
if i remember correctly you stopped me
we didnt know then what we know now
our technology may have advanced but
im not talking about technology im talking about people people who werent as lucky as you and me you said you and the doctor wanted to keep things in the family but our familys not complete any more is it im asking you to trust my judgment harry one last time
am i early
no youre right on time something wrong with the door
i didnt think it would be discreet to be seen carrying flowers to the first officers quarters
your research i should put these in water
ive been told that anticipation of the first kiss is often uncomfortable i wanted to alleviate the tension
that was very considerate of you what about the second kiss
id have to check the database it may indicate
senior officers report to the bridge
next time we deactivate the comm system
what is it
judging from the tachyon emissions some sort of temporal rift
hows it being generated
thats what were trying to figure out
if starfleet command finds out i had anything to do with this theyll demote me back to ensign
you worry too much harry its turning you grey
propulsions online plasma flows stable this device of koraths it produces too much tachyokinetic energy it could burn itself out by the time you get where youre going you wouldnt be able to get back
i always assumed it was a one way trip
youre sure i cant talk you out of this right stupid question
kim to the rhode island one to beam back
computer activate the chronodeflector
deploy armour
unable to comply ablative generator is offline
evasive pattern beta six open a channel to the rhode island
harry im under attack how fast can you get back here
im detecting nadion discharges on the other side of the rift
weapons fire
its possible the signature appears to be klingon
red alert
stand by for transport admiral
you know where im going harry and its not to your ship
your structural integrity is failing
just get these klingons off my tail computer activate the tachyon pulse and direct it to these spatial and temporal coordinates
theres a vessel coming through the rift
klingon
no federation
were being hailed
on screen
recalibrate your deflector to emit an antitachyon pulse you have to seal that rift
captain a klingon vessel is coming through
close the rift in case you didnt notice i outrank you captain now do it
i did what you asked now tell me what the hell is going on
ive come to bring voyager home
welcome aboard
its good to be back
fresh coffee
would you like a cup
no i gave it up years ago i only drink tea now i told the curator at the museum that if he wanted to make the ready room more authentic he should always keep a steaming pot of coffee on the desk
voyagers in a museum
voyager is a museum on the grounds of the presidio on a clear morning you can see alcatraz from here
you made it back to earth
unfortunately our favourite cup took a bit of a beating along the way it was damaged during a battle with the fen domar
who
youll run into them in a few years
you know what i shouldnt be listening to details about the future
oh the almighty temporal prime directive take my advice its less of a headache if you just ignore it
youve obviously decided to or you wouldnt be here
a lots happened to me since i was you
well im still me and this is still my ship so no more talk about whats going to happen until i decide otherwise understood
all right lets talk about the past three days ago you detected elevated neutrino emissions in a nebula in grid nine eight six you thought it might be a way home you were right ive come to tell you to take voyager back to that nebula
it was crawling with borg
ive brought technology thatll get us past them oh i dont blame you for being sceptical but if you cant trust yourself who can you trust
for the sake of argument lets say i believe everything youre telling me the future you come from sounds pretty good voyagers home im an admiral there are ways to defend against the borg my ready room even gets preserved for posterity
so why would you want to tamper with such a rosy timeline to answer that id have to tell you more than you want to know but suffice it to say if you dont do what im suggesting its going to take you another sixteen years to get this ship home and there are going to be casualties along the way i know exactly what youre thinking
youve also become a telepath
i used to be you remember youre asking yourself is she really who she says she is or is this some sort of deception for all you know i could be a member of species 8472 in disguise have your people examine my shuttle tell them to take a close look at the weapons systems and the armour technology in the meantime the doctor can confirm my identity
my scans of the admirals cerebral cortex turned up something interesting
what is it
im not sure ive never seen this kind of implant before
alien technology
the microcircuitry has a starfleet signature
of course it does
admiral
you invented it twelve years ago from my perspective
im sorry admiral i didnt realise
what that i was eavesdropping i may be old but my hearings still excellent thanks to your exemplary care over the years
so this implant im going to invent what does it do
its a synaptic transceiver it allows me to pilot a vessel equipped with a neural interface
fascinating tell me what other extraordinary breakthroughs am i going to make
doctor
sorry captain but you cant blame a hologram for being curious
just finish your report
yes maam my scans indicate the two of you are genetically identical the admiral is you approximately twenty six years from now
hello seven
the technology aboard the admirals ship is impressive much of it appears to have been designed to defend against the borg
could we install these systems on voyager
the stealth technology is incompatible but i believe we can adapt the armour and weapons
well captain
do it
computer begin regeneration cycle
seven of nine tertiary adjunct of unimatrix zero one its been too long
what do you want
do i need a reason to visit a friend
were not friends
no were more than that were family and while were on the subject of old friends i see that voyager has just gotten a visitor and shes come from the future tell me why
you may be able to communicate with me while im regenerating but im no longer a drone i dont answer to you
ive extrapolated voyagers trajectory i know that youre returning to the nebula i suggest you alter course
why should we comply
youve always been my favourite seven in spite of their obvious imperfections i know how much you care for the voyager crew so ive left them alone imagine how youd feel if i were forced to assimilate them
voyager is no threat to the collective we simply want to return to the alpha quadrant
ive no objection to that but if you try to enter my nebula again ill destroy you
warning regeneration cycle incomplete
her cortical node was exposed to a lowenergy em surge it could have been much worse
it was the borg queen she wanted to make sure id be able to deliver a message she said shed assimilate voyager if we attempted to reenter the nebula
why is it so important to her
it doesnt matter shes not going to be able to make good on her threat
i wish i shared your confidence
you would if youd had as much experience with the queen as i have
it was one thing to attempt this when we thought it was a secret but if the borg are monitoring us
theres no guarantee they wont try to assimilate voyager even if we dont go back into the nebula
is that supposed to be reassuring
im not saying the borg arent dangerous but from my perspective theyre thirty years behind the times
we shouldnt push our luck
lucks not going to have anything to do with it i know you dont want to hear too much about the future but lets just say i ran into the borg a few more times before i made it home if i hadnt developed technology and tactics that could defeat them i wouldnt be standing here today
well maintain course for the nebula but well stay at red alert and i want continuous scans for borg activity
i heard what happened are you all right
im fine
because if you need time to rest i am in charge of the duty roster
it would be inappropriate to allow our personal relationship to affect your command decisions
youre right this is a time to keep things professional report
theres no sign of borg activity within a ten light year radius
thats good news crewman
yes sir but we shouldnt underestimate the collective
the admiral seems confident we can make it past them
captain janeway is more cautious
our chances would be good with one kathryn janeway on the bridge but with two id bet on this ship any day if we do make it back to earth what are your plans
i assume starfleet will want to debrief me and then i suppose ill attempt to find a useful position somewhere you
i dont know yet either but wherever i end up im going to make sure its in transporter range of you
i dont want this whole system crashing because of one faulty relay install new ones
yes maam
and i need an update on the inductor capacitance
yes lieutenant
belanna
shouldnt you be on the bridge
is there something wrong with the pilot requesting a systems report from the chief engineer
the last report i got said the comm system was working perfectly
okay you caught me im checking up on you
im fine
your back
im ignoring it
well i would offer to give you a massage but then everybody would want one
you know for a starfleet fly boy youre pretty sweet
so hows it going
this armour technology that the admiral brought its incredible i hate to sound like harry but we might actually make it this time
well you dont seem too happy about that
oh im happy its just that id actually gotten used to the idea of raising our daughter on voyager and now i might end up delivering her at starfleet medical instead of sickbay
that wouldnt be so bad would it
not as long as youre with me and i want the doctor i dont want some stranger
you would have to take him offline to keep him away
if we do make it home where do you think well live
well we could always stay with my parents for a while youre right bad idea
of course it probably doesnt matter to you anyway you fly boys are all the same youll probably take the first piloting assignment that comes along and leave me home to change the diapers
not a chance
bridge to engineering
go ahead captain
deploy armour
yes maam
armour integrity at ninety seven percent
tuvok
integrity holding at ninety percent
maintain course
theyre looking for ways to adapt
port armour integrity down to fifty percent forty percent
mister paris attack pattern alpha one target the lead cube and fire transphasic torpedoes
target the second cube
distance to the centre
less than one hundred thousand kilometres
what the hell is it
mister paris alter course to enter the aperture at coordinates three four six by four two
belay that i asked you a question what is it
the road home
its more than that its a transwarp hub
you once told me there were only six of them in the galaxy
thats correct
you knew this was here but you didnt tell me about it why
ill answer all your questions once were back in the alpha quadrant
take us out of the nebula
captain
you heard me
i gave you an order lieutenant proceed to the aperture
this is my bridge admiral and ill have you removed if necessary take us out
aye captain
this hub connects with thousands of transwarp conduits with end points in all four quadrants it allows the collective to deploy vessels almost anywhere in the galaxy within minutes
of all the borgs tactical advantages this could be the most significant
its no wonder the queen didnt want us in that nebula
so how do we destroy it
the structure is supported by a series of interspatial manifolds if we could disable enough of them theoretically the hub would collapse
this is a waste of time the shielding for those manifolds is regulated from the central nexus by the queen herself you might be able to damage one of them maybe two but by the time you moved onto the third shed adapt
there may be a way to bring them down simultaneously
from where inside the hub voyager would be crushed like a bug
what about taking the conduit back to the alpha quadrant and then destroying the structure from the other side
this hub is here theres nothing in the alpha quadrant but exit apertures while youre all standing around dreaming up fantasy tactical scenarios the queen is studying her scans of our armour and weapons and shes probably got the entire collective working on a way to counter them so take the ship back into that nebula and go home before its too late
find a way to destroy that hub lets take a walk
i want to know why you didnt tell me about this
because i remember how stubborn and selfrighteous i used to be i figured you might try to do something stupid
we have an opportunity to deal a crippling blow to the borg it could save millions of lives
i didnt spend the last ten years looking for a way to get this crew home earlier so you could throw it all away on some intergalactic goodwill mission
maybe we should go back to sickbay
why so you can have me sedated
so i can have the doctor reconfirm your identity i refuse to believe ill ever become as cynical as you
am i the only one experiencing déjà vu here
what are you talking about
seven years ago you had the chance to use the caretakers array to get voyager home instead you destroyed it
i did what i knew was right
you chose to put the lives of strangers ahead of the lives of your crew you cant make the same mistake again
you got voyager home which means i will too if it takes a few more years then thats
seven of nine is going to die
what
three years from now shell be injured on an away mission shell make it back to voyager and die in the arms of her husband
husband
chakotay hell never be the same after sevens death and neither will you
if i know whats going to happen i can avoid it
seven isnt the only one between this day and the day i got voyager home i lost twenty two crew members and then of course theres tuvok
what about him
youre forgetting the temporal prime directive captain
the hell with it
fine tuvok has a degenerative neurological condition that he hasnt told you about theres a cure in the alpha quadrant but if he doesnt get it in time
even if you alter voyagers route limit your contact with alien species youre going to lose people but im offering you a chance to get all of them home safe and sound today are you really going to walk away from that
your concern is appreciated captain but premature it will be several years before the symptoms become serious until then the doctor can manage my condition with medication
is it true what the admiral said that theres a cure in the alpha quadrant
it is called a faltorvoh and it requires a mind meld with another vulcan
what about the other vulcans on voyager
none of them are compatible
but members of your family are if you knew that returning to the alpha quadrant was your only chance for recovery why didnt you object when i asked you to help find a way to destroy the hub
my sense of logic isnt impaired yet if we succeed millions of lives will be saved
what about your life
to quote ambassador spock the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few
i appreciate your candour admiral but captain janeway is my commanding officer i wont disobey her
im not asking you to i simply want you to tell her that in your opinion destroying the hub is too risky the cost too high
i cant do that
even if it means avoiding the consequences i mentioned
now that i know about those consequences theyre no longer a certainty but even if they were my death would be a small price to pay for the destruction of the transwarp network
i have known you for a long time seven longer than youve known yourself you are thinking that collapsing the network is an opportunity to atone for atrocities you participated in while you were a drone its time to let go of the past and start thinking about your future
my future is insignificant compared to the lives of the people wed be saving
youre being selfish
selfish im talking about helping others
strangers in a hypothetical scenario im talking about real life your colleagues your friends people who love you imagine the impact your death would have on them
excuse me admiral i have work to complete
once inside wed fire a spread of transphasic torpedoes
theyd be programmed to detonate simultaneously
if the torpedoes penetrate the shielding the conduits should begin to collapse in a cascade reaction in order to avoid the shock wave wed have less than ten seconds to exit the hub
a long time ago i made a decision that stranded this crew in the delta quadrant i dont regret that decision but i didnt know all of you then and voyager was just a starship its much more than that now its become our home i know i could order you to carry out this plan and none of you would hesitate for a second but im not going to do that you know the crewmen who work under you and you know what your own hearts are telling you so were not going to attempt this unless everyone in this room agrees no one will think less of you if you dont
captain
go ahead harry
i think its safe to say that no one on this crew has been more obsessed with getting home than i have but when i think about everything weve been through together maybe its not the destination that matters maybe its the journey and if that journey takes a little longer so we can do something we all believe in i cant think of any place id rather be or any people id rather be with
to the journey
hear hear
to the journey
coffee black
i thought you gave it up
ive decided to revive a few of my old habits
oh what else besides the coffee
oh well i used to be much more idealistic i took a lot of risks ive been so determined to get this crew home for so many years that i think i forgot how much they loved being together and how loyal they were to you its taken me a few days to realise it this is your ship your crew not mine i was wrong to lie to you to think i could talk you out of something youd set your mind to
you were only trying to do what you thought was right for all of us
well youve changed my mind about that and id like to help you carry out your mission maybe together we can increase our odds
maybe we can do more than that theres got to be a way to have our cake and eat it too
we cant destroy the hub and get voyager home
are you absolutely sure about that
there might be a way i considered it once but it seemed too risky
that was before you decided to revive your old habits
i dont know why i ever gave this up
its about time im not getting any younger you know
youre sure you want to do this
no but voyager isnt big enough for both of us
good luck admiral
you too captain im glad i got to know you again
any word from the admiral
we lost contact as soon as she entered the hub
did the borg give her any trouble
her vessel was scanned by several cubes but none approached her sir
are we keeping things professional again today
yes commander
youre not joking are you
no
whats wrong
nothing im just busy
i think ive gotten to know you a little better than that
id prefer it if you didnt speak to me as though were on intimate terms
we are on intimate terms
not any more
what the hell is going on
ive decided to alter the parameters of our relationship
you mind telling me why
we both have dangerous occupations its possible one of us could be seriously injured or worse i believe its best to avoid emotional attachments
maybe you can just flip some borg switch and shut down your emotions but i cant
i suggest you try it will make things less difficult for you if any harm should come to me
why are you suddenly so concerned about that is there something i should know
the admiral suggested that your feelings for me will cause you pain in the future i cant allow that to happen
seven any relationship involves risk and nobody can guarantee whats going to happen tomorrow not even an admiral from the future the only certainty is how we feel about each other here and now if you think im going to let you end this because of what might happen then you need to get to know me a little better
try to relax lieutenant
if you tell me to relax one more time im going to rip your holographic head off
i hope you dont intend to kiss your baby with that mouth
tell me this isnt another false alarm
this isnt another false alarm
i cant believe it
oh believe it
i might actually win
what
the baby pool i picked today fifteen hundred hours
im so glad i could accommodate yougt
dont celebrate yet klingon labour sometimes lasts several days  of course im sure that wont be the case here
bridge to lieutenant paris were ready to get underway
captain im afraid
go
but
no buts fly boy if this mission is going to succeed we need our best pilot at the helm dont worry the doctor will be here with me
is there a problem mister paris
on my way captain
lets get this show on the road
voyager has altered course current position spatial grid three six two trajectory one one two mark five
i dont know how you do it all those voices talking at once you must get terrible headaches if youre calling drones to assimilate me dont bother
i dont need drones to assimilate you
im not actually here your majesty im in your mind im
using a synaptic interface if i were you i wouldnt waste my time trying to trace the signal
for the moment its beyond your abilities
what do you want
to make a deal captain janeway thinks im here to help her destroy your transwarp network
thats beyond your abilities
oh i know that and i tried to explain it to my naive younger self but she wouldnt listen shes determined to bring down that hub
shell fail
yes but she has weapons that i brought from the future i believe youre familiar with them
transphasic torpedoes we will adapt
eventually but not before voyager does a great deal of damage im willing to tell you how to adapt to those weapons now
in exchange for what
send a cube to tractor voyager and drag them back to the alpha quadrant
youre asking me to believe that the incorruptible kathryn janeway would betray her own crew
not betray them save them from themselves i brought technology to help voyager get home but the captains arrogant selfrighteous and her officers are so blinded by loyalty that theyre prepared to sacrifice their lives just to deal a crippling blow to the borg
but youd never try to harm us
ive become a pragmatist in my old age all i want is to get that crew back to their families
you wish to ensure the wellbeing of your collective i can appreciate that ill help you but itll cost more than youre offering
what do you want
your vessel and its database
i told you ill show you how to adapt to their torpedoes
insufficient
if i let you assimilate technology from the future theres no telling how events would be altered
youre willing to alter the future by getting voyager home now
oh yes but theres a difference
do what all good pragmatists do admiral compromise
all right ill give you the shuttle after voyager arrives safely in the alpha quadrant
youve already lied to your younger self how do i know youre not lying to me
i guess youll just have to trust me
that wont be necessary you underestimate me admiral while weve been talking my drones have triangulated your signal
computer deactivate the interface deploy armour
very clever hiding right on my doorstep were you planning to attack us from inside the unicomplex not feeling talkative
you and i dont need words to understand each other
take us in
aye captain
voyager has entered aperture eight two three access transwarp corridor zero nine redirect vessels to intercept at subjunction
corridor nine voyager uss s zero zero nine transwarp transwarp intercept
must be something you assimilated
what have you done
i thought we didnt need words to understand each other
youve infected us with an neurolytic pathogen
just enough to bring chaos to order
the admirals succeeded captain the conduits shielding is destabilising
now mister tuvok
voyager will be destroyed
theyre ahead of the shock wave theyll survive captain janeway and i made sure of that its you who underestimated us
sphere six three four they can still hear my thoughts
i may have assimilated your pathogen but i also assimilated your armour technology
captain janeway is about to die if she has no future you will never exist and nothing that youve done here today will happen
what the hell is it
a transwarp aperture its less than a light year from earth
how many borg vessels
we cant get a clear reading but the graviton emissions are off the scale
i want every ship in range to converge on those coordinates now
yes sir
aft armour is down to six percent
hull breaches on decks six through twelve
i cant stay ahead of them captain
the armour is failing
wheres the nearest aperture
approximately thirty seconds ahead but it leads back to the delta quadrant
mister paris prepare to adjust your heading
yes maam
weve got eighteen ships in position nine more on the way
open a channel
open sir
this is admiral paris use all necessary force i repeat all necessary force
sir theres a vessel coming through
mister paris whats our position
right where we expect it to be
the transwarp network has been obliterated captain
well celebrate later mister tuvok
cease fire
we did it
were being hailed
on screen
sorry to surprise you next time well call ahead
welcome back
its good to be here
how did you
itll all be in my report sir
i look forward to it
thanks for your help admiral janeway
sickbay to the bridge
doctor to lieutenant paris theres someone here whod like to say hello
youd better get down there tom
yes maam
mister chakotay the helm
aye captain
set a course for home
where no man has gone before
doctor cochrane would be proud of you
i know the whole speech by heart whens it going to be ready to fly
let the paint dry first
no i mean the ship
not for a while it hasnt even been built yet you know that
how big will it be
pretty big
bigger than ambassador pointys ship
his name is soval and hes been very helpful and ive told you not to call him that jonathan
well billy cook said wed be flying at warp five by now if the vulcans hadnt kept things from us
well they have their reasons god knows what they are
drop your weapon i mean it
i dont understand a word youre saying but i guarantee you i know how to use this
the ventral plating team says theyll be done in about three days
be sure they match the colour to the nacelle housings
you planning to sit on the hull and pose for some postcards
maybe god shes beautiful
and fast warp four point five next thursday
neptune and back in six minutes lets take a look at the lateral sensor array
give me a second
slow down there those are the ports that buckled during the last test they need to be reinforced  great you scratched the paint
sorry orbital six
captain archer sir
go ahead
admiral forrest needs you at starfleet medical right away
who was chasing him
we dont know they were incinerated in the methane explosion and the farmers description was vague at best
how did they get here what kind of ship
they were using some kind of stealth technology were still analyzing our sensor logs
id like to see those logs
the klingons made it very clear they want us to expedite this
it happened on our soil
thats irrelevant
ambassador with all due respect we have a right to know whats going on here
you will be apprised of all pertinent information
and just who gets to decide whats pertinent information
admiral
jon i think you know everyone
not everyone
its a klingot
a klingon
whered he come from
oklahoma
a corn farmer named moore shot him with a plasma rifle says it was selfdefense
fortunately soval and i have maintained close contact with kronos since the incident occurred
kronos
its the klingons homeworld
this gentleman is some sort of a courier evidently he was carrying crucial information back to his people
when he was nearly killed by your farmer
ambassador soval thinks it would be best if we push off your launch until weve cleared this up
well isnt that a surprise youd think theyd have come up with something a little more imaginative this time
sarcasm aside captain the last thing your people need is to make an enemy of the klingon empire
if we hadnt convinced them to let us take klaangs corpse back to kronos earth would most likely be facing a squadron of warbirds by the end of the week
corpse is he dead
excuse me is that man dead
his autonomic system was disrupted by the blast but his redundant neural functions are
is he going to die
not necessarily
let me get this straight youre going to disconnect this man from life support even though he could live now wheres the logic in that
klaangs culture finds honour in death if they saw him like this hed be disgraced
theyre a warrior race they dream of dying in battle if you understood the complexities of interstellar diplomacy
so thats your diplomatic solution to do what they tell you pull the plug
your metaphor is crude but accurate
we may be crude but were not murderers youre not going to let them do this are you
the klingons have demanded that we return klaang immediately
admiral
we may need to defer to their judgement
weve been deferring to their judgement for a hundred years
jon
how much longer
until youve proven youre ready
ready to what
to look beyond your provincial attitudes and volatile nature
volatile you have no idea how much im restraining myself from knocking you on your ass these klingons theyre anxious to get their man back fine i can have my ship ready to go in three days well take him back home alive
this is no time to be imposing your ethical beliefs
dan
what about your crew your comm officers in brazil you havent selected a medical officer yet
three days thats all i need
admiral
weve been waiting for nearly a century ambassador this seems as good a time as any to get started
listen to me youre making a mistake
when your logic doesnt work you raise your voice youve been on earth too long
i had a feeling their approach wouldnt sit too well with you dont screw this up
i heard this platforms been approved for biotransport
i presume you mean fruits and vegetables
i mean armoury officers and helmsmen
i dont think im quite ready to have my molecules compressed into a data stream
they claim its safe
do they indeed well i certainly hope the captain doesnt plan on making us use it
dont worry from what im told he wouldnt even put his dog through this thing
this is ridiculous i asked for plasma coils and they sent me a case of valve sealant theres no chance i can have these weapons online in three days
were just taking a sick man back to his homeworld why do we need weapons
didnt you read the profile report on these klingons apparently they sharpen their teeth before they go into battle
no doubt mister tucker will reassure me that my equipment will be here tomorrow keep your shirt on lieutenant
is it me or does the artificial gravity seem a bit heavy
feels all right earth sea level
my father always kept it at point eight g he thought it put a little spring in his step
after being raised on cargo ships it mustve felt like you had lead in your boots when you got to earth
beautiful lock it off right there
i believe you missed a spot commander tucker ensign travis mayweather he just arrived
our space boomer
how fast have you gotten her
warp four well be going to four five as soon as we clear jupiter think you can handle it
four point five
pardon me but if i dont realign the deflector the first grain of space dust we come across will blow a hole through this ship the size of your fist
keep your shirt on lieutenant your equipmentll be here in the morning
ghlungit tak nekleet

tighten the back of your tongue krgltt
krgltt krgltt
keep trying youve almost got it  ill be right back
theres two more weeks before exams its impossible for me to leave now
youve got to have someone who can cover for you
if there was anyone else who could do what i do you wouldnt be so eager to have me on your space ship
hoshi
im sorry captain i owe it to these kids
i could order you
im on leave from starfleet remember you would have to forcibly recall me which would require a reprimand which would disqualify me from serving on an active vessel
i need someone with your ear
and youll have her in three weeks  whats that
klingon ambassador soval gave us a sampling of their linguistic database
i thought you said the vulcans were opposed to this
they are but we agreed to make a few compromises
what do you know about these klingons
not much an empire of warriors with eighty polyguttural dialects constructed on an adaptive syntax
turn it up
think about it youd be the first human to talk to these people do you really want someone else to do it
since when do we have vulcan science officers
since we needed their star charts to get to kronos
so we get a few maps and they get to put a spy on our ship
admiral forrest says we should think of her more as a chaperone
i thought the whole point of this was to get away from the vulcans
four days there four days back then shes gone in the meantime were to extend her every courtesy
i dont know id be more comfortable with porthos on the bridge
here we go come in
this confirms that i was formally transferred to your command at oh eight hundred hours reporting for duty
is there a problem
no sir
oh i forgot vulcan females have a heightened sense of smell i hope porthos isnt too offensive to you
ive been trained to tolerate offensive situations
i took a shower this morning how about you captain
im sorry this is commander charles tucker the third subcommander tpol
trip im called trip
ill try to remember that
while you may not share our enthusiasm about this mission i expect you to follow our rules whats said in this room and out on that bridge is privileged information i dont want every word i say being picked apart the next day by the vulcan high command
my reason for being here is not espionage my superiors simply asked me to assist you
your superiors dont think we can flush a toilet without one of you to assist us
i didnt request this assignment captain and you can be certain that when the missions over ill be as pleased to leave this ship as youll be to have me go  if theres nothing else
thatll be all
when zefram cochrane made his legendary warp flight ninety years ago and drew the attention of our new friends the vulcans we realised that we werent alone in the galaxy today were about to cross a new threshold for nearly a century weve waded ankledeep in the ocean of space now its finally time to swim  the warp five engine wouldnt be a reality without men like doctor cochrane and henry archer who worked so hard to develop it so its only fitting that henrys son jonathan archer will command the first starship powered by that engine  rather than quoting doctor cochrane i think we should listen to his own words from the dedication ceremony for the warp five complex thirty two years ago
take her out mister mayweather straight and steady
how are we doing trip
ready when you are
prepare for warp
course laid in sir request permission to get underway
the coordinates are off by point two degrees
thank you lets go
wheres klaang
the humans have him
did you lose anyone else
two of my soldiers were killed one of them was a friend can you prevent it
our agreement doesnt provide for correcting mistakes recover the evidence
i will i promise you when will we speak again
dont be concerned with when
love what youve done with the place
those are immunocytic gel worms try not to shake them
whatd you think of earth
intriguing i especially liked the chinese food have you ever tried it
ive lived in san francisco all my life
anatomically you humans are somewhat simplistic but what you lack biologically you make up for with your charming optimism not to mention your egg drop soup be very careful with that
whats in there
an altarian marsupial their droppings contain the greatest concentration of regenerative enzymes found anywhere
their droppings
if youre going to try to embrace new worlds you must try to embrace new ideas thats why the vulcans initiated the interspecies medical exchange theres a lot to be learned
im sorry i had to take you away from your programme but our doctors havent even heard of a klingon
please no apologies what better time to study human beings than when theyre under pressure its a rare opportunity and your klingon friend ive never had a chance to examine a living one before
ensign mayweather tells me well be to kronos in about eighty hours any chance hell be conscious by then
theres a chance hell be conscious within the next ten minutes just not a very good one
eighty hours doctor if he doesnt walk off this ship on his own two feet he doesnt stand much of a chance
ill do the best i can optimism captain
youre upside down ensign
yes sir
care to explain why
when i was a kid we called it the sweet spot every ships got one
sweet spot
its usually about halfway between the gravgenerator and the bow plate grab a hold of the hatch no on either side now push off push off
wow
it takes practice ever slept in zero g
slept
its just like being back in the womb
the captain tells me youve been to trillius prime
it took the fourth fifth and sixth grades to get there ive also been to draylax and both the denebian moons
ive only been to one inhabited planet besides earth nothing there but dustdwelling ticks ive heard the women on draylax have
three its true
you know that firsthand
firsthand secondhand thirdhand
i guess growing up a boomer has its advantages
got an empty seat here commander
sorry dinner with the boss tonight
the grand canyon
no
big sur aquarium
sightseeing was not one of my assignments
all work and no play everyone should get out for a little fun now and then
all our recreational needs are provided at the compound
come in
you shouldve started without me
sit down tpol tells me shes been living at the vulcan compound in sausalito
no kidding i lived a few blocks from there when i first joined starfleet great parties at the vulcan compound
it might be a little easier using your fingers
vulcans dont touch food with their hands
cant wait to see you tackle the spare ribs
dont worry we know youre a vegetarian
looks delicious tell chef i said thanks
of course sir
you humans claim to be enlightened yet you still consume the flesh of animals
grandma taught me never to judge a species by their eating habits
enlightened may be too strong a word but if youd been on earth fifty years ago i think youd be impressed by what weve gotten done
you have yet to embrace either patience or logic you remain impulsive carnivores
yeah how about war disease hunger pretty much wiped em out in less than two generations i wouldnt call that small potatoes
it remains to be seen whether humanity will revert to its baser instincts
well we used to have cannibals on earth who knows how far well revert lucky this isnt a long mission
human instinct is pretty strong you cant expect us to change overnight
with proper discipline anythings possible
warp four point three sir
not much of a change
i dont know does anybody else feel that
feel what
those vibrations like little tremors
youre imagining it
bring us to four four ensign
there what do you call that
the deflectors sequencing its perfectly normal
perhaps youd like to go to your quarters and lie down
ponfo mirann
i was instructed to speak english during this voyage and id appreciate it if youd respect that
its easy to get a little jumpy when youre travelling at thirty million kilometres a second should be old hat in a weeks time archer
this is doctor phlox captain our patient is regaining consciousness
on my way hoshi

whats wrong
the translator its not locking onto his dialect the syntax wont align

tell him were taking him home

im not sure but i think hes saying something about eating the afterlife
try the translator again
im going to need to run what weve got through the phonetic processor
majoa blmohgu
he says his wife has grown ugly im sorry captain im doing the best i can
excuse me his prefrontal cortex is hyperstimulated i doubt he has any idea what hes saying
hljoloaoquna
i think the doctors right captain unless stinky boots has something to do with all this
oaoguna
thats the warp reactor again right
oaoguna
bridge report
weve dropped out of warp sir main power is
were losing power on all decks
i think i just saw something off the starboard bow
what
i dont know it might have just been the sensors going down
auxiliary power should have kicked in by now do you know how to tell him to shut up
shut up
you may have to sedate him i need to get to the bridge
captain theres someone here
crewman
suliban
weve got state of the art sensors why the hell didnt we detect them
mister reed thought he detected something right before we lost power
the starboard sensor logs recorded a spatial disturbance
looks more like a glitch
those werent glitches in sickbay
i want a complete analysis of that disturbance where do we stand on weapons
i still have to tune the targeting scanners
whatre you waiting for
captain
the klingon seemed to know who they were see if you can translate what he said
right away
captain theres no way you could have anticipated this im sure ambassador soval will understand
youre the science officer why dont you help trip with that analysis
the astrometric computer in san francisco will be far more effective
were not going to san francisco so make do with what weve got here
youve lost the klingon your mission is over
i didnt lose the klingon he was taken and im going to find out who took him
how do you plan to do that space is very big captain a shadow on your sensors wont help you find them this is a foolish mission
come with me
im not interested in what you think about this mission so take your vulcan cynicism and bury it along with your repressed emotions
your reaction to this situation is a perfect example of why your species should remain in its own star system
ive been listening to you vulcans tell us what not to do all my entire life i watched my father work his ass off while your scientists held back just enough information to keep him from succeeding he deserved to see that launch you may have life spans of two hundred years we dont
you are going to be contacting starfleet to advise them of our situation
no im not and neither are you now get the hell out there and make yourself useful
what have you found doctor
mister klaang was right about one thing hes a suliban but unless im mistaken hes no ordinary one
meaning
his dna is suliban but his anatomy has been altered look at this lung five bronchial lobes you see it should only have three and look at the alveoli clusters theyve been modified to process different kinds of atmospheres
are you saying hes some kind of a mutant
yes i suppose i am but this was no accident no freak of nature this man was the recipient of some very sophisticated genetic engineering watch this subcutaneous pigment sacs a biomimetic garment and the eyes are my favorite compound retinas he most likely saw things even your sensors couldnt detect
its not in their genome
no certainly not the suliban are no more evolved than humans it is very impressive work though ive never seen anything quite like it
how about this
its just background noise your sensors arent capable of isolating plasma decay
how can you be so damn sure what our sensors can do
vulcan children play with toys that are more sophisticated
you know some people say that you vulcans do nothing but patronise us but if they were here now if they could see how far youre bending over backwards to help me theyd eat their words
your captains mission was to return the klingon to his people he no longer has the klingon
i realize hes only a simple earthling but did it ever occur to you that he might know what hes doing its no secret starfleet hasnt been around too long god knows you remind us of that every chance you get but does that mean the man whos been put in charge of this mission doesnt deserve our support then again loyaltys an emotion isnt it
any luck
not really
my analysis of the spatial disturbance mister reed saw indicates a stealth vessel with a tricyclic plasma drive
if we can figure out the decay rate of their plasma well be able to find their warp trail
unfortunately your sensors were not designed to measure plasma decay
are you sure its safe to stand so close to that
whatve you got
ive managed to translate most of what klaang said but none of it makes sense
nothing about the suliban
nope
does that name ring a bell to you
theyre a somewhat primitive species from sector three six four one but theyve never posed a threat
well they have now did he say anything about earth
the words not even in their database its all there there were only four words i couldnt translate probably just proper nouns
jelik sarin rigel tholia anything sound familiar tpol
rigel is a planetary system approximately fifteen light years from our present position
why the hesitation
according to the navigational logs salvaged from klaangs ship rigel ten was the last place he stopped before crashing on your planet
why do i get the feeling you werent going to share that little piece of information
i wasnt authorised to reveal the details of our findings
the next time i learn youre withholding something youre going to spend the rest of this voyage confined to some very cramped quarters understood archer to helm
mayweather
go into the vulcan star charts and find a system called rigel then set a course for the tenth planet
yes sir
where is it where is it
du bogh i dont know
were not going to harm you tell me where it is
i dont know
are you certain hes telling the truth
absolutely certain the drugs are working
hovme luphom pente dao enterprise dahjaj did you leave it on your ship is it on enterprise
du boqh guchi dont know what youre looking for
biheqh rigel wotul what were you doing on rigel ten
i was sent to meet someone
doh who
majqa rot sarin poh ni a suliban female named sarin
dah sarin sajkogh and what did sarin give you
rqgh nothing
keep him alive while im gone
as soon as weve tied down well be descending into the trade complex it has thirtysix levels
your translators have been programmed for rigelian however youll encounter numerous other species many of them are known to be impatient with newcomers none of them have seen a human before you have a tendency to be gregarious i suggest you try to restrain that tendency
you forgot to warn us about drinking the water
doctor phlox isnt concerned with the food and water but he does caution against intimate contact
the vulcans told us klaang was a courier if he was there to get something then whoever gave it to him might know why he was taken it was only a few days ago a seven foot klingon doesnt go unnoticed
what in the world
its nothing that concerns us
five or six days ago do you realise how much traffic we process in a single day
this was a one man klingon scout ship
what species are you
humans were called humans
elkan nine raise your approach vector by point two radiants it was seven days ago a ktoch class vessel
does it say who he was here to see
what is says is that he arrived at docking port six and was given a level one biohazard clearance
you dont seem to be very interested in what people do here
our visitors value their privacy it wouldnt be very tusoropko tuprova pro the business theyre in
its all right rigelian uses a pronominal base the translators just reprocessing the syntax
do you have any records of a suliban vessel coming in around the same time
suliban i dont know that word your device must still be malfunctioning
would you like to meet them i can arrange it
is this where you saw klaang
ill show you where but first you should enjoy yourselves which one would you prefer
we should get going
are those real butterflies or some kind of holograms
sir
yes absolutely right
tpol to archer
go ahead
hey
central security claims to have no record of klaang but they told me about an enclave on level nineteen where klingons have been known to go something about live food
where on level nineteen
the easternmost subsection by the geothermal shafts
ill meet you there as soon as i can archer out
what are you doing leave the kid alone
dont get involved
do you see what shes doing hes going to suffocate
theyre lorillians before the age of four they can only breathe methyloxide the mother is simply weaning her son
couldve fooled me
humans cant refrain from drawing conclusions you should learn to objectify other cultures so you know when to interfere and when not to
gentlemen gentlemen perhaps you would prefer to watch the interspecies performance
you dont know anything about klaang do you
of course i do but theres no reason to hurry
interspecies performance
lieutenant this man has no intention of helping us
perhaps another time
i cant believe we fell for that
we are explorers
isnt an enclave supposed to have people
enclave can mean a lot of things
tpol said something about live food i dont see any restaurants
hello excuse me
haquj jeg they looked klingon to me
archer to tpol tpol come in
maybe we should get back to where there are more people
there are plenty of people right here
stay behind me
youre looking for klaang why
who the hell are you
my name is sarin tell me about the people who took klaang off your ship
i was hoping you could tell me they looked a lot like your friends outside
where were you taking him
how come you dont look like your friends
would you prefer i did
what id prefer is that you give me klaang back
so you could take him where
home we were just taking him home youd better be careful im a lot bigger than you are
if youre thinking about harming me id advise against it
what are you doing
why were you taking klaang home
you know under different circumstances i might be flattered by this but
thats never happened before
ive been given the ability to measure trust but it requires close contact
youre suliban
im a member of the cabal but not any longer the price of evolution was too high
evolution
some of my people are so anxious to improve themselves that theyve lost perspective
so you know im not lying to you now what
klaang was carrying a message to his people
how do you know that
i gave it to him
what kind of message
the suliban have been staging attacks within the klingon empire making it appear that one faction is attacking another klaang was bringing proof of this to his high council without that proof the empire could be thrown into chaos
why would the suliban want that
the cabal doesnt make decisions on its own theyre simply soldiers fighting a temporal cold war
temporal youve lost me
theyre taking orders from the distant future
what
we can help you find klaang but we dont have a starship youll have to take us with you
wheres your vessel
on the roof docking port three
this way
trip
find klaang
wheres the pod
over here
no its this way
come on lieutenant reed this is archer come in
youre breaking up cant read
were on the roof you need to get up here as quickly
as you can
weve been trying to reach you captain were back in the shuttle
ask him where they are this storms getting worse
captain whats your location the weather is definitely
great
like i said its back there
ive never seen lightning in a snowstorm before
the storms kicking up too much interference i cant isolate human biosigns they could be anywhere in the complex
try vulcan biosigns
i found her
get hoshi to the ship now
go
enterprise needs its captain give me the weapons
i said go
the starboard thrusters down
ignore it take us up
we need instructions
open a channel subcommander tpol to enterprise
go ahead
well be docking in four minutes have doctor phlox meet us in decon
acknowledged is someone wounded
the captain im taking command of enterprise
i cant do it
yes you can take her up straight and steady
damn
you cant be afraid of the wind learn to trust it
it shouldnt take more than a few moments
is this really necessary
the others scanned negative you two unfortunately were exposed to a protocystian spore ive loaded the appropriate decon gel into compartment b
tell mister mayweather to prepare to leave orbit
hows the captain
im treating his wound
will he be all right
eventually
correct me if im wrong but arent you just kind of an observer on this mission i dont remember anyone telling me you were a member of starfleet
my vulcan rank supersedes yours
apples and oranges this is an earth vessel youre in no position to take command
as soon as were through here ill contact ambassador soval hell speak to your superiors and im certain theyll support my authority in this situation
you must really be proud of yourself you can put an end to this mission while the captains still unconscious in sickbay you wont even have to look him in the eye
your precious cargo was stolen three suliban perhaps more were killed and captain archer has been seriously wounded it seems to me this mission has put an end to itself turn around
lets say youre right lets say we screwed up just like you always knew we would its still a pretty good bet that whoever blew that hole in the captains leg is connected somehow to the people who took klaang
i fail to see your point
captain archer deserves a chance to see this through if you knew him youd realise thats what hes about he needs to finish what he starts his daddy was the same way
you obviously share your captains belief that my people were responsible for impeding henry archers accomplishments
he only wanted to see his engine fly they never even gave him a chance to fail here you are thirty years later proving just how consistent you vulcans can be
very nice very nice your myofibres are fusing beautifully
how long have
less than six hours i thought it best to keep you sedated while the osmotic eel cauterized your wound
thanks
how are you doing captain
that depends whats been going on the last six hours
as your highest ranking officer i assumed command while you were incapacitated
are we underway  you didnt waste much time did you
is he fit to resume command
as long as he returns for more eel therapy tomorrow
how long before we get back to earth
earth sir
were currently tracking the suliban vessel that left rigel shortly after you were injured
you got their plasma decay rate
with mister tuckers assistance i modified the sensors you now have the resolution to detect their warp trail
what happened to this is a foolish mission
it is a foolish mission the suliban are clearly a hostile race with technology far superior to yours but as acting captain i was obligated to anticipate your wishes
as acting captain you couldve done whatever the hell you wanted to do
i should return to the bridge
dismissed
modifying the sensors was her idea sir
what are the symptoms of frostbite
your appendages blister peel and turn gangrenous
i think i have frostbite
let me see  doctor phlox may have to amputate
i never had to worry about frostbite in brazil
theyre getting too far ahead of us
match their speed
im not authorised to go beyond four four
engineering
mister tucker
would you please give the helmsman permission to go to warp four point five
its okay travis ill keep an eye on the engine
enterprise starlog captain jonathan archer april 16th 2151 weve been tracking the suliban ship for ten hours thanks to our science officer who came up with a way to tweak the sensors computer pause i save her life and now shes helping us with the mission one good turn deserves another doesnt sound very vulcan resume log i have no reason to believe that klaang is still alive but if what the suliban woman told me is true its crucial that we try to find him computer pause  have you ever known a vulcan to return a favour no neither have i resume log i still havent decided whether to ask subcommander tpol about this temporal cold war my instincts tell me not to trust her computer pause archer to tpol report
if youre feeling well enough to come to the bridge captain now would be a good time
its a gas giant
from the looks of it a class six or seven
class seven the suliban vessel dropped to impulse a few hours ago and altered course their new heading took them through its outer radiation belt
weve lost them
yes
move us in closer anything
the radiations dissipated their warp trail im only picking up fragments
you finished helping us
lieutenant run a spectral analysis of the fragments
theres too much distortion the decay rates dont even match
calculate the trajectory of each fragment
sir
you heard her recalibrate the sensor array narrow band short to mid range
aye sir
measure the particle density of the thermosphere
your instincts were right those fragments werent from one suliban ship
they were from fourteen and all within the last six hours i believe we have found what were looking for
how are your targeting scanners
aligned and ready sir
bring the weapons online and polarise the hull plating lay in a sixty degree vector were going in
did sarin give them anything
i dont know
what do you know
they followed us here
looking for klaang or for you
i dont know but i will destroy them before they locate the helix
we didnt plan to involve the humans or the vulcans not yet sarins message cannot reach kronos if the humans have it you must stop them
sensor resolutions falling off at about twelve kilometres
travis
im okay captain
our situation should improve were about to break through the cyclohexane layer
i wouldnt exactly call this an improvement
liquid phosphorous i wouldnt have expected that beneath a layer of cyclohexane
you might think about recommending seat belts when we get home
its just a little bad weather
weve got sensors
level off go to long range scans
im detecting two vessels bearing one one nine mark seven
put it up
impulse and warp engines
what kind of weapons
were too far away
sir im picking up something at three forty two mark twelve its a lot bigger
all sensors get whatever you can go tighter biosigns
over three thousand but i cant isolate a klingon if there is one
that was a particle weapon sir
bridge were taking
damage down here whats going on
just a little
trouble with the bad guys
i suggest we return to the phosphorous layer
take us up
captain
whatve you got
it appears to be an aggregate structure comprised of hundreds of vessels theyre held in place by an interlocking system of magnetic seals
there right there these bioreadings are not suliban
we cant be certain theyre klingon
even if it is klaang wed have a tough time getting him out of there
we could always try the transporting device
weve risked too much to bring him back inside out would the grappler work in a liquid atmosphere
i believe so
bring it online one more time mister mayweather
the ventral platings down
hold your position
the lead ships closing seven thousand metres six thousand
we should ascend
hold your position
one thousand metres forward platings offline
now mister reed
the ships in the launch bay
ask me another one
all right whats this
the pitch control
no thats the pitch control this is the guidance system
pitch control guidance system got it
the docking interface how do you deploy it
release the inertial clamps here here and here then initialize the coaxial ports
good wheres the auxiliary throttle
hmm its not this one
with all due respect to commander tucker im pretty sure i could fly this thing sir
i dont doubt it but i need you here
there thats it the auxiliary throttle
captain that charge contained a proximity sweep if we remain here theyre going to locate us
youre gonna have to speed this up a little travis
how complicated can it be up down forward reverse well figure it out
well be back before you know it have mayweather plot a course for kronos
theres a vulcan ship less than two days away its illogical to attempt this alone
i was beginning to think you understood why we have to do this alone
youll have other opportunities to demonstrate your independence
never put off til tomorrow
you both could be killed
am i sensing concern last time i checked that was considered an emotion
if anything happens to either of you the vulcan high command will hold me responsible
come in you finished
sir
this should reverse the polarity of any maglock within a hundred metres once youve set the sequence youll have five seconds one more thing
ah our new weapons
theyre called phase pistols they have two settings stun and kill it would be best not to confuse them
time to go the ship is yours
whats that
travis said not to worry about that panel
thats reassuring
hold on
that one was a lot closer
if we change our position theyll have to start from scratch
if we change our position the captain will have no way of finding us
i think were there
bring the docking interface online the coaxial ports
open
lets go
where is it it was right here
bank starboard ninety degrees
there you are
thats the upper support radius drop down right below it start a counter clockwise sweep a little more a little more  right there
stun seems to work
grab on to something
this is ridiculous if we dont move the ship captain archer wont have anything to look for when he gets back
were going to need that ear of yours move us away five kilometres
in what direction
any direction
this is going be easier than i thought its okay were getting you off this thing
i really dont want to have to carry you out of here you okay i think he gets the idea give him a hand
qutaw bob
be quiet
you tell him big guy
give me the box
thanks
get to the ship ill be right behind you
captain
it worked trip
where are you
still on the central core get klaang back to enterprise
what about you sir
get him to the ship you can come back for me
its going to be hard to isolate your biosigns so stay as far away from the suliban
as you can
believe me ill try
raqo jadich
i dont particularly like the way you smell either
majqa
i dont get it this is right where theyre supposed to be
the charges are getting closer again
another five kilometres lieutenant
at this rate the captainll never find us
wait a minute i think ive got something
amplify it
its commander tucker
all i hear is noise
its just a narrow notch in the midrange he says hes about to ignite his thruster exhaust
coordinates one fifty eight mark one three
laid in
ahead fifty kph  shaya tonat
youre welcome
two kilometres dead ahead
initiate docking procedures
im only picking up two biosigns one klingon one human
turn this ship around now
our mission is to return the klingon to his homeworld another rescue attempt could jeopardize that mission
the captain specifically told us to come back for him
as commanding officer its my job to interpret the captains orders
i just told you his orders whats there to interpret
captain archer may very well have told you to return for him later because he knew how stubborn you can be
what the hell is that supposed to mean
you mightve risked klaangs life in a foolish attempt to swing back and rescue the captain
i cant believe this
the situation must be analysed logically
i dont remember the captain analyzing anything when he went back for you on that roof
that is a specious analogy
is it
youre wasting your time klaang knows nothing it would be unwise to discharge that weapon in this room
what is this room what goes on in here
youre very curious jon may i call you jon
am i supposed to be impressed that you know my name
ive learned a great deal about you even more than you know
well i guess you have me at a disadvantage so why dont you drop this invisible man routine and let me see who im talking to
hull platings been repolarised
stand by impulse engines mister tucker status
the autosequencers online but annular confinements still off by two microns
that should suffice
easy for you to say
if the suliban have reestablished their defences well have no other option
you wouldnt have come looking for klaang if sarin had told you what she knew that means youre no threat to me jon but i do need you to leave this room  now
this chameleon thing is pretty fancy was it payment for pitting the klingons against each other or a trophy from your temporal cold war
i was going to let you go
really then you obviously dont know as much about me as you thought you did
on the contrary i couldve told you what day you were going to die but i suppose thats about to change
whats the matter no genetic tricks to keep you from getting knocked on your butt
what you call tricks we call progress are you aware that your genome is almost identical to that of an ape the suliban dont share humanitys patience with natural selection
so to speed things up a little you struck a deal with the devil
we have four more coming up off starboard
can we dock ensign
these arent ideal conditions
mister tucker were going to plan b
now
bridge weve got him sorry captain we had no other choice
maljagor
womigh oagh qala
something about disgracing the empire he says hes ready to die
pog
chugdah hegh volcha va
ill take that as a thank you
i dont think they have a word for thank you
what did he say
you dont want to know
come in ive just gotten a response to the message i sent to admiral forrest he enjoyed telling the vulcan high command about the suliban we ran into it isnt every day he gets to be the one dispensing information i wanted you both to hear starfleets orders before i inform the crew
orders
your people are sending a transport to pick you up
i was under the impression that enterprise would be taking me back to earth
it would be a little out of our way admiral forrest sees no reason why we shouldnt keep going
son of a bitch
i have a feeling doctor phlox wont mind staying around for a while hes developing a fondness for the human endocrine system
ill get double shifts on the repair work
i think that outer hulls going to need a little patching up lets hope thats the last time somebody takes a shot at us
lets hope
tpol would you stick around for a minute ever since i can remember ive seen vulcans as an obstacle always keeping us from standing on our own two feet
i understand
no i dont think you do if im going to pull this off there are a few things i have to leave behind things like preconceptions holding grudges this mission wouldve failed without your help
i wont dispute that
i was thinking a vulcan science officer could come in handy but if i asked you to stay it might look like i wasnt ready to do this on my own
perhaps you should add pride to your list
perhaps i should
it might be best if i were to contact my superiors and make the request myself with your permission
permission granted
i hope nobody is in a big hurry to get home starfleet seems to think that were ready to begin our mission i understand theres an inhabited planet a few light years from here
weve detected it sir sensors show a nitrogen sulfide atmosphere
probably not humanoids
thats what were here to find out prepare to break orbit and lay in a course
im reading an ion storm on that trajectory sir should i go around it
we cant be afraid of the wind ensign take us to warp four
i didnt realise you spoke slug
wish i did she doesnt look any better does she
she we havent been able to determine its gender yet if it has one
i should have left her where i found her
nonsense youre on a mission of exploration theres something to be learned from every lifeform
she wasnt meant to be in this environment
i promise to do my best to keep it alive
hes going to make you all better
actually i was thinking more about my pyrithian bat he wont eat anything once its dead
weve routed some more power to sickbay let me know if its enough
this should do fine
hows sluggo
doctor phlox thinks this argon lamp should help shes barely moved all day
weve been out here for two weeks and the only first contact weve made is with a dying worm
come in
scans of the sectors ahead
shush hear that
hear what
a squeak somethings squeaking i think its coming from under the deck plating but every time i get close to it it stops if i cant isolate it im going to have to tear the whole flooring up
that would be unfortunate the scans of the sectors ahead indicate little chance of finding inhabited planets
how about the vulcan star charts
we have limited data on the course starfleet has assigned you
there are thousands of star systems along this path there must have been something that piqued your peoples interest a sentient species a trinary star cluster
we dont select our destinations by what piques our interest
vulcans always need a logical and pragmatic reason
my people dont share your enthusiasm for exploration  space is vast captain
im sure youre aware that only one out of every forty three thousand planets supports intelligent life
i took exobiology i know the statistics but were travelling at warp five theres got to be someone out here come in
im sorry
ill leave you to your exploring
trip tells me that sluggos not faring too well
no sir but the doctors doing the best he can sir my quarters are on e deck starboard section five
yes
the stars are going the wrong way sir
wrong way
on both my training tours i had port side quarters im having trouble sleeping
because youre on the
the wrong side of the ship yes sir i spoke with ensign porter he said hes be willing to switch with your permission
you got it cant have my comm officer falling asleep on the bridge
i appreciate it captain
is there something else hoshi
no sir thank you
ready
fore and aft target scanners are aligned
activating simulation j6 target acquired
simulated launch
five seconds to impact three two one
wonderful
were only off by three metres
only three metres three metres could mean the difference between hitting a weapons port and a warp core instead of disabling a vessel wed end up destroying it and probably ourselves in the process
well get it right
all this should have been dealt with before we left earth have they detected any inhabited planets or vessels
not yet
good
i hope you dont expect everyone we run into out here to be hostile in twenty three years i dont think my folks ran into a problem more than a half dozen times
i dont believe you were ever out quite this far
do you think that makes a difference
all i do know is until we get these targeting scanners working properly the further we are from everyone else the better
seems like everybody else on board is itching for a first contact
hows it going
not well sir weve corrected the problem but were still off by point oh two percent its unacceptable
are you sure its not the simulations that are off
theres only one way to find out
how long would it take to arm a few torpedoes
moments sir
archer to tpol
yes sir
prepare to drop out of warp its time for a little target practice
acknowledged
thank you captain
come on travis weve got to find mister reed something to blow up
try to locate an asteroid field a comet just do it quickly i want to get back to warp
yes sir we made a trip once from livinius to belarn prime two and a half light years nearly nine months without running into a soul there were five kids on board we were at each others throats within a matter of weeks first officer and my mother came up with the idea to teach us how to play geography you know you say amazon river which ends in an r i say rhode island
which ends in a d dralax
x x
now theres always
dont tell me i know an x xanadu
thats not a real place
doesnt matter
of course it matters
well you used an alien planet dralax
i thought you said this game kept you from arguing
load another one lets try again
rotate the targeting axis by point five microns
point five microns
mister reed
if i refocus the infrared scanner i might be able to compensate
how long will that take
the better part of a day
resume course ensign
sir
were not going to sit on our butt for twenty four hours make your modifications well run another test first chance we get
anyone sitting here
no please sit down sit down
sluggo any better
im afraid not try the potatoes theyre delicious
resequenced protein
yes the flavours remarkable on my homeworld people would never think of speaking during a meal considered a waste of time its taken me a while but ive grown quite attached to it
wasting time seems to be all weve been doing starting to get a little antsy
antsy
restless weve been on the move for two weeks and havent seen a damn thing
every moments been an adventure for me humans are so unpredictable have you seen the quantities of food crewman namod consumes
not really
have you smelled ensign socorro after she exercises she gives off a fragrance not unlike the adrenal gland of a nausicaan and crewmen bennett and haynem over there do you see them
if im not mistaken they are preparing to mate do you think they might let me watch
its good to see youre enjoying yourself
bridge to captain archer
how big is it
approximately ninety two metres in length
doesnt seem to be moving very fast
its not moving at all
thats odd wheres the nearest star system
almost three light years away
they could be running some kind of a deep space experiment maybe we should go have a look
if you insist on allowing your curiosity to dictate your actions
we insist
range five thousand kilometres
the vessels hull is comprised of tritanium and disilicon polymers
im not getting anything on their propulsion system but it may be offline something isnt it
if they have weapons theyre not charged
any comm activity
no sir
run this through the translation matrix my name is jonathan archer im captain of the starship enterprise were on a mission of peaceful exploration oh we come from the planet earth were sending you a pulsar grid that should help you locate our star system did you rotate the frequencies
ill try it again no response sir
captain mind if i push in on the venting ports around that hatch
go ahead
are those venting ports or hull breaches
bring us in a little closer travis lets get a look at the other side those look like scorch marks
the residue indicates oxidation and thermal shock effects it could be the result of a high yield particle impact
you mean weapons
possibly
are we close enough to scan for biosigns
yes but scanning their ships interior might be seen as a violation of privacy
anything
if there is anyone home you can bet they know were out here
then why havent they responded
not everyone chooses to answer the door when they hear a knock it would be best to resume our previous course
see if you can find another hatch diameter
point nine metres
scan for biosigns
there are a number of lifeforms aboard
humanoid
their cellular activity is below the threshold of your sensors
maybe theyre in trouble sick or something
maybe theyre not interested in visitors
mister reed how long to prep a shuttle
half an hour
there are a number of protocols we havent tried
get started
she may have a point captain i could try hailing them on thetaband frequencies
suit up ensign
me sir
the ship is yours
is there a problem commander
i want to go with you
im bringing a translator and a security officer why would i need an engineer
what makes you think you can open the hatch or turn the light on for that matter
weve got beacons trip
that ship could have a lot of decks you might need someone to help you figure out the turbolifts okay ive got a better reason why you need an engineer because your engineer signed onto this mission of exploration so he could do a little exploring he didnt sign on to sit in engineering while you three get to break into that ship
were not breaking in were just going to see if everythings okay
youre chomping at the bit to find out whats in there why should i be any different
we just got out here trip theres going to be plenty of time to go exploring right now i need you on enterprise down with your engine this ships a little young to be without her chief engineer
when i used to dream about this mission the last thing i envisioned was having a vulcan on board who continuously sucked the air out of the room well shes right whoevers on that ship might no want us nosing around but i cant assume thats the case can i maybe they could use our help computer pause  hey you know that you and cheddar dont get along  resume personal log before we left admiral forrest said wed be making history with every light year but were not going to do that sitting on our hands computer pause come in ensign
sorry to bother you sir
its not a problem cheese
no thank you
everything work out all right
sir
with the swapping quarters
yes thats fine thank you i was thinking captain i might be a lot more helpful to you if i stay here and keep an open comm link that way ill have immediate access to the linguistic database
cant you tie your universal translator into the database through the comm
its not the same the lag time is tripled
well id rather wait a few seconds if it means having you on site for all we know the ut wont work youll be our only backup anyway it should be exciting half the crew would give their eye teeth to be going over there whats wrong
the environmental suits they make me a little claustrophobic
claustrophobic and you took a job on a spaceship
you talked me into it remember
i dont recall reading about any problems during your zerog training
well i just i bit my lip and got through it
well youre just going to have to bite your lip again i need you over there
yes sir
what is it hoshi is something else wrong
no id better get back to the launch bay
hang on ill come with you thats the last time porthos
going to war lieutenant
cant be too careful sir
youve seen too many science fiction movies we just need the three phase pistols put the rifles back  what are you rated for
ive been cleared on em sidearms and class three pulse rifles ive never seen one of those
malcolm will check you out on it first chance he gets dont worry it handles pretty much like an em33
is this necessary
just a precaution
just our luck no release shouldnt be a problem though i can place microcharges here and here
hold on a second malcolm
sorry
enterprise weve got access were boarding the vessel
well at least we know theyre bipeds
what gives you that idea
the ladder
come on nitrogenmethane atmosphere and its cold minus twenty degrees
theres power going through here but not much of it
captain
molecules look like amino acids
blood
these icons look like they represent frequency bands
communications
if it is its offline maybe thats why they didnt answer our hails
they may have been in no condition to answer our hails
guys does any of this make sense to you anything
could these be power couplings
and these could be transfer conduits could be a schematic to their power layout
yeah one diagram for each deck
and whats this
thats midship one deck below if were right something down there is drawing a lot of power
lets go see if were right
some sort of hydraulics
whatever it is it hasnt been here very long
hoshi where are you going
i dont think you need a translator
stay here
their bodies are being flushed out with some kind of fluid
are they all
all dead sir im afraid so
theyre clean
how many
i dont know about a dozen
fifteen
theyre being drained of something whoever did it went to a lot of trouble my guess is theyre coming back
we should leave
there are fifteen dead people over there we cant leave
your reason for boarding that vessel was to provide assistance if assistance was required clearly it no longer is
youre telling me that we should just leave them there
whats the alternative your intentions were admirable captain but nothing can be done for that crew now and if we remain here your crew could be put in jeopardy
archer to the bridge
mayweather here sir
go to warp three resume course
aye sir
not long after i became a physician there was an explosion on a cargo ship orbiting my homeworld i was part of the first medical team to arrive there were seventeen bodies on the bridge alone id never seen that many dead people in one place before very disturbing you have nothing to be ashamed of
i screamed like a twelve year old
were all frightened by unfamiliar things you should be grateful that your body of experience doesnt include rooms full of corpses
nobody else screamed  has she been eating
not so far she has been under a great deal of stress but im hoping this protein concentrate whets her appetite
im a translator i didnt come out here to see corpses hanging on hooks
it goes without saying that youre going to encounter the unexpected
not corpses on hooks
have you ever considered that you might be happier back at the university teaching i did it for years it was quite rewarding
im an exolinguist i graduated second in my class i spent three years in starfleet training i was jonathan archers first choice for this mission every inhabited world we come to is going to be filled with language some will have hundreds of them he needs me here
if she doesnt take these nutrients im afraid she wont survive
are you sure thats what she eats
its close enough
i shouldnt have brought her on board maybe i could ask the captain to try to find a planet with an argon rich atmosphere
it might be easier just to feed her to my bat
she needs to get back to an environment that is more suited to her
perhaps some place where she could teach
what kind of pasta is this its great
chef told me i dont remember
not too spicy for you
its fine
malcolms anxious to run another weapons test especially after what happened tea
no thank you
captain
sure thanks
i heard they were humanoid is that right
humanoid
did they look anything like us
they were in uniform
but you didnt recognise the species
they were crewmen murdered on their own ship fifteen dead crewmen
i detected a stellar nursery along our present course
i saw one once through the big lens outside anchorage
a closer view might alleviate some of the crews tension
whats the matter the tension bothering you
not in the least
must be great not to let things bother you no remorse no guilt what if they were vulcans think you would have reacted the same way
they werent vulcans
i said what if they were vulcans would you have just left them there hanging like slaughtered animals dont you think maybe you would have taken them down tried to figure out who they were made some effort to contact their families
we dont know where they came from it would be very difficult to locate their families
we didnt even try  what about you what if they were humans would you just stick your tail between your legs and run leave them there to rot am i the only one whos having a problem with this
you said it yourself sir whoever killed those people are probably coming back
so we should avoid confrontation cost is that what youre saying is that what you vulcans do bury your heads in the sand and then just fly on by
we vulcans would have never gone on board that ship in the first place
you got an answer for everything dont you
we have a code of behaviour and we try to obey it
you may not believe this but humans have a code of behaviour too it took a few thousand years but i think were starting to get it right i cant believe i almost ignored it
weve reversed course sir we should be back at the coordinates in five hours
you dont have a problem with the environmental suit
not at all
good were going to need you to examine the bodies try to identify their species while youre at it it wouldnt hurt if you can figure out whats being done to them
ill see what i can do captain
you wanted to see whats going on over there nows your chance i cant think of a better way to find their people than through their own comm system youre going to need to get it up and running
aye sir
hoshi will decipher their language and compose a message hopefully itll make sense
captain
im sorry ensign
ill bring a security detail
theres no one over there who can hurt us stay here and work on those targeting scanners prepare to suit up at fourteen hundred hours dismissed
how were they killed
different ways this one was given a lethal dose of chloraxine the first three back there were shot particle weapons i believe this fellow hasnt suffered as much cellular decay hes our best candidate for a postmortem care to assist
yeah
maybe its a log what do you think
beats me could be a laundry list or instructions on how to conquer the universe
the grammar sounds bimodal
their transceivers intact lets hope the next time we make first contact it isnt with a room full of corpses
lets hope  ship ship
just what i thought
what
a zymuth gland it releases triglobulin into the blood thats what all these tubes and pumps are about whoever did this is trying to collect triglobulin
what for
oh for any number of reasons to create medicines vaccines some species have even been known to use it as an aphrodisiac
aphrodisiac
its quite a common practice im surprised youre not familiar with it
humans used to collect the bile of black bears grind down rhino horns things like that but not people
its worth noting that triglobulin is very similar to human lymphatic fluid
how long before the transceivers online
a minute or two i cant get enough of this an alien spaceship sending off a message to who knows where
the quicker we get this done the quicker we can get back to the ship
its your second away mission in two days
yeah great
i wish i had an ear for languages the captains going to need a translator with him a lot more often than an engineer
distress two other teachers and i once took a hydroskimmer out onto a small tributary in the amazon you know to see the wildlife sloths pink dolphins all kinds of snakes
wow
it gave me the creeps if i didnt like being around anacondas you can imagine how i feel about suliban or whoever butchered the crew of this ship im going to ask the captain to take me home
you serious
i should have never left the university im not suited for this
give it a try youll be fine
you werent here yesterday i saw those bodies and fell apart the captain needs a translator he can count on someone who shows a little grace under pressure that isnt me
you cant be sure of that
oh yes i can distress distress
kunatsila
i think ive got it ship in distress
dukdum dor kunatsila
tpol to archer
go ahead
theres a vessel approaching captain its power signatures match the scans you took of those biopumps
it appears that whoever killed that crew has returned
time to go doc
trip hoshi docking hatch now
distance sixty thousand kilometres
bridge to armoury
armoury
we have a potentially hostile vessel approaching are you prepared to defend the ship
that depends how long till it gets here
ten minutes maybe less
then the answer is most likely no the scanners are still out of alignment look if you wanted me to hit a stationary dairy barn then i could accommodate you but not a moving
vessel
do the best you can but i need you on the bridge in five minutes
archer to tpol deploy the docking arm
arm extended
how close are they
eight thousand kilometres
what kind of weapons
our sensors cant penetrate their shielding
have you tried hailing them
yes
theres been no response
try again
the pods on the arm
tpol to archer theyre still not responding
theyre charging weapons
theyre targeting our engines
were almost in stand by to jump to warp
doors
archer to the bridge it doesnt feel like weve gone to warp
our port nacelle has been damaged
have malcolm arm the torpedoes
report
were dead in the water sir
they seem to have stopped firing theyre closing on our position
malcolm
both forward tubes loaded and ready sir
stand by starboard tube
yes sir
fire
stand by port tube
ready
fire
trip warp status
the nacelles been completely depolarised im afraid were stuck here for a while
what was that
a submolecular bioscan youve been probed ensign weve all been probed they have no doubt discovered that your lymphatic systems contain some useful compounds
get to the armoury start distributing hand weapons  post security teams at level
sir another vessel just dropped out of warp
theyre on an intercept course
lets see it
theyre hailing us
put it up
captain
hes from the same species as the murdered crew  they must have picked up your distress call tell him the ship above us killed the crew of the cargo vessel theyre about to do the same to us
i told him what you said sir but i doubt it made any sense
what do you mean
this isnt exactly spanish were dealing with here id be lucky if im getting half the vocabulary right
theyve locked onto us with some kind of stabilising beam
use the impulse engines get us the hell out of here
i cant sir their beams disrupting all our propulsion systems
it seems he got the part about killing the cargo ship crew but he believes we did it sir at least i think he does
tell him we sent the distress call why would we kill his people and then do that
i think i understood this one he says the distress call came from his ship not ours
we needed their frequencies going there was the only way to find them
something about dna scans he wants to know why we were there two years ago
two years ago
he probably means two days sir the phonetic processors still having trouble locking on im not certain but i dont think hes going to help us
theyre fifty metres above us forty nine
the pumps tell them to run scans on the biopumps that are hooked up to the corpses theyll see theyre not our technology have them compare the power signatures to the ship thats about to land on our roof where are they malcolm
theyve stopped at about ten metres
im having trouble with the word pump sir ive got the processor searching for synonyms the translators not making a whole lot of sense to him sir hes getting frustrated i think hes running out of patience captain
then forget the translator do it yourself
do what myself
talk to him
thats impossible sir i havent even learned their basic conjugations
talk to him hoshi it doesnt have to be perfect
you dont understand i dont even know how to say pump ill get it all wrong itll just make things worse
things cant get much worse
sir
captain theyve started drilling into the hull
hoshi hoshi i need you to do this we all do thats why youre here
uta doi ura
again
uta lora ista urasta mistavor
whatd he say ensign
theyre targeting the vessel above us
weve got impulse back
move us away
captain i may be wrong but i think ive got the scanners aligned permission to launch a torpedo
granted
nice of them to wait until we got clear all stop  i think we may have just made a friend thanks to you
this isnt exactly like the place you came from but its close enough its not that hard to adapt youre going to do just fine here
how can you eat that stuff
its healthier than that
at least this tastes like something
i guess it just takes a more discriminating palate to appreciate vulcan cuisine do you know there are over five thousand subspecies of termites on loracus prime
i thought we were headed for a nebula
anybody hear about this
not a word
i wonder if somebody lives there
theres a lot of plant life it might be an oxygen atmosphere
what do you think first contact
i dont see any cities or agriculture
maybe they live underground or in the water
is that snow on those mountains
youd think the captain would make an announcement or something
well call him
tpol
seventeen percent oxygen eighty one percent nitrogen
sounds like home
any people
the planet supports a diverse ecology but there are no signs of humanoid life
still someone may have a claim on it we dont want to go waltzing into their back yard scan for marker buoys beacons manmade satellites
none in range sir looks like no ones planted a flag just yet
prep a shuttlepod mister tucker  i like the looks of the northern continent see if you can find a good place to set down
yes sir
captain there are a number of protocols you may want to consider
protocols
vulcan ships would begin by sending automated probes down to collect more detailed scans if the planet proved to be minsharaclass we would then conduct a geophysical survey from orbit
minsharaclass
suitable for humanoid life
how long would all that take
six or seven days
you expect us to sit up here for a week while probes have all the fun
this planet has been here a long time it will still be here in seven days
i understand that you have a more cautious approach but we didnt come out here to tiptoe around  get the pod ready
id like you to put together the survey team i assume thats not a violation of protocol
thanks
i tried some plomeek broth this morning it was very good vulcan food is interesting
did you sterilise the sample containers
yes thanks for choosing me for this mission
you were selected because your specialty is entomology this planet has a diverse insect population
great
youd have better luck making friends with a housefly
i know
wow
worth every light year
set us down just east of those hills
aye sir
where no dog has gone before
i almost forgot what fresh air smells like
the atmosphere contains trace elements of nitrogen dioxide chloromethane
put that thing away take a minute to enjoy yourself the sky ever get this blue on vulcan
occasionally
were walking on an alien world light years from earth or vulcan doesnt that impress you
ive been to thirty six minshara class planets this experience is only marginally different
perfect hold it right there
smile be sure to get a copy of that to the vulcan high command
you have your assignments well rendezvous here at nineteen hundred hours unless the captain wants us to pose for more pictures
im afraid my log entry isnt going to do this justice
a cabin in these woods would be nice
three weeks in deep space youre ready to jump ship
dont worry im not going anywhere you guys would be lost without me
its beautiful all right but i couldnt call a place home unless it came with a pair of warp nacelles
boomers
archer
is there a problem captain
no no problem
why
we were scheduled to rendezvous fifteen minutes ago
sorry we lost track of time well be right there
weve identified several nocturnal marsupials id like to keep crewmen cutler and novakovich with me overnight to study them
im glad to see youre getting into the spirit of things pick you up in the morning
captain if its all right with you travis and id like to stay as well
we would
when was the last time you slept under the stars theres plenty of camping gear in the pod
this isnt shore leave this is a research mission
why cant it be a little bit of both research isnt the only reason were out here pitch your tent commander
thanks captain  dont worry well keep out of your hair
keep in mind those cargo vessels werent equipped for rescue operations so the captain wasnt sure what to do when he picked up the distress call but it wasnt a ship that sent the signal it was a lifepod from one of the old y500class freighters
those were retired decades ago
exactly the pod had been drifting in space for sixty three years bioscans showed one lifesign inside the pod human the assistant engineer george webb a friend of my uncles was assigned to open it took him over an hour to cut through the hull he said the metal felt strange cold to the touch
of course it was cold it was floating in space for sixty years
he could hear a tapping noise coming from inside but when he finally got it open the pod was empty no body nothing a few days later webb started acting strange getting into fights with the crew muttering to himself in some sort of alien language then one day he locked himself in engineering and overloaded the impulse reactors he almost destroyed the ship then he sealed himself in a life pod and ejected it
i assume the captain went after him
the reactors were too badly damaged some people say it was an alien life form that got into him others think it was the ghost of a dead crewman i never knew what to believe but webb is still out there drifting when the subspace noise is real low some comm officers say they can still hear the echo of his distress call beep beep
its highly doubtful that a distress beacon could function continuously for sixty three years
let me guess no ghost stories on vulcan
thats it to the left of that trinary cluster
what
our sun
are you sure
yeah positive just another speck of light no different than any other
when i was a kid id go camping with my buddies wed spend half the night looking up at the stars wondering what our own sun would look like from this far away
now you know
are you okay
headache if its all right with you id like to lie down for a while before we get back to work
certainly
has anyone heard the one about the haunted comet
wait a minute you notice something fireflies are gone
nice going travis you scared off the bugs
maybe its the ghost of george webb
looks like we might have ourselves a little weather
a front is approaching from the south west
it must be gusting at eighty kph
this is nothing compared to a hurricane coming up through the florida keys
try flying through an ion storm at warp two
did you hear that
what
someones out there
its the wind
ow son of a bitch
what is it
theres something in my bag
give me your boot
what for
so i can squash it
are we allowed to squash alien life forms
if theyre inside your sleeping bag
there it is wait a minute whered you put the phase pistols
you wanna shoot a bug
im just going to stun it
tpol to tucker
go ahead
is there a problem commander
oh no just an eight inch scorpion thing inside our tent
do you require assistance
i think ive got it under control
no not there its over there
tpol you said you found a cave this afternoon
less than half a kilometre from here
i think were going to need it
come in
nice catch youd make a good two metre man too bad we dont have a pool on board
a shame a wind storms moving across the northern continent it looks like a nasty one
survey team
theyve taken shelter but id recommend pulling them out ive got a shuttlepod on standby
archer to tpol
yes captain
whats your status
weve relocated into a cavern
mister reed thinks we should come down and get you
a landing under these circumstances might be difficult well be protected until the winds diminish
well keep an eye on the storm let us know if you need anything
understood
keep the pod on standby just in case
aye sir
whos got the food packs
nope
travis
not me sir
we must have left them at the campsite
ill go
be careful
trip hello
was anybody outside just now
just you why
theres someone else out there
what
near the campsite
i think weve had enough ghost stories for one night
its no story
weve scanned the planet its uninhabited
im telling you i saw three people
three what did they look like
it was too dark
subcommander
other than ourselves there are no humanoid life forms here
there could be something wrong with your scanner
its functioning perfectly perhaps you imagined seeing them
they looked pretty real to me
ethan
theres someone back there i heard voices are you going to tell me im imagining things too its not safe here
we dont know that they could be friendly
then why are they hiding why dont they come out and say hello we should leave
where do you propose we go back out into the storm
its better than being trapped in here
slow down crewman thats an order
ethan
stay here
travis
ill be back shortly
where are you going
if theres someone back there i intend to find them
ethan
travis i saw one
it came right out of that rock like it was a part of it
that could explain why theyre not showing up on our scanners
its too dangerous we should go back
who were they
excuse me
well who were you talking to
talking to theres no one here
weve lost novakovich and were apparently not alone theres some kind of lifeform down here
can you make it back to the cavern
were heading there now sir
the captains on his way were getting out of here
not a moment too soon from what i saw these things live inside the rock
i performed a geological analysis the rocks are composed of limestone and cormalite nothing more
shes lying commander i saw her talking to them
crewman
in there there were two of them
shes mistaken
no im not why wont you tell us whats going on what do they want
ive got a fix twenty kilometres northeast
archer to novakovich ethan respond
whos there who is that
this is captain archer were attempting to land i want you to get back to the cavern
go to hell
i have no reason to deceive you
neither does she you keep claiming these creatures dont exist but the rest of us have all seen them thats a little strange dont you think
i cant explain what youve seen but i assure you i didnt speak to anyone
id like to believe you but you vulcans dont exactly have a spotless track record when it comes to being honest with us
your point
youve held things back before you might be doing it again  tucker here
were closing in on your position trip theres a clearing a hundred metres from the cave entrance get to it
im reading them two kilometres due west
im taking us down theres a lot of wind shear near the surface activate the auxiliary landing thrusters altitude seventy metres forty metres
ill have to try a different vector
starboard
i see it
thruster fours down were leaking plasma coolant
almost there
sir we cant safely land in this wind with a thruster out
archer to tucker
captain arent you forgetting something
were going to have to wait
until the wind dies down try to manage till then
well do our best sir
if you run across
any more of these aliens try to make contact
see what you can find out about them
understood
you okay
never better
you heard the captain he wants to know about your friends what are you going to tell him what are you going to tell him
this is pointless
is it were stuck down here for god knows how long with a bunch of rock people who for all we know are staring at us from these walls right now not to mention a crewman out there who probably wont last the night now if were going to get through this i need to know what the hells going on you beginning to see my point
i share your concern for crewman novakovich but as i told you
you couldnt care less about him or any of the rest of us that would require some of those useless human emotions
your emotions are beginning to affect your judgment youre becoming irrational
youve never seen me irrational
sir i hate to add to our problems but were running low on water
great well have to conserve whats left
that wont be necessary
i detected water about sixty metres in that direction
how do we know youre not going in there to talk to your friends
join me if youd like
it could be a trap commander
i can survive without water for several days can you
sit down
you heard me
hows he doing
not good his biosigns are very erratic
try him again
enterprise to novakovich
can you hear me ethan
mister reed can you get a lock on him
yes sir
looks like our only choice
understood stand by
theres a problem sir there are contaminants in the matter stream the phase discriminator cant seem to isolate the debris
reed to sickbay medical emergency
what are you doing
working
on what
scans i took this afternoon
find anything you want to tell me about
theres nothing of scientific interest on this planet our mission here was a waste of time
thats what youd like us to think let me see that thing
the readings are in vulcan you wont understand them
no but hoshi would this could be evidence
of what
your little conspiracy
i was wrong there is something of interest here ive learned a great deal about human behaviour
oh
under stress you become volatile youre a far more dangerous species than i previously believed
your people have been telling us that kind of crap for a hundred years looks like you finally found a way to put us back in our cage
sir
imagine the news back home travis enterprise crew found dead six weeks into their historic voyage the bodies of all eighty two crewmembers were located on an uninhabited world a vulcan ship made the unfortunate discovery cause of death remains a mystery but what the vulcans wont say is they know exactly who attacked us in fact they arranged the whole thing they lured us down here so they could sabotage our mission
you were the one who found these caves and it was your idea to stay overnight
i didnt ask you or mister tucker to join us
we know youre here why dont you show yourselves youre not afraid of us are you
theres no one there commander
maybe youre waiting for the others to come down so you can kill us all at once did you see that
all i see is a delusional engineer
sounds like youre getting a little volatile yourself subcommander i thought you had your emotions all locked up having a little problem are you
commander there
you think im going to wait around here for you to slaughter us ill blow this whole cave apart if i have to i know you hear me
human skin is a resilient organ these wounds should heal nicely
can i talk to him
yes but i doubt hell make much sense have you ever heard of tropolisine
no
its a psychotropic compound known for its hallucinogenic effects this crewmans bloodstream is filled with it
if it was down on the planet why didnt our sensors pick it up
normally its found in certain flowering plants perhaps your sensors werent calibrated to detect it
or perhaps it wasnt there until that damn wind started
how long will the effects last
now that hes back on enterprise he should be alright in three or four hours
will this tro
tropolisine
will it affect tpol as well
theres no way to know it might affect her to a lesser degree or a greater degree
archer to tpol
yes captain
we have novakovich
and i have a phase pistol pointed at my head
what
my suspicions were
right on the nose captain our little vulcan here is
not what she appears to be never was
what are you talking about
theres some kind of
creatures down here they hide inside solid rock travis and i have both seen them cutler saw two of them talking to tpol theyre up to something but of course she denies it
listen to me youve all been exposed to a psychotropic compound it causes heightened anxiety
hallucinations
are you telling me those creatures arent real
the compound comes from the pollen of a flower we think it was blown down from the mountains when the wind started the doctors run tests on novakovich he thinks hes going to be okay in a few hours so if you can get
as deep as you can into the caves your symptoms should dissipate around the same times
we didnt imagine this captain
you dealt with simulations very close to this in starfleet training youre familiar with mindaltering agents well be down to get you as soon as the winds let up
youre not down here captain
you dont understand whats going on
put your weapon down trip thats an order
tpol
hes lowered his phase pistol sir
have you been affected
yes but only slightly
try to hold on archer out
get to the bridge i want a weather report
travis  you still with me i need you on your feet those things could come back at any time listen to me im giving you an order
whats wrong ensign  whatd you do to him i can see why you get along so well with them sneaking around in the shadows thats second nature to you vulcans isnt it
i have no idea what you just said but it didnt sound very nice youre making a mistake working with her shell stab you in the back first chance she gets tell you what come out and well settle this peacefully whatever she told you about humans its not true you can see for yourself say something
what are you doing her yes sir
i know i know but theyre not giving me much choice ive got to protect my crew i understand mister velik but i cant do that
theyre trying to kill us
nice try
the centre of the storms already passed over them but the system spans some five hundred kilometres we wont be able to land a shuttlepod before dawn
whens that
nine hours
phlox to captain archer
go ahead
please report to sickbay immediately its urgent
i thought you said he was going to be fine
i did but each tropolisine atom contains a stray neutron when it started to break down in his bloodstream it released an undetectable toxin ive injected him with inoprovalene but i think it may be too late if id run a submolecular scan i might have anticipated the complication but there was no reason to at least there didnt seem to be i cant tell you how sorry i am captain
what about the others
they spent less time exposed
ive got four people down on the surface doctor i need to know if theyre going to be dead when we get there in the morning
stay awake travis i cant afford to have you going out on me
im trying sir
cutler you okay  if youre waiting for me to pass out youre wasting your time you might as well have your friends come out now do whatever theyre going to do
tpol
how are you doing
whos that
its the captain trip are you all right
hes irrational sir mayweather and cutler are nearly unconscious
both of you listen to me very carefully novakovich may be dying
turns out the pollen contains some kind of toxin our sensors hadnt detected hes responding to medication but his odds of recovery would be a hell of a lot better if wed treated him sooner the doctor and malcolm are synthesizing ampoules of inoprovalene were going to have to use the transporter to get it to you but its imperative that you inoculate yourselves as soon as possible do you understand what im saying
taking an injection isnt going to change a damn thing dont you see that theyre planning something captain first us then all of you
whats going on hoshi
she says trips going to kill her and i dont think shes imagining it
say one more word of that gibberish and im going to split you in two
trip listen to me
the pollens affecting her too think about it youve heard of people suffering from dementia who revert to their native language
she cant help it
the only thing thats affecting her are those rock people if i can stop her now i can save enterprise
trip how long have we known each other
whats that got to do with anything
remember when your ev pack froze up on titan during the omega training mission you got nitrogen narcosis you started to try to take off your helmet you remember what im talking about
whats your point
i ordered you to keep your helmet on
you were delirious thought you were going to die but you obeyed that order because you trusted me
im asking you to trust me now
take the injection then well deal with these rock people
too late captain im not going to die with a hypospray in my hand
trip
no its not going to happen
all right
forget the medicine i think its time i explain whats really going on but just stand by for a minute i need malcolm to target your position
then ill give you your orders
archer to phlox the sooner
the better
understood
how close can you get it
i think i can safely place it two metres inside the mouth of the cave
good
captain hello im waiting for that order
but i cant wait much longer
all right trip this is a major breach of security but im going to have to trust you
go ahead
starfleet sent us here to make contact with a siliconbased life form tpol was the only person granted clearance
to speak with them seems theyve met vulcans before
why couldnt you tell me that
when a missions classified top secret i dont ask why
if it was so top secret then whyd you let us all come down to the surface let us spend the night
the winds
we never thought the storm would drive you into the caves thats where these rock people live they didnt want anybody in there except for tpol so theyre not too happy right now im sure you can understand that
theyve even threatened to destroy enterprise now tpol needs to explain to them why youre all there but shes not going to have much credibility with you pointing a phase pistol at her
if they agree to listen to her youll need to lower your weapon if they dont im going to have malcolm destroy the cavern sacrificing four more crewmen is a small price to pay to save enterprise
i understand
now im going to ask hoshi to tell tpol everything i just told you in vulcan
you got a problem with that
go ahead
ensign
she says playacting isnt exactly a vulcan tradition but shell do her best
hope she knows the difference between stun and kill
theyve agreed to talk to her trip so lower your weapon
and act real friendly
no
you didnt shoot me last night did you
im afraid i did
i was hoping it was all just a bad dream
are they gone
they were never here
what
there were no rock people you were all hallucinating
the pollen
yes
then what about that speech you gave to the wall
the captain felt that if i played along it might help to persuade you to lower your weapon youd grown increasingly illogical and violent something about splitting me in two
a pretty good performance look i know i kind of shot my mouth off last night
you were under the influence of the pollen we all were
challenge you preconceptions or theyll challenge you
commander
thats something mister velik used to say tenth grade biology class he was a vulcan scientist who came to teach us about life on other worlds id never seen a vulcan before not up close he scared the hell out of me
perhaps its not too late to follow his advice
ow i must have twisted up my neck hows novakovich do we know
the captain says hes going to be fine
archer to the bridge
lieutenant reed sir
what the hells going on
we are having a little trouble with the gravity plating on e deck i hope it hasnt caused you
any inconvenience
oh no no no not at all any idea when you might get it back online
commander tucker says it should be any minute now sir
thank you
not a very adventurous breakfast
plomeek broth is a traditional morning meal on vulcan
ah but youre not on vulcan you should try these blueberry pancakes theyre quite delicious
i sampled human food on several occasions it didnt agree with me
give it some time the vulcan digestive tract is highly adaptable
i prefer to eat the foods im accustomed to
theres an old saying when in fellebis do as the fellebians do
its difficult enough having to smell all this eating it is out of the question
water carbonated
now thats adventurous
were getting reports from c deck that its down to twelve degrees ensign almack is working on it
well tell him to hurry up if the relays up there get too cold theyre going to start cutting out on us  engineering
weve got a power fluctuation in the starboard nacelle sir
well get to it as soon as we can
aye sir
any luck
we know its got something to do with the plasma exhaust the flows been restricted for some reason and its screwing up half the systems on the ship  tell billy to purge the aft manifold
sir
you think it might be a good idea to drop out of warp
give me a minute sir i think we can figure it out
tucker to bridge might be a good idea to drop out of warp
going to impulse sir
commander i think ive found the problem
somethings distorting our wake pattern
youre right the plasma exhaust shouldnt be flaring that close to the ship
em residue in the exhaust ports
no we checked theyre clean
malcolm if we ignited the plasma exhaust what kind of damage would it do to the nacelles
sir
how much damage
if we polarize the hull plating it should be all right as long as we maintained at least half impulse
go to half impulse ensign
aye sir
put up a4
record all aft sensors
hull plating
both nacelles are at maximum
stand by to ignite a charge at eighty metres due aft
fire play it back slowly go back and freeze it at the flashpoint creep it forward a little there
looks like weve got ourselves a hitchhiker
they must be using some sort of stealth technology
i wonder how long theyve been there
long enough to throw half our systems out of whack im sure they know weve detected them open hailing frequencies
our shiptoship sensors are malfunctioning i can only give you audio translators active
this is captain jonathan archer of the starship enterprise i dont need to tell you where we are your presence is disrupting a number of our systems please back away to a distance of at least ten kilometres and respond
harm us  your request we ask you not to harm us we are complying with your request we ask you not to harm us
theyre moving off sir
we have no intention of harming you but i wouldnt mind an explanation
i apologise for any damage weve caused our engines are malfunctioning and weve been using your plasma exhaust to replenish our teraphasic coils its allowed us to share your warp field
their warp reactor is offline
we cant help you unless we can see you so why dont you disconnect whatever stealth device youre using
im giving you forty milligrams of mirazine  it should shorted the decompression process by half
that still leaves three hours can you recommend a good book
ill be briefing you on their propulsion systems
sure you dont want me coming back at night
three hours of decompression in each direction makes more sense to stay until the jobs done
ive sent them your dietary requirements
they claim to have the ability to synthesize protein and carbohydrates but theres no telling what it may taste like try to be diplomatic
three days on an alien ship
remember to mind your manners
weve got a seal
just about ready
its too bad the shiptoship sensors are down would have been nice to get a look at them
ill just think of it as a blind date tucker to enterprise
archer
here i go sir
keep your comm channel open well be right here
here you go
dont forget to come back for me
i dont know we are kind of busy have fun
hello
hello
try to maintain your normal rate of respiration
this stuffs burning my lungs
maintain your normal rate of respiration the discomfort will subside
commander tuckers calling again sir hes rather anxious
put him through
how longs it been sir
about five minutes longer than the last time you asked
hows the breathing
a lot easier but i prefer air i cant see
they told us the air would clear up during the last half hour of decompression
i feel like ive been in here for a week
youve only got forty five minutes to go trip
be patient
hey good boy there you go
blue one green three yellow two orange five yellow three red four green two whoa whoa thats too fast im not a computer
i hope the acclamation process wasnt too stressful
blue three yellow six orange four
the perceptual tests are the best way to determine whether youre ready for our environment
weve prepared a meal for you
not right now thank you
we strongly recommend that you get some rest
i think id like to take a look at that engine room of yours
its one deck above us
these are the teraphasic coils the wider ones have lost their cohesion
im sorry you lost me im having trouble concentrating with all this noise and light
are you certain you dont want to rest for a while
i dont know what im certain about
mister tucker again sir
put him through yeah trip hows it going
not good i dont think im going to be much help over here im having a little more trouble adjusting than i thought i would
whats the problem
i feel like ive got a fever im having trouble focusing breathing i really think i need to get back captain
stand by for a minute tpol put me through to trenal
stand by
captain archer
my mans not doing so well over there
hell be fine
with all due respect ive known commander tucker for eight years hes tough as nails if he says hes having problems ive got to believe him
when he came out of decompression he refused to rest i strongly suggest hed lie down for a while
you really think thatll make a difference
we have a good deal of experience with alien visitors
i told trenal youd try to get at least an hour of shuteye he says that should do the trick
i just want out sir im not kidding i cant take much more of this
trenal says theyve dealt with this before just one hour if youre not feeling better well bring you back
its not going to work captain
take a nap trip thats an order
archer out
weve prepared sleeping quarters for you its not far
your captain sent the recording  he thought it might help you relax are you feeling better
whats that
our food it grows all over the ship would you like some its very sweet
i think ill pass
this is the closest we could come to water
trust me
did that hurt
not really  its kind of nice does that happen when you people touch each other
something similar have you had enough
a man needs a lot of fluids when hes under the weather
if youre feeling well enough we really should get back to the repairs
could we take some of those with us
are the injector cells aligned with the primary coil
aligned and locked youre not going to believe this theyve got grass growing on the floor real grass its even green is vulcan grass green
have you tested the ion matrix commander
the grass releases some kind of vapour helps them metabolize their food smells just like a freshly mowed lawn
the ion matrix commander
oh right ive recharged the assembly is it up to point four yet
point four three
keep pumping up the gradient if we can get it up to point five the coils should come back online
all by themselves
sounds like trips feeling better
before you know it hell have that engine room running like a welloiled machine
tucker to captain archer
go ahead trip
were nearly ready to bring the warp reactor online shouldnt take more than a couple of hours
just think yesterday you would have done anything to get out of there
tucker out
it will take a while for the coils to regenerate come with me theres something i want you to see
watch this
thats thera its where i come from
the depth perception is incredible what is it a 3d simulator of some kind
its holographic
not like any hologram ive ever seen
it seems real doesnt it
how do you
resequenced photons come with me
the perspectives changing
we could walk all the way to the city and youd never know were still in this room
sit down
were still in the same room and this isnt a boat
its a boat its just resequenced
resequenced photons
exactly
if we had one of these on enterprise id never ask for shore leave
you dont have any dermal plating how do you detect other peoples moods
we dont well actually we do but we do it through observing behaviour getting to know someone
the follicles on your face if im not mistaken theyve grown do they have a purpose
not that i know of normally we shave them off with something called a razor but i havent had the chance since ive been here
do you mind
go ahead
does that hurt
not in the least
more water
no this is a game we play watch
go ahead
are there any rules to this game
it takes four hands to work
your favourite food is catfish
how the hell did you know that
whats mine
your what favourite food
yes concentrate whats my favourite food
dutara root howd i know that
i wasnt certain the granules would work with your species captain archer saved your life once about four years ago
this is one hell of a game you find me attractive
you like having people find you attractive dont you
sometimes
reactor room to ahlen the coils are coming back online
understood youd better stand up
decompression any easier coming back
three hours is three hours you cant imagine what it was like over there travis food growing on the walls teraphasic warp coils boxes full of pebbles that make you telepathic
what were the xyrillians like
a little shorter than us weird scales on their faces but otherwise pretty much like you and me it sure was something reminded me why i signed on but it is good to be home
i hope your mission hasnt been overly delayed
getting a chance to meet other species is our mission
i see youve got the visual back online
hoshi trenal wanted to thank you again
 i realise how difficult it must have been adapting to our environment
it was worth every minute as long as those coils stay charged you shouldnt have a problem maintaining a stable warp field  thanks for taking care of me when i wasnt feeling so hot
it was worth every minute good luck to you
nice work commander
i appreciate the opportunity commander
i for one wont miss the malfunctions their proximity was causing
return to our previous heading travis
aye sir
didnt they feed you over there
you shouldve come with me malcolm
i heard about the holographic recreation
it wasnt like any visual simulator ive ever tried it was more like actually being there you could smell the ocean feel the salt air on your skin
if we had one of those on board i can only imagine what it would be used for
i dont know if they can recreate people with it but it sure did a hell of a job on landscapes
make any friends
ahlen one of their engineers shes the one who showed me the holographic chamber
is she the one you thanked for taking care of you
yeah
interesting scales
she did have a certain sensuality to her
so did you get a look at their weapons
i dont even know if they had any have you tried these scrambled eggs tastes just like the real thing today
maybe you were allergic to something over there
well i cleared bioscan
nevertheless youd better have doctor phlox take a look at it
as far as i know ive never been allergic to anything
i dont believe youre having an allergic reaction tell me did your visit to the xyrillian ship involve any romance
what
were you intimate with anyone
doc i was over there to repair a warp reactor what are you talking about
it seems you did a little more than repair work
meaning
this is a nipple
i beg your pardon
ah the blastocyst is located between the sixth and seventh intercostals
what the hell are you talking about
im not quite sure if congratulations are in order commander but youre pregnant
heredo you see that cell cluster that is the embryoi assume youll be happy to know that its not technically your child
what do you mean
when reproducing the xyrillians only utilize the genetic material of the mother the males simply serve as hosts
thats comforting but how the hell did i get knocked up
we dont have any data on their mating procedures but i wouldnt think it would be that difficult for you to recollect a sexual encounter
three days you were only there for three days and you couldnt restrain yourself
im telling you captain i was a complete gentleman the entire time
i imagine thats a question of how you would define gentleman
the only female i had any contact with was ahlen their engineer other than repairing the reactor all she and i did together was go into that holographic chamber theyve got she showed me some home movies simulations of their planet but i didnt lay a hand on her theres got to be some way to get this thing out of me without hurting it cant you create a surrogate chamber or something
the embryo has integrated with your pericardium i wouldnt be comfortable extracting it without more information on the gestation process
this engineer wanted you to see her planet
so
perhaps the next step would have been to meet her holographic parents if im not mistaken on some planets thats a precursor to marriage
we took a ride in a row boat i swear captain nothing happened
there had to be a somewhat lengthy physical contact to transfer this much genetic material
trip
ive been in starfleet for twelve years do you think id jeopardise my career by messing around with some alien engineer on a three day mission i considered myself a diplomat from the minute i set foot in that vessel well there was that box of pebbles
pebbles
yeah she had it on the boat but it was no bid deal we just stuck our hands into these granules for a few minutes its a game they play lets you read each others minds they werent even real they were holographic just like everything else in the room
doctor
without a sample of these telepathic granules it would be impossible to make a determination but they could have served as the transferral medium
one of the first things a diplomat learns is not to stick his fingers where they dont belong
captain
if were going to safely remove this life form from commander tucker well have to find the xyrillians  why dont you and malcolm see what you can do about locating their ship
yes sir
is trip well enough to return to his duties
what are you kidding im fine
youll probably feel a bit nauseated in the mornings so get sufficient rest and exercise and see me at least once a day that nipple may not be the only surprise your body has in store for you
you think we could keep this between the four of us at least for the time being
you got it
dillard
sir
look at this lift
sir
its an accident waiting to happen this safety bars a metre off the floor what use would it be for a small person
a small person
a short alien a child this things a deathtrap
look at this handrail put your hands here while this is going up or down itll take your fingers right off
why would someone put their hands there sir
never mind
are you certain you made the correct sensor modifications
yes absolutely certain their last trajectory
weve altered our course to match
how do we know they havent changed their heading
we dont but weve compensated to detect their stealth telemetry we should be able to locate them
it may take a while why exactly are we trying to find that ship
yes i thought you provided all the services they required
if youll excuse me im not feeling very well
perhaps a little lunch might help i hear chef has prepared rigelian sausage  being vegetarian i cant speak from experience but im told its quite succulent
i think im just going to go lie down for a while
commander if we tune the uv sensors to the omicron band we should be able to isolate their plasma trail a good deal faster do you think you could spare a minute just to help me recalibrate them
im afraid this isnt a very good time
sorry im late
no problem how you feeling
i thought we all promised to keep this under wraps
i havent said a thing doctor
not a word
i knew it she probably let it slip the minute she left sickbay
but subcommander tpol promised to keep your pregnancy a secret
where im from vulcans arent known for keeping promises
well what makes you think shes told anyone
all you have to do is see the way they whisper talk behind my back you know what happened this morning ensign hart pulled my chair out for me im telling you it was tpol and you can be sure it was intentional whats that
chicken tetrazzini
did you cut yourself
i wish i dont want to ruin you appetites but take a look at this
just how many of these am i going to grow and while were on the subject are they going to go away again afterward
one would think then again i have no experience with this species
great
you know its been over a week trip we have to start considering the possibility that were not going to find the xyrillians
whats that supposed to mean are you saying im going to deliver this baby
i believe hes saying a good deal more than that once the child is born it may well rely on you in some way to care for it
im the chief engineer i spent years earning that position i never had any intention of becoming a working mother
you know the doctor was saying that the gestation period will only last another five weeks six at the most
you should expect to begin experiencing some unusual symptoms hormonal changes mostly mood swings heightened emotions
i suggest you stick with the civilian clothes seems to help hide the bulge
how much bigger is this thing going to get im already the laughing stock of the ship
id love some more of this
yes sir
id like you to start seeing the doctor every eight hours as your delivery date gets closer he should be able to start figuring out what your postnatal responsibilities might be
postnatal responsibilities
you may very well be putting those nipples to work before you know it
theres a bright side to all of this
yeah whats that
as far as we know this is the first interspecies pregnancy involving a human
got something
looks like their signature
coordinates oh seven eight mark six three million kilometres change our heading to intercept bridge to archer
go ahead
we may have found the xyrillian ship sir
thank you
on our way
what have you got
were approaching the coordinates ive analysed the stealth telemetry i believe its them
drop down to impulse hoshi try to get an image
doesnt look very stealthy to me
go tighter
if the starship profiles the vulcans gave us are correct
theyre correct lieutenant thats a klingon battle cruiser
where the hell are the xyrillians
it appears your repairs didnt last very long if im correct theyre hiding in the klingons plasma wake
hoshi
the translation programme should be in pretty good shape sir
sir with all due respect do we really think this is a wise idea
if were going to speak to the xyrillians we cant do it without the klingons knowing about it open a channel this is captain archer of the starship enterprise we respectfully would like to ask for your assistance with a little problem were having
sir theyre charging weapons
polarize the hull plating
grab hold of something
and another one
why are they attacking us
theyre not if they wanted to destroy enterprise they would have done it
so i guess thats their version of a warning shot across our bows
i dont recommend being the recipient of another warning like that sir
should i lay in a new course captain
no stay where you are hail them again
sir look at their starboard nacelle the powers fluctuating just like ours did when the xyrillians were riding in our wake
theyre responding
what gives you the right to approach a klingon warship
please accept our apology but i need to ask you a question
and what would that be
have you been experiencing any unusual malfunctions problems with your gravity plating propulsion environmental controls
youve been monitoring our systems for how long
we havent i promise you the same things happened to us a few days ago your problems are being caused by a small stealth vessel thats been riding in your wake theyre using your plasma exhaust to fuel their warp coils
find this vessel
wait a minute wait a minute theyre harmless we need them alive just give me a chance to explain
find them
there are thirty six aboard
bring their captain to me and execute the others
didnt you hear what i said i need them alive
what you need is to turn your puny ship around and leave these aliens violated our security and disrupted our systems both are considered acts of war against the empire
i assure you that any damage theyve done was unintentional theyre simply trying to get home
they wont get home but im more than willing to hasten their journey to stovokor
stovo
the afterlife
you really dont want to hurt these people theyre actually very kind they just had some bad luck with their engines when we confronted them they complied with all our requests
youre wasting my time
less than one month ago captain archer stood in the high council chamber in kronos the chancellor himself called him a man of honour a brother enterprise is the ship that found klaang and returned him to the empire without klaang your houses would be at war with each other jonathan archer is the man who carried out that rescue you are in his debt you would be demonstrating both honour and wisdom to grant his request
im the one who repaired their warp reactor or at least i thought i did i spent three days on their ship they have some amazing technology if you dont kill them im sure theyd share it with you teach you how to use it
what kind of technology
well for one theyve got some incredible holography i dont know how advanced klingon holograms are but these are like nothing i ever saw before press a few buttons and youll be standing on a hillside overlooking kronos its unbelievable couldnt hurt to take a look unless the decompression cycle frightens you
i am frightened by nothing petaq
if you agree to enter their vessel id appreciate it if you took my chief engineer with you
he talks too much ill bring a security team
he was there for three days they trust him itll make things a lot easier
if their technology amuses me i may spare their lives i dont need your engineer to help me make that decision
theres another reason commander tucker has some unfinished business with the xyrillians
i am not interested in your engineers business
theres a pregnancy involved
i thought you said you were there to fix their warp reactor not to impregnate one of their females this should be a lesson to you forget it happened
im afraid thats not going to be so easy
show him
captain vorok has agreed to consider releasing your ship in exchange for one or two of your holographic simulators it would be a good idea to cooperate
this is a topographical survey of our capital
id be pleased to give you a demonstration
the reactor worked fine for six days then went offline again how did you find us
it wasnt easy but we were very motivated
i dont understand
i had no idea this could happen with another species if id known
no need to apologise but i would be real appreciative if you could get this out of me assuming its safe
its still early enough to transfer the embryo to another host she looks very healthy
its a girl huh
you can see my house from here can this technology be adapted to our power matrix
im sure we can make the appropriate modifications
as soon as the installation is complete the xyrillians will be free to go
i appreciate your cooperation i hope the next time we meet we can be of some help to you
listen to me very carefully our debt is repaid we have no interest in meeting you again and if we do i promise youll regret it
the only thing worse than spending three hours in a decompression chamber with a bunch of klingons is doing it twice in one day i smelled things in there i hope i never smell again
trenal told me that at full impulse they can probably get home in less than a month
no more hitchhiking
that business about the klingon chancellor calling me a brother was that true
klingons are known to exaggerate i saw nothing wrong with doing the same
your appetite seems to be back to normal
just eating for one again
ive run a check through the starfleet database you might be pleased to know that this is the first recorded incident of a human male becoming pregnant
just how i always wanted to get into the history books
this was their first view of it
if you dont look too close youd think it was earth
breaking ground on the town hall
is that captain mitchell
no i think thats mitchell
are we there yet
three hours seventeen minutes to go sir
travis has been digging through the archives
theres tons of data here crew manifests survey photos weekly status reports i was hoping to find something a clue to what happened
youd be the first
ive been fascinated by terra nova since i was a kid sir i always thought lost colonies affected boomers more than anyone else something about people who choose to live offworld
captain do you think anyones still there
ill let you know in about three hours and seventeen minutes
terra nova
im surprised youve never heard of it
im not familiar with the early years of human space exploration
really every school kid on earth had to learn about the famous vulcan expeditions
name one
history was never my best subject
it was called the great experiment could humans colonise deep space theyd already build new berlin on the moon utopia planetia on mars even a few asteroid colonies but all within our solar system when they found an earthlike planet less than twenty lightyears away it was hard to resist
it took them what nine years to get there
nine years there nine years back but they made it
my grandfather remembered seeing their first transmissions when he was a kid
what happened to them
people have been trying to answer that question for a long time no ones heard from terra nova in over seventy years after the colony was built relations with earth became strained the space agency figured nothing succeeds like success so they decided to send another vessel
the colonists protested theyd been there five years this was their home they didnt want another two hundred people arriving the folks back on earth argued that there werent any other habitable planets within reach but the colonists dug their heels in there were a few angry messages sent back and forth then one day nobody heard from them again
why didnt you send a vessel to find out what happened
nine years there nine years back it would have been a pretty long trip
a vulcan ship could have made the journey in far less time why didnt you ask them
asking favours of the vulcans usually ends up carrying too high a price
my experience with humans is limited but ive come to learn that theyre quite resourceful terra nova may still be there captain
two hundred thousand kilometres
lets see it
i promised my dad id see this place someday
put us in orbit over the colony
terra nova colony this is captain jonathan archer of the starship enterprise weve come from earth please respond
no answer sir
any biosigns
no but the colony appears to be intact im also detecting low levels of surface radiation
from what
i cant tell
lets take a look
closer
looks like a ghost town
lets hope the ghosts can give us some answers how bad is the radiation
less than eight hundred millirads a few hours of exposure shouldnt pose a risk
trip take the bridge travis
a housing unit
no sign of weapons fire only rust
whatever happened ive got to believe they tried to let earth know about it
weve got the schematics for the communications tower
good see if the data buffers intact we might be able to access their last transmission logs
aye sir
walk the perimeter see what you can find
judging by the isotope decays the radiation levels seventy years ago would have been lethal
if thats what killed them where are the bodies
maybe they left the planet before it could affect them
that would have been difficult thats a bulkhead they designed their ship to be disassembled thats how they built the colony it was a oneway trip
hello
were not alone sir theres someone in the forest
were on our way
i believe he went in there
you get a look at him
yeah he appeared to be a couple of metres tall biped oddlooking scales
this leads to a network of caverns that extend for several hundred metres
archer to mayweather
go ahead sir
get back to the shuttle and grab a pair of flashlights make it quick
yes sir
itd be best if i went first sir
after you
captain
my name is archer were looking for some people i was hoping you could help us  were not going to hurt you were just trying to find out what happened to them
which way
tpol to captain archer
captain
were under attack and i think we just took a wrong turn we could use a little help navigating down here
just a moment in approximately three metres a tunnel will branch off to your left
take it
i dont see a tunnel
correction ten metres
im all right sir
malcolm
malcolm
wheres malcolm
go
take us up
if those aliens killed the colonists they could kill malcolm too
those werent aliens theyre human
i dont get it if theyre human why were they shooting at us
archer to the bridge what have you found
weve got a
pretty good picture of those caverns and weve picked up fifty two biosigns so far all human
the only one im interested in right now is lieutenant reed weve got to get him out of there
have you found him
yes sir hes about ninety metres below the surface
hes not responding to hails captain but hes alive
have doctor phlox join us in the situation room
aye sir
if these are the descendants of the original colonists theyve never seen other humans before maybe we look as strange to them as they did to us
twelve point six kilometres worth of tunnels looks like they even dug a few wells the geologys a little shaky some of these passageways have collapsed
they may have been driven underground by the radiation
have you figured out what caused it
not yet
what do they do for food
many species feed on underground fauna and flora tubers fungi insects
they also hunt some kind of burrowing animal wheres malcolm
right here sir there are two people with him
can we use the transporter
hes too deep
a section of this tunnel is collapsed its empty if we could get into it we could clear the obstruction with phase pistols wed be less than twenty metres from lieutenant reed
what about these two we have to assume theyre armed
a stun grenade would solve that problem
i dont want to risk any more casualties despite how they look theyre still human weve got to find some way to talk to them
they didnt seem too eager to talk
if i cant make first contact with other humans i dont have any business being out here malcolm was shot grab your medical kit and meet me at the launch bay
right away sir
captain
try to find out what irradiated the surface you and hoshi get to work on that data buffer i want to know if they tried to send any messages to earth
do you think they know weve returned
hard not to hear a shuttlepod landing on your roof
im unarmed i just want to talk
im concerned about my officer id like to see him
fancy meeting you here
hows the leg
ive lost a bit of blood sir but i dont think its too serious
may i have my medical supplies please
human
thats right
whats that
my name is phlox i am a denobulan im captain archers physician
you tracked from earth on a sky ship
its called enterprise
to what gut the rest of us
no were here to find out what happened to the colony we came to help you
novans have had enough help from you
were not so easy to hunt as diggers go back to the overside or well seal your passage
i told you were not here to hurt anybody
take that one and dont track back
all right but he wont be able to get through these tunnels on one leg my doctor needs to treat him
what makes you think were here to hurt you
humans hurt novans
why do you think that
they gutted us our families our beforefamilies
i dont understand
poison rain i was no taller than a digger but i can still see back we lived on the overside then the humans dropped the poison burned our skin gutted the grown ones there was no place to go but here
to the underside i think i know what youre talking about the poison rain it was some kind of radiation i dont know what caused it but im sure it wasnt humans
he can walk more or less but ill need to get him back to sickbay to remove the projectile
i know thisll be hard for you to accept but youre the descendants of human beings your ancestors colonised this planet over seventy years ago they came from earth just like i did i dont know what happened but maybe we could work together and find out
he speaks in shale
if thats your way of calling me a liar give me a chance to prove what im saying my sky ship has tools that can help us find out what happened here
no
are you aware that your mother is sick
this is one of the tools the captain spoke of it can tell me all kinds of things about the inside of your body she has an illness that we call lung cancer but its easily cured
doctor phlox can make her well but shed have to come back to our ship
this is shale they want to trap us on the overside to gut us
how long of a day would it take
not long a few hours at most
hours
shed be back before the sun rises on the overside let us help you
we track together this one stays
he needs to be treated as well
hell be fine for a few hours
dont worry about me sir i was just getting used to the place
probably best if you lead the way
thats enterprise its a lot like the ship that brought the colonists to this planet it was called the conestoga maybe you were born on board or were you born after your parents got here
my parents were novans they came from the overside
no more let me out
open the passage
just a few more seconds
open it
its all right
my apologies for any discomfort
is she healed
not quite first we have to determine how far her sickness has spread
that is you the inside of you anyway this picture will tell me what kind of treatment shell require interstitial tumours the malignancy has spread to her lymphatic system shell need a series of cytolitic injections
injections
medicine hes just going to give her some medicine
ill need a few minutes to synthesise it
ive got some other pictures you might like to see one of my crewmen found these in our database
they might help you remember what it was like living on the overside before the poison rain
its human shale theyre confusing your path youll lose your tracks in this
im just trying to help you see how you got here
all i see is digger filth
well look again because whether you want to believe it or not were both human
bury your drawings
doctor keep me posted
how far away is it
about five hundred kilometres north
how deep
its been partially filled in by erosion over the years but im reading impact fractures down to nearly two thousand metres
comet or an asteroid
an asteroid a large one the tectonic analysis puts the impact at approximately seventy years ago
the poison rain
the geology was comprised primarily of beresium ore the thermoshock would have created a radioactive cloud that probably covered the northern hemisphere for more than a year
they spent all those years getting here and for what
thats an old mk33 isnt it or is it a 34 impressive body armour youre wearing did you make it yourself right i dont suppose theres a lavatory on the premises is there i wouldnt mind freshening up a little no didnt think so
is your belly hollow
that all depends whats for dinner
digger meat
looks a little undercooked
humans are like damp moss they rot on the underside
not bad
come in
its a transmission sir its the last one anyone made as far as we can tell it was still in the buffer
its captain mitchell
no matter how angry logans threats may have seemed there had to have been a way of dealing with this other than attacking us nearly half the adults are dead including doctor tracey and everyone else is getting sick except for the younger children if they have any chance of surviving the least you could do is have the vulcans send a ship for them but for all i know they were the ones you talked into attacking us you wanted terra nova enough to do this well its yours now but i doubt youll be very pleased with what you find when you get here
mark logan was the head of the opposition the ones who were against a second wave of settlers supposedly he threatened to fire at any ship that came into orbit
the irony is that captain mitchells message never reached earth the debris in the atmosphere was too dense
so for some reason the young kids survive and begin living underground their last memories of their parents are hearing them blame humans for destroying the colony the idea that humans are the enemy has been embedded in them for more than two generations this isnt going to be easy
sickbay to archer
go ahead
could you come see me please
is everything all right
nadets cancer has been eliminated
nice work
but i found something quite troubling both she and her son are showing signs of microcellular decay in their endocrine systems their underground water supply has probably become contaminated i dont have any medication to treat this and its only going to get worse
would bringing them to the surface help
tpol says the soil and foliage is going to remain irradiated for at least another decade
hows she doing
shes as disagreeable as she was before i treated her
bring them to the situation room
we are not leaving
its not safe for you anymore when the asteroid hit the fallout contained certain poisons humans under the age of four or five can usually build up an immunity to them thats why they survived
for the last two or three generations that immunity kept you all alive but now the poisons have gotten into your water supply as captain archer says it is no longer safe
you humans tried to gut our gobefores when they lived on the overside now youre trying to gut us
doctor phlox just saved your life perhaps you should give him the benefit of the doubt after all hes not human neither am i
giant rocks falling from the sky shale its all shale take us back
i went through about two to three hundred photographs before i found this
look familiar nadet
its the overside before the poison rain
and what about the people
humans
what were humans doing in your colony before it was destroyed i think i can help answer that
youre sure none of these people look familiar from the data we retrieved on this photograph were pretty sure this womans name was vera fuller ring a bell
its the medicine they put in you theyre confusing your path we need to leave
look closely
vera fuller what do you remember
shale theyre trying to trap you
vera had a daughter named bernadette shed be about seventy five now in earth years
nadet bernadette you say this is me
theyre trying to make us leave the underside if were not back before day your crewman will be gutted take us back
is her treatment finished
i should take one more thoracic scan
fine as soon as youre done bring them to the launch bay subcommander
there are fifty eight human beings in those tunnels and theyre all going to die if we dont get them out of it and what do they think they think were a bunch of hostile aliens trying to take their colony over
stun grenades
what
commander tuckers continued to enhance the sensor resolution of their tunnels we could transport stun grenades to specific locations detonate them and use both shuttlepods to bring them back to the ship
and then what put them in chains
im sure mister reed could devise appropriate restraints
what the hell do you think this is a slave shi we cant relocate them by force
the alternative was made quite clear by doctor phlox
we have to convince them that returning to earth is the right thing we cant take them by force
are you certain it is the right thing
what are you talking about
when you get them back to earth what will you do send them to school teach them to read and write wear human clothing eat human food teach them to live on the surface enjoy the sunshine
youre damn straight theyre human beings its their birthright it might take a little while but theyll adapt its a hell of a lot better than dying down in those tunnels
theyve lived in those tunnels for three generations you cant just pluck them up and bring them to a strange world and hope theyll learn to conform youd be destroying their identity destroying the novan culture
archer to tucker
captain
get up here on the double and bring your maps with you
the debris cloud reached to about here ten or twelve degrees north of the equator
southern hemisphere
unaffected by the asteroid
captain archer
go ahead doc
the two novans are in shuttlepod one will you be escorting them back to the surface
ill be there in a couple of minutes theres got to be similar underground topography on one of these southern continents caves caverns find them put that on a padd for me and it wouldnt hurt if they were crawling with those what do they call them diggers
your planet has three large islands to the south we call them continents the climate is nearly identical to your overside we dont know how similar the underside is but my people are working on that now the important thing is the poison rain never fell there youd be safe your children would be safe you could even spend time on the overside if you wanted to
if our tunnels are infected you wouldnt want them so badly
we dont we only want to help you make you healthy
was that photograph of vera fuller and her daughter shale do you really believe we created it to trick you youre human so am i humans help each other
when we track back to the underside well return your crewman only if you promise to leave
ive got the landing site locked in captain
would you at least talk to your people tell them what i proposed
our thrusters are down
fire them up again
pod one to enterprise weve got an emergency
is anyone hurt
were okay but getting out of here is going to be tricky can you give us the coordinates
captain
i think were done dropping how far have we gone
youre down about eight metres looks like a couple of the abandoned tunnels gave way
open it open it
hold on trip if i open the port hatch what am i going to find
open it
youre on the floor of a stable tunnel you should be okay
youre going to have to build a rig to get this pod back on the surface
aye sir
were in the downslope passage we need to pass the cutthrough to get to your crewman give me your pistol
what are you talking about
if you want to see your human alive youll give me your pistol
stay here with the shuttle keep your comm open
help
hold on a second do you hear that
help help me can anyone
its akary
help help
he must have fallen when your sky ship quaked the tunnels are you hurt
im legbroke the wood has me sealed down
would you risk your bones to save a novan
ill do what i can but i doubt i can make it down there
well track together but youll need to trust me
the waters rising we have to hurry
i need you to give me my phase pistol my gun
why so you can go free your hostage
so i can free this man its your turn to trust me
give me a hand ready
captain
how are you holding up
not badly all things considered but i really wouldnt mind getting this bullet out of my leg
tell them tell them what archer said about the islands to the south
they promised to leave let them go well be fine here
were not fine none of us is fine were rotting all of us
theyve promised to leave
ive seen back vera fuller was my mother that girl in the picture was me a human girl our gobefores shared the same path we should listen
ever heard of judge crater
crater
disappeared in the early twentieth century how about amelia earhart
no
1937 never found a trace of her a lot of people spent years decades trying to figure out what happened to them but neither of those mysteries holds a candle to terra nova and we solved it
did more than that those people were a year or two away from extinction we didnt just find them we saved their lives
all these years wondering about that colony i never thought id become part of their history
tell you what travis why dont you put together the report for starfleet if im not mistaken itll be headline news back home
the terra nova puzzle solved at last as told by ensign travis mayweather
thank you sir
maybe its just me but it seems like these vulcan star charts take all the fun out of it were supposed to be explorers arent we
thats the general idea
wheres the exploration in going places people have already been
well for one thing weve never been to these places for another remember that protostar we ran across last week
yeah
im not seeing it here
are you saying those vulcan star charts arent all that accurate if thats true good luck getting them to admit it
come in
you wanted to see me captain
as a matter of fact mister tucker and i were looking at these star charts theres a planet a few light years off our current heading
im familiar with it
well the data indicates theres a remote outpost right here on the northern hemisphere
pjem
i take it this pjem is under vulcan jurisdiction
its an ancient spiritual retreat a remote sanctuary for kolinahr and peaceful meditation
kolinahr
the vulcan purging of emotion
that sounds interesting how do you think theyd feel about a visit
pjem is a place of quiet contemplation captain im not certain wed be welcome
its because vulcans think we smell bad isnt it
its not every day we get a chance to see an ancient vulcan monastery id say a stopovers too good a chance to pass up unless you disagree
ill research the proper protocols
good archer to helm
go ahead
prepare to lay in a course correction tpol will give you the coordinates
understood
well you must be looking forward to visiting the sanctuary
it was the captains idea
but such an opportunity to appreciate your cultural history
it is a vulcan sanctuary if thats what you mean
precisely my point youll be able to introduce some of your own people to your new crew oh i believe i see the source of your misgivings being seen with a human crew
it could create a certain awkwardness
may i
i confess i feel awkward on this ship myself sometimes out of place but what is that vulcan motto infinite diversity
in infinite combinations
and what is diversity but a celebration of differences i wonder if you might remind me about our mission on this vessel please indulge me
our mission is to make contact with those whom humans consider new life and new civilisations
in other words to seek infinite diversity
i suppose so
well then it seems to me a cultural exchange between your vulcan brethren and your human crew is simply a furtherance of that mission
they dont even know were coming
it wasnt possible to hail them the monks consider technology a distraction from their spiritual pursuits
i dont like dropping in on people unannounced
it wont be a problem as long as we observe the proper protocols when we arrive well be greeted by a vulcan elder you should not speak to him or any member of the order unless spoken to first if they appear to be meditating do not approach them or attempt to make conversation also maintain quiet at all times and do not touch or disturb any artefacts relics or ornamentation if we arrive at their time of communal kolinahr its likely well be turned away at the conclusion of our visit well be offered the stone of jkah as a gesture of salutation accept it then bow slightly and observe a respectful silence for approximately five seconds
i thought starfleet training was tough
you say this is a place to purge emotions looks like somebody had to purge pretty bad he bashed the door in
the temple is almost three thousand years old commander you cant expect it to be in pristine condition
he says we have arrived at the time of kolinahr the order must remain in silent reflection throughout the lunar cycle they are not to be disturbed
oh thats too bad at least we got to see the place
your service honours us before we leave may i request the offering of the jkah stone for my distinguished guests
please wait
something wrong
its probably nothing
but
this is the main atrium there should be more than one member of the order present and the icon in that shrine is perched at an odd angle
oddly perched huh wed better call starfleet command
thats not all captain the vulcan elder seems agitated
you call that agitated
you know i think the oldest monastery i ever visited was in ngari tibet but it wasnt nearly as big as this place
ive heard it can take days to explore this site
itd take at least that long to clean the place up
forgive the disarray kolinahr encourages the members of our order to face their vestigial emotions the repercussions can sometimes be violent please this is the stone of jkah which represents the foundation of all we believe a life of order and control through logic
ishte acula bestalma itok jkah
whats all that mean anyway
it is a traditional litany passed down for generations
does it mean i get good luck or something
youre thinking of the blarney stone captain or when you pat the buddhas belly
i guess youre right too bad we didnt bring a camera huh commander
please you must leave now
you ever been to san francisco zoo now theres something you should see
friends of yours somehow i didnt think so
stop looking at me
okay okay dont get your antennas in a twist
why didnt you tell us one of your people was aboard
its an earth vessel i didnt know
what does that mean earth what is that
its where were from its our homeworld
why did you come here answer me pink skin
this planet was along our course we only came to visit the sanctuary
liar whats your mission are you a supply ship bringing them more surveillance equipment
were not bringing them anything
you brought her
shes my science officer
so you admit youre working with the vulcans
ill admit i have a vulcan science officer and that i came here out of curiosity now if you dont mind my asking what are you doing here
hey hes telling the truth we came for a visit thats all
we scanned your ship in orbit youre very well armed for people who came for a visit you and the pink skins have proven what we already knew this is far more than a sanctuary
ill enjoy having you as a prisoner
now these guys are agitated
theyre andorians captain theyre known for their suspicious and volatile nature
andorians
yes sir
our two species are from neighbouring systems weve been in conflict for many years
they resent our superior reasoning and our technology they even believe that we intend to mount an invasion on their homeworld
in order to alleviate tensions we negotiated a treaty but some andorian factions still believe were bent on conquest
what do they want with a three thousand year old temple
they believe we are hiding a long range sensor array this is a place of introspection captain there are no spies her and no technology
so what are you going to do just sit here and let them ransack the place
typically they make a great display of their indignance when they find nothing they leave
the andorians were here twice before and both times left within a day unfortunately your arrival has amplified their suspicions
youve endangered us all
no good deed goes unpunished
the shuttles sensors should have picked it up
they went to visit some monks why would they scan for alien ships
it should be standard procedure thats why in any event there it is
there what is
a vessel not vulcan and its less than one kilometre from our shuttlepod
not a lot of room on that landing platform maybe theyre just some other visitors
well i for one would like to know who these visitors are and why havennt we heard from the landing party
you cant expect them to check in every ten minutes
maybe that should be standard procedure as well
you sure youre not overreacting theyre probably just taking a tour observing some kind of meditation ritual
wheres the sensor array
from what im told there isnt one
where is it
i dont know
you humans obviously have emotions i find it curious that youd select a vulcan as your science officer
believe me she wasnt my first choice
why a vulcan
why a vulcan
she was assigned to us by the vulcan high command
you take orders from the high command
no for the last time we just came to see the temple  thats my ship enterprise theyre trying to contact me
enterprise
yes im looking for captain archer
hes a prisoner of the andorian imperial guard we know youre in collaboration with the vulcans
let me talk to the captain
your ship
is under constant surveillance arm your weapons or make any attempt to approach the surface and ill kill the hostages
wait
ive lost the signal
try tpol or commander tucker
no response
have the launch bay put shuttlepod two on standby
you heard what he said if we try to send more people
i dont take orders from a comm voice ensign not unless that voice belongs to the captain take a look at the vulcan database see if it has anything on these andorians
aye sir
weve searched all the chambers in the eastern tower
have you checked the living quarters
not yet
perhaps if we decapitate one or two of those monks hell start telling us the truth
is that something you could live with captain
ive already told you the truth
how long have you lived on the earth ship
nine weeks and four days
the smell must be intolerable
you get used to it and i was given a nasal numbing agent
whose idea was it to visit this place these guys are serious theyre going to start killing you people if they dont find what theyre looking for
there is nothing to find
i dont think theyre buying that not this time loks like there are four of them i saw some kind of scanning console they talked a lot about searching rooms
youd think they could find whatever it is theyre looking for with those antennas of theirs
they answered a hail from enterprise they threatened to kill us all if anyone attempts a rescue
mister reed wouldnt be that reckless
i didnt recruit my tactical officer to sit on his butt when hes threatened the andorians smashed our communicators the longer were out of contact the more likely malcolm will put together a landing party warning or no warning
knowing him a heavily armed landing party
its just a matter of time so if anyone has a suggestion im all ears no offence
there is an option a transmitter its very old
you said you had no technology
it hasnt been used in many years it may not even be working
i never met a busted radio i couldnt fix
where is this transmitter
in the catacombs
catacombs
please listen to me captain there are hidden passages beneath us where we keep our most sacred relics our honoured dead if the andorians discover them they will damage our culture in ways you cant begin to understand
for people without emotion you sure have a flair for the dramatic
master haadok one of the founders of pjem the transmitter is this way
fellas
whats down there
the reliquary our most sacred artefacts are kept there this is the transmitter
looks like a krellide power cell
there is one to spare
no thanks itll just get in my way
its only going to get colder
you take it
you need it more than i do
do the andorians have a transporter
no
that gives us the element of surprise we could bring an assault team right into the atrium
the sound of the transporter alone would alert the guards theyd start firing before the team was fully resequenced
what about this room by the time the andorians detected the transport wed be armed and ready
for what a fire fight in close quarters with a dozen monks at risk
if youve got any better ideas
theres room in here
im fine
youre freezing
its been twenty four hours since i took my nasal numbing agent the cold is preferable to the odour
come on
an armed assault would put all of our lives at risk not to mention the destruction of the sanctuary itself
id say our lives are already at risk
tensions between andoria and vulcan are high any casualties would only make matters worse
it seems like youre letting them walk all over you they come in here they smash your relics they beat up your people then you just sit back and wait for them to walk away
we dont believe in responding to violence with violence
i admire your ethics but right now a little violence might help
youre beginning to sound like an andorian
you know i came here hoping to gain a little insight into the vulcan mind it looks like im getting it you people think youre so damned enlightened
problem id like to find a peaceful solution too but i dont think thats going to happen however we end up dealing with this i need to know i can count on you
are you questioning my loyalty
i just want to know where we stand
i have never disobeyed your orders
sir youre wearing a hole in the deck plating
what is it
transmission from the surface its a modulated em signal very weak
put it through
enterprise this is commander tucker repeat enterprise this is commander tucker
this is enterprise we can barely read you commander
whats your status
guess you heard we kind of walked into a hostage situation the whole place has been taken over by andorians
andorians yes
ive been reading about them in the vulcan database militaristic
blue skinned
thats them
well what do they want
they seem to think this place is some kind of a spy station
theyre looking for a sensor array the captain says to sit tight
he doesnt want to provoke them any more than we already have he also said to tell you were working on a way out of here
are you certain we cant negotiate
the captain came back from his last negotiation with a face full of bruises
well be in touch
understood
do any of these tunnels lead to the outside
no
what about this reliquary
no ones entered it in years
to do so would be blasphemy
i saw an old stairwell down there maybe a metre wide it was right about here
that would almost be directly beneath the atrium
there were three dim lights coming from the top it looked something like this
how many times do we have to search the same rooms
are you losing faith in our mission
weve looked everywhere weve run a thousand scans
the vulcans are very deceptive its here im sure of it if we back down now everything weve fought for is meaningless if nothing else remember that keval
hey can you hear me hello anybody out there
i need to speak with you alone i have some information for you
what is it
well for one thing i needed some fresh air you ever been stuck in a room full of vulcans for twelve hours
the information
ill bet their robes havent been washed since the time of surak have you heard of him vulcan philosopher hes the one who got everybody to start purging their emotions i dont know about you but ive learned really a lot since i got here
what did you come to tell us
well that depends what do you want to know all right information did you know that over seventy percent of the organisms on my homeworld are bacteria
what
and heres something i think youll find interesting there was a man in canton ohio who once rolled a ball of string over six metres in diameter
hes wasting our time take him back
there was a famous astronomer on earth
tycho brahe he lost his nose in a duel over a math equation
you must enjoy pain
please please i cant stand another minute with the vulcans please
a light at the end of the tunnel you know what to do commander
yes sir
i dont have to tell you captain we dont condone these actions you are about to take
no you dont have to tell me just try and stay out of the way and everything will work out fine
phase pistols on stun
stun sir
the captains instructions were quite explicit its a console ensign it wont bite
no itll just scramble your molecules
crewman
weve heard stories sir it might not be safe
ive heard the same stories now get up here coordinates set
aye sir
then energise before we change our minds
what is it
some kind of energy fluctuation
we detected an energy surge it came from this chamber
perhaps you have faulty equipment
or perhaps you have equipment we dont know about  watch them
this is it
most vulcans smell of dust but youre different
something sure smells
did you say something pink skin
this cant be right im detecting three new biosigns all human
where are they
theyre within twenty metres
where
i cant pinpoint the signal
try boosting the proximity sensors
ive heard about your mating rituals that vulcan women force their men to fight each other to the death would you like me to kill someone for you
leave her alone
would you like me to kill him
find them
theyre very close
will you be all right
go ahead ill cover here
keval
this way
two of them got away they went down into the catacombs
i hope youre pleased captain youve turned a place of solitude into a war zone
where are the phase pistols
here sir
if he wakes up stun him again lets go
im going with you
violence is no longer our way
we must protect what is ours
theyre down this passage thirty metres
it leads to the reliquary only members of the high order are allowed to go inside
well do our best not to look at anything
i cant permit it captain
what would you suggest we do
ill disarm them myself
you ever use one of those i didnt think so the andorians have seen your sacred relics a couple of humans wont make much of a difference
captain
hold your fire you might want to take a look at this
i dont believe this  does that thing have imaging sensors
yes
take all the pictures you can
place your weapons on the ground i will kill him if necessary give that to me
violence in a sanctuary captain
very disrespectful boy did it feel good all this time theyve been calling these monks liars and all this time theyve been right
theyve got enough equipment down there to see what any andorian is having for breakfast
ive completed my scans
give it to him
sir
give it to him
youve got what you came for now get out of here
how do we know you wont attack our vessel
the vulcans violated your treaty your people ought to know about it  you have a problem with that
your communicator
tpol to enterprise
go ahead
the andorian ship will be leaving the surface momentarily theyre free to go
acknowledged
were in your debt
thanks for the tour
looks like were going about warp four point five
human children have such fertile imaginations subcommander
these were sent by my nephews fourth grade class i thought the crew might like to see how excited folks at home are about our mission
im going to put this one up in sickbay would you like one for your quarters
this rendering is crude yet surprisingly accurate
some of these kids are pretty talented which one do you want this ones nice or maybe you want first contact or how about this one
were dropping out of warp
for those of you who arent near a window you might want to find one theres something pretty amazing off starboard
senior staff
please report to the bridge
ive checked the vulcan database sir no previous sightings
that means we discovered it
archers comet
take us closer ensign
aye sir
ever seen anything like that in your astronomy books
wow thats one big snowball
the diameter is eighty two point six kilometres
i always wanted to chase a comet maybe we should spend a few days following this one
vulcan and human scientists have researched hundreds of comets theyve proven to be little more than rock and ice
except this ones bigger than any comet humans have ever seen thats got to be worth a look stay with it travis
aye sir
milk cold
catching up on your reading
i came for a tea
stay away from the zariphean blend unless you want to stay up for the next three days
caffeine has little effect on vulcan physiology green tea hot
you want to join me i could use the company
im very tired
tell me about it i put out about a hundred fires in engineering this afternoon and missed dinner then somebody told me chef made a pecan pie and suddenly my life brightened its been my favourite since i was a kid care for a bite
no thank you
its delicious
its mostly sugar
what vulcans dont have a sweet tooth it may not be good for the body but it sure is good for the soul mmm i feel better already
must be a real page turner you all right
im fine commander goodnight
sweet dreams
eisilium
its an extremely rare mineral this comet appears to contain large quantities of it
ive never heard of eisilium
vulcan chemists have only obtained small amounts theyve never been able to study it in detail
this could be your chance can we collect a sample with the transporter
most of the eisilium deposits are at least twenty metres beneath the crust
thats too deep to get a lock
weve got the portable drilling rig sir
the comets certainly big enough to land on we could take a shuttlepod
id advise setting down near one of the two poles if youre out of direct sunlight the surface ice will be more stable
how long would you need
shouldnt take more than three or four hours
you up for a little comet walk
by all means
get started
captain im detecting a vessel closing on our position its vulcan
the starship timur
hail them this is captain jonathan archer of the starship enterprise
im captain vanik
pleased to meet you
youre a long way from earth captain are you lost
not at all just taking a look at this comet
our sensors detected it two days ago we also decided to investigate
really my science officer tells me that vulcans that vulcans arent very interested in comets
actually its your interest in the comet that were investigating
we plan to send a drilling team to the surface to collect core samples youre welcome to participate
if you have no objection wed like to remain here and observe
stay as long as you want
tpol
id love to know what theyre really doing here you dont find anything strange about them suddenly showing up
perhaps theyre simply curious
curious that doesnt sound very vulcan to me this isnt the first time weve caught them lurking around remember three weeks ago the planetary nebula
that was nothing more than a survey ship
so why didnt they respond to our hails whyd they go to warp when we headed toward them im starting to get the feeling theyre looking over our shoulder a little too often
that seems unlikely
well see fine if vanik is the kind of guy who likes to watch let him
ive never stood on a comet before
has anyone
good question
ive only seen snow twice in my life
well then its only fitting that we commemorate the occasion
you mean plant a flag
no too predictable
snowball fight
the ev suits would take all the fun out of that well just have to see how the spirit moves us when we get there
commander you wanted to see me
take a look at something will you ive been running diagnostics and i found some kind of power surge in the transceiver array
looks like an encrypted transmission it came from the vulcan ship
who was it sent to
youre sure this was sent to her quarters
i wish i wasnt did she say anything to you about it
not a word we had an agreement she promised not to speak to the vulcans without telling me
looks like shes having some trouble keeping her promises should i have hoshi decrypt it
tell her its top priority
whenever youre ready captain
you sure you want me here for this ive got a lot of work to do
stay put commander this is important start the recording to the students of miz malvins fourth grade class at the worley elementary school in kenmare county kerry ireland this is captain archer aboard the starship enterprise on behalf of the entire crew id like to thank you for your transmission we all got a real kick out of your drawings and letters you asked a lot of interesting questions i wish we had time to answer all of them but if we did that we wouldnt get much exploring done so ive selected a few and hopefully our answers will give you a better idea of what life is like out here liam brennan asks what do you eat for the most part the same things you eat at home our chef can make anything from a peanut butter and jelly sandwich to turkey with all the trimmings we have a hydroponic greenhouse onboard where we grow fruits and vegetables and we can also replicate certain foods with our protein resequencer heres one from geoff miles is dating allowed on enterprise well its not discouraged but there isnt a lot of privacy on a starship most of our crew share quarters with at least one other person so it wouldnt exactly be practical but if two crewmembers decide that they really like each other there are a lot of places they can go to look at the stars chloe oshannon wants to know how do we talk to aliens i think ill give that one to my communications officer ensign hoshi sato
well chloe thats a very good question we use a device called the universal translator its like an alien dictionary with hundreds of languages programmed into it and it can learn new languages very quickly but it doesnt always work and when that happens its up to me to try to translate im sure i dont have to tell you it can be really hard sometimes one wrong word can mean the difference between saying take my hand or take my life so far i have managed to do pretty well
thanks hoshi heres one from molly mccook when you flush the toilet where does it go that sounds like an engineering question so well ask commander charles tucker our chief engineer trip
pause it will you
a poop question sir cant i talk about the warp reactor or the transporter
its a perfectly valid question
the first thing youve got to understand is we recycle pretty much everything on a starship that includes waste and the first thing that happens to the waste is it gets processed through a machine called a biomatter resequencer then it gets broken down into hold on
theyre going to think im the sanitation engineer
youre doing fine
so the waste is broken down into little molecules and then they get transformed into any number of things we can use on the ship cargo containers insulation boots you name it
very enlightening commander gabrielle witty wants to know if germs can live in space
ah i believe i can answer that captain hello children im doctor phlox the ships physician im from a system called denobula triaxa and i feel very honoured to be part of this important mission germs they may be tiny but they are among the most resilient organisms known to medical science they can survive almost anywhere on your kitchen counter under your fingernail in the vacuum of space over two hundred million spacedwelling microbes have been catalogued one of the most virulent species lives inside grains of interstellar dust polycocyx astris they can drift in a dormant state for millions of years and still cause a nasty cold i once discovered a peculiar colony of spores on the hull of a
thank you doctor fascinating i think weve taken up enough of miz malvins classroom time by the way weve included some pictures of a comet were studying we think it might be the biggest one ever discovered by humans or vulcans thats whats so exciting about being on enterprise you never know what youre going to find next we miss earth but hearing from you makes us all feel a little closer to home captain archer out
howd it go
the beauty of ice is that it records everything like a blank page the farther down you drill the farther back in time you go
lieutenant
yes
what do you think
hand me the plasma torch
archer to lieutenant reed
go ahead sir
how are you doing malcolm
were just about to set the charges
im sure i dont need to remind you were being observed
no sir
we want this to go as smoothly as possible
make a good impression
right
so tell me
whos the sculptor
it wont be there for long sir
archer out
any luck
sorry it took so long the code was pretty complex
whats it say
its in vulcan youll have to run it through the translation matrix
you didnt read it
i didnt feel itd be right
thanks
come in
well we decrypted the message
and
its not exactly what we expected its a letter
what did it say
its personal
what do you mean
very personal you could order me to tell you sir but you wouldnt be happy if i did
why the hell was it encrypted
thats what i want to know maybe vulcans encrypt all their personal letters all they had to do was send it through regular channels mark it personal and wed have left it alone but no they had to encrypt it force me to start snooping i feel like i got caught with my hand in the cookie jar
let it go trip come on it was an honest mistake
i cant let it go ive got to tell her
hows that going to help
its the right thing to do at least ill be able to look her in the eye without feeling guilty
youre a good man you might want to take a phase pistol with you
i might need one
got a minute in private
excuse us crewman
did you ever did you ever do anything totally by mistake that you werent very proud of
no
did you ever come across something that you thought was one thing so you reacted in a certain way but then it turned out to be something completely different
your point commander
i found out about your message from the vulcan ship
it was a personal matter
why wasnt it sent through normal starfleet channels
that takes time the letter was important
so they sent it in code do you have any idea how suspicious that looked
you read my letter
believe me i dont feel very good about it
i have more letters in my quarters would you like to read those as well
im trying to apologise here
archer to tpol
yes captain
please report to my ready room
has anyone else read the letter
no
id appreciate it if you wouldnt mention it
i wont i promise
i thought id invite captain vanik for a visit if hes so interested in how we do things he might as well come see for himself once he realises were not going to blow up the galaxy maybe hell leave us alone
im sure hell appreciate the gesture
dinners a good way to break the ice i was hoping you might give chef some menu suggestions
certainly
a little food a little wine
vulcans dont drink wine
you know what i mean just help me make him go away
when did these symptoms begin
two days ago
perhaps you slept in an awkward position
i havent slept
for two days something on your mind it appears to be a tension headache you know anything said between us is strictly confidential would you like to talk about whats troubling you
no
i dont know if theres anyone on this ship you would feel comfortable talking with but if there is it might feel good to get whatevers bothering you out in the open  this is a simple analgesic i can give you something later to help you sleep this evening if youd like
thank you doctor
the ears are a nice touch
i thought so
we should get out more often
dont get too comfortable this landscape is about to change reed to enterprise
go ahead
charges are set
stand by inform the vulcans were about to make a very loud noise
aye sir
archer to reed
yes captain
blast away
understood
impressive
i was hoping for a little more symmetry
ill get the drill
if im not mistaken youre flying a surak class ship
youre not mistaken
you can get her up to what six six point five
six point five
id love to get a look inside those nacelles
our warp systems are classified
a few years back i was a guest aboard a maymora class ship the yarahla captain tok do you know him
not personally
oh we made a run to a dark matter nebula i helped set up the graviton telescope most fun ive ever had on a space walk those vulcan ev suits are something else like youre flying around inside your own little starship
youre easily impressed
something wrong with your pok tar
no
if its not to your liking im sure our chef can prepare you something else
ive already eaten
hope you saved room for dessert
after dinner i thought you might like to take a look around enterprise may not be surak class but shes quite a ship
perhaps another time
tea
i only drink water
you know for people who claim not to be explorers you sure do get around
i hope our presence here is not proving inconvenient
on the contrary its nice to know no matter how big the universe is theres always a vulcan ship nearby
so captain tell us about yourself
excuse me
on earth its customary to exchange personal information with someone youve just met
we have this peculiar habit of actually talking during meals
ive noticed what would you like to know
i dont know where were you born how long have you been captain any hobbies
ive served in the vulcan space programme for seventy six years fifteen of them commanding the timur
i believe this is captain vaniks first visit aboard an earth vessel
wed be happy to answer any questions you might have
i have none humans have never held much interest for me
well where did the time go seems like you just got here im sure youre eager to get back to your ship so ill trouble you with just one last question  how long to you plan on spying on us
if we were spying captain you would have never detected our presence your inexperience and your arrogance are your enemies not us
please show captain vanik to the launch bay
shanshot tumora camosh
whatd he say
captain you should take a look at this
archer to lieutenant reed
go ahead sir
hows it going
we hit a layer of magnesite and cracked a drill bit but weve replaced it
you may want to pick up the pace a little bit
sir
the comets rotational axis shifted when you set off those charges in about two hours the shuttlepod will be facing the star
the temperatures going to shoot up by a couple of hundred degrees i want you out of there before then
well be done with time to spare sir
be sure you are archer out
come in
you decide to tell me what vanik said
please sit down
ive never seen your quarters before cozy
you know youre not supposed to have an open flame on the ship
i was given permission from the captain theyre for meditation
so what can i do for you
doctor phlox believes that it might help if i was to discuss my problem with someone i felt comfortable confiding in
you want to talk to me well im not sure im going to be much help i mean ive only been in three relationships and they all went bust are you sure you wouldnt rather talk to hoshi or ensign kimball shes married
you were far from my first choice but speaking with someone else would mean more people knowing about my situation
ill do anything i can whats your problem
you read the letter
yes
then you know that unless i leave enterprise immediately my wedding plans will be cancelled
have you talked to
koss
have you talked to koss about all this
we havent spoken in many years marriages on vulcan are arranged during childhood ive only met koss four times
how can you be in love with a guy youve only met four times
its assumed that wed eventually develop an affection for one another
so his parents send you an ultimatum he doesnt have a say
his parents planned the union its their decision
boy where i come from arranged marriages went out with slavery
are you going to give me advice or criticize my peoples tradition
im still a little fuzzy on why they threatened to call it off in the first place
the ceremony was supposed to take place next week when i decided to remain on enterprise i requested a postponement kosss parents were insulted that i would put off our plans to serve on a human vessel
well vanik can take you home why dont you go marry koss then come back
its customary for a husband and wife to reside together for at least one vulcan year
maybe he can come to enterprise
hes an architect it would be illogical for him to live aboard a starship
this whole thing sounds illogical
your advice commander
what do you want to do
that is irrelevant
no its not its very relevant do you want to go back and marry this guy spend a year with him ten years a hundred years or do you want to stay on enterprise
i have an obligation
youve got an obligation to yourself youve spent the last year around humans if theres one thing you should have learned its that were free to make our own decisions theres a lot to be said for personal choice
if youd spent the last year on vulcan you would have learned that our commitment to tradition outweighs personal choice
i respect your customs but this marriage was arranged when you were a kid a lots happened since then people change
vulcans dont
really
my obligation is to my culture my heritage it has to take precedence
sounds to me like you already made up your mind why the hell did you ask me here
it was a mistake i apologise
did it ever occur to you that you might have postponed the wedding because subconsciously you wanted to get out of it
that would imply that my subconscious mind controls my decisions it doesnt
well it happens to humans all the time maybe youre picking up some of our bad habits
travis
im okay ah
what
my knee
you rest here
im all right
okay
well lets get you to the pod ill come back for the gear if theres time
at least take the core sample we shouldnt go back to the ship emptyhanded
almost there
it might be faster without the suits
yes and a lot colder
whats that
i hope i never see snow again
you all right
we should have never ignited the thrusters
well its not like we had a choice
you two okay
more or less how far did we drop
about eighteen metres well get you out of there
just give us a few minutes
were not going anywhere
bring the grappler online
the mouth of that chasms a little narrow
ill get you in close enough
do you see them
bring us in another fifty metres two metres starboard a little more
the vulcan ships hailing us
take a message im busy
captain vanik wants to know if we require assistance
tell him weve got everything under control
there right there synchronise to the rotation almost got it
one hit one miss
onell be fine reel them in
the pods hit an outcropping its wedged in take us a few metres to port we might be able to pull them around it those eisilium deposits are disrupting the maglock im losing them
ease them back down
theyve fallen another nine metres
lets try it again
captain theyre moving out of the sunlight the surface ice is recrystallising
in less than an hour that chasm will be sealed up again
then wed better hurry
there is another option captain vanik
id rather leave him out of this
his ship has a tractor beam that wont be affected by the eisilium
reset the grappler
vanik offered to assist us theres no shame in accepting
we can do this on our own
i dont like him any more than you do captain but a tractor beam sounds like a pretty good idea right now
vanik expects you to refuse his offer he sees humans as arrogant prideful why not prove him wrong you can save them or you can let your pride stand in the way youre human youre free to choose
theyve got us
go ahead enterprise
this is captain vanik of the vulcan ship timur stand by to ignite your engines and return to your ship
i thought you might want to take a look at the data we collected you helped us bring it back its the least we can do
as your science officer told you we have little interest in comets
that tractor beam of yours is quite something any chance we could take a look at the specifications
that information is classified
i thought it might be
well be leaving within the hour is there anything else we can help you with
youve done more than enough see you around
you dont have much time i assume youre all packed
captain with your permission id like to transmit a message to the timur to send to vulcan
go right ahead
thank you
what was that all about
its personal
morning everyone
morning sir
what have we got today
weve detected several phenomenon a jral class supernova remnant approximately three light years off our course
thats interesting what else
a cluster of three neutron stars very unusual
how about that three stonecold stars pretty exciting huh
anything else
there is one other thing that might be worth swinging by to take a look a minshara class planet about four and a half light years away
any life signs
only about five hundred million if our scans are right it looks like theres a whole civilisation down there
you might have put that on the top of the list
put us into orbit at five hundred kilometres
im not picking up any other ships or satellites
should we hail them
who im picking up dozens of cities on each continent
lets hold off a second we dont know whether theyre using highband frequencies or smoke signals
the latters more likely im not detecting any em transmissions
preindustrial
lets take a closer look
do you see that just off the coast
ive got it
looks like an old clipper ship
its almost like travelling back in time
i cannot wait to get down there
id advise against that its standard protocol to wait until a society develops warp drive before initiating first contact
those are vulcan protocols not human
starfleet would be wise to adopt them theres no way to know how our arrival would affect the evolution of their society
so what are you suggesting we do
our sensors can gather a great deal of data from orbit
give me a tighter view of the city hoshi
can you get tight enough to see their faces
freeze that they dont look so different what do you think trip
i think youre right captain
youd be recognised immediately as outsiders
not if we look like them starfleet couldve sent a probe out here to make maps and take pictures but they didnt they sent us so we could explore with our own senses
you okay
the acoustic relay is picking up dozens of languages i could spend the next ten years studying this place
well lets hear some of it
itll take a while to work out a translation matrix for all of them well be able to narrow it down for you once we pick a landing site i did find the one word you might want to remember akaali its the name of their species
a farm
its remote and sparsely populated if youre exposed theres a reduced risk of cultural contamination
this must be why aliens are always landing in cornfields so who do we send first
it should stand up to scrutiny as long as you dont look too close here see for yourself
it itches
you mustnt touch it ensign the irritation will subside
are you sure im the right person for this
if the translator goes down youll be able to handle yourself better than any of us
the anterior crests arent quite symmetrical ill just add a little more definition to the right side
we dont need it to be too perfect
of course captain
tpol to archer
go ahead
please report to the bridge
is there a problem
im detecting neutrino emissions from a city on the eastern continent
whats causing it
possibly an antimatter reactor
these people dont even have indoor plumbing
maybe some of them are more advanced than others
or maybe were not the first visitors what about nonindigenous biosigns
im not reading any but at this range its hard to be certain
trip tpol lets head down to sickbay  let the quartermaster know well need three more sets of clothing
my feet would be a lot happier in my own boots
whats this
identification papers everyone in the city has to carry them
tpol
tpol
over here
ive got it too the reactors about eight metres under this building
looks like some kind of curio shop
i guess well have to wait until morning
there could be a lot more people around then it might be easier to get a look at this thing tonight
except were on the wrong side of this door
not for long
seventy eight light years to get here our first act is breaking and entering
maybe you dont have to mention this part in your log
trip
going as fast as i can
archer to tpol
go ahead captain
i think we found what were looking for
acknowledged well meet at your coordinates
back here
the neutrino emissions are off the meter its got to be through here
its some kind of magnetic barrier
can you disable it
ill try
who are you what did you do to that door
nothing honest
i want to know what youre doing here
you dont need to point that weapon at us were collectors were picking up an antique
a real collector wouldve waited until the shop was open youre not here to pick up any antiques ive been watching the shop for weeks i know all about your evening deliveries
deliveries
people are getting sick some are even dying because of whats going on in here did you know that move away from the door
was that necessary
she was armed
lets try not to shoot anyone else while were here okay
ill try
the reactor signatures coming from the other side of that door but its protected by some kind of energy field
we should go itll be dawn soon
what about her we cant just leave her here
hoshi
her names riann shes an apothecary
ill meet you back at the shuttle
what did you do to me
nothing you just collapsed
thats the second lie youve told me youre not very good at it why did you bring me back here did garos tell you to are you working for him
garos
you dont know who im talking about he owns the shop you broke into
im not working for anyone i just wanted to make sure you got home all right
wait if you dont work for him what were you doing in there
theres something strange going on in that shop i dont know what exactly but im trying to figure it out im an investigator from another city
which city who sent you
i cant tell you anymore than that not right now
i suppose telling me nothing is better than another lie
my colleagues waiting for me ive got to go you said something about a sickness i wanted to come back tomorrow and talk to you about it will you be here
you didnt tell me your name
jon
jon how far away is this city
even if we flatten the building with a torpedo barrage it probably wouldnt make a dent in that energy field
what about the shop itself can you scan underneath it
thats strange sensors arent
picking up anything under the shop no basement no bedrock its like the buildings sitting on nothing at all
there must be some kind of dampening field in place
keep you sensors locked on that shop if you notice anything else out of the ordinary let me know right away
understood
that woman riann said something about people getting sick
i think we may have seen some of them mottled skin lesions on their faces
if we can get one of these people to the ship doctor phlox might be able to tell us whats wrong with them
id advise against that if im not mistake the fear of alien abduction caused a great deal of apprehension on your planet for centuries perhaps we should talk to the shopkeeper first
welcome gentlemen if i dont have what youre looking for im certain i can find someone who does can i help you
we noticed antiques in the window my friend here is an amateur collector
were you looking for something in particular
these are interesting
you wont find a more varied collection in the entire city this is the pride of my entire collection
whos it supposed to be
draylan the mythical ruler of the afterworld
youre not from this province are you
no and neither are you your dna doesnt match any other lifeform on this planet
nor does yours i see why you have a fondness for masks who are you
im captain jonathan archer of the starship enterprise were explorers from the planet earth
earth i never heard of it how did you know i was here
we picked up the signature from your reactor
now that you know who we are maybe you could tell us what youre doing here
im an explorer as well at least i used to be im from the malurian system two years ago i led a survey mission to study the akaali we had no plans to remain here but after a few months i found myself quite taken with these people so i decided to stay
if you enjoy the simple life so much why do you have an antimatter reactor in your basement
theres nothing nefarious about it i assure you the reactor powers a fabrication device it allows me to make food and clothing
i dont know if youve heard but theres an illness spreading through this area some people seem to think youre the cause of it
i see youve met our apothecary
you know her
shes been making baseless accusations against me for months theres a lethal virus spreading among the akaali but its indigenous i certainly didnt bring it here unfortunately these people dont have the medical technology to cure it so this woman blames the newcomer me
if you wouldnt mind wed like to take a look at this reactor of yours
perhaps some other time captain excuse me welcome if i dont have what youre looking for im certain i can find someone who does gentlemen
his reactors got an awful lot of power for a fabrication device
he could probably feed and clothe half the continent with it
archer to tpol
go ahead
how soon can you meet us
yes
hello again
hello whos your friend
her names tpol shes helping me investigate gaross shop you two have something in common tpol is a scientist as well
your facilitys impressive would you mind
if youre careful not to touch anything you two are from the same province
not exactly
must be difficult to make friends when you keep so much to yourself
im sorry i dont mean to be evasive
yes you do
turn down that flame please
i was hoping you could tell us a little bit more about this illness
why dont you tell me why you were in gaross shop
we were trying to get into the basement we think theres some kind of machine there something hes not supposed to have
what kind of machine
were not sure but it may be indirectly connected to this epidemic if you can tell us what you know we might be able to help
i cant tell you much people are dying and i cant determine why drop this in the water carefully i learned of the epidemic about eighteen months ago my brother was one of the first victims
im sorry
at first i thought it was some kind of airborne contagion but it never spread beyond this part of the city im sampled the soil the water i cant find anything out of the ordinary
why do you believe this garos is involved
the first cases occurred here
a few hundred metres from his shop that was just one month after he arrived
you said something about evening deliveries
every few nights someone carries crates from his shop to different places outside the city when ive gone back in the morning crates are gone hand me that
thats why you were watching his shop you thought we were there for the crates
tea would you like some
jon may i speak with you
id love a cup
did you get what you need
i should return to the ship and begin my analysis
all right you and the others head back
what about you
ill stay here see if i can earn more about garos and these shipments
the longer you remain the more you risk cultural contamination
these people are suffering from something a lot worse than cultural contamination weve got to find out what it is
enjoy your tea
quite impressive did you say this is a preindustrial society
yes
her methods may be unrefined but this woman is using forensic techniques far more sophisticated than i wouldve expected isnt it extraordinary thousands of sentient species in our little corner of the cosmos each one discovering science in their own unique way
had this woman been born on vulcan or earth im sure she would have made a fine physician heres our culprit the water samples contaminated with tetracyanate 622
im not familiar with it
its a synthetic compound primarily used as an industrial lubricant usually under the strictest safety protocols its quite toxic
could this be responsible for the epidemic
if its managed to seep into the ground water absolutely
ill notify the captain
samples from three new subjects indicate no
did you say something
sorry i mutter when im writing sometimes its an old habit
i have a similar one i talk to my dog
my mother bought me a tousorobco once but it tuployo pludak
what was that
are you all right
all right im all right
someone was walking this way but he turned and went around the corner i thought if we pretended to be
i understand
i want you to head back
not before i see whats in those crates help me open this
move
have you ever seen anything like that
actually i have
stay here
jon
its all right hes not dead
is there anything else youd like to tell me jon
if your ship can travel to so many stars then why would you come here
to meet you
me
not you personally but your people
why were so backward compared to you
if you take away our technology were not that different
come on
theyre mining some kind of veridium isotope
veridium is primarily used to manufacture explosives
im not surprised
did you find any traces of tetracyanate
their drill bits are saturated with it weve got to shut this all down the reactor seems to be powering the entire operation but i cant use my phasepistol id risk blowing up half the city
captain let me come down there and take a crack at it
i doubt that we have that much time our best shot is the transporter ill see what i can do about disengaging that dampening field give me a few minutes
understood
i dont suppose you read malurian
cant you use your device
it wasnt designed for that
what are we looking for
theres an energy field surrounding the shop its keeping my ship from seeing whats in here one of these controls should turn it off
here this is tengala street heres the shop this outline could have something to do with the energy field wait what are you doing
if the blue line represents the dampening field this blue button should control it
what about the yellow dots
what about them
how do we know they dont represent the field maybe its the yellow button
the blue ones lit
thats what worries me
we could debate this all day blue or yellow
blue
theres a ship approaching
from where
it must have been in a geosynchonous orbit on the other side of the planet
im picking up multiple weapon platforms theyre armed to the teeth
were being hailed from the surface
the captain
i dont think so
on screen
i suggest you leave this system at once or my ship will open fire
i want to speak with captain archer
that wont be possible hes dead
the ships firing
my vessel is capable of firing ten of those charges simultaneously again i suggest you break orbit
how did you learn about this facility captain was it from a somewhat ugly tellarite merchant perhaps
i told you we detected your reactor from orbit
i forgot youre explorers
were trying to help these people what youre doing here is contaminating their water supply
there are five hundred million akaali on this planet a few thousand wont be missed im willing to let you go provided you promise not to return weve instructed your ship to send down a launch vehicle to take you and the woman
she belongs here
believe me shell be better off on your ship now step away from the control panel captain
if anyone walks through either of these doors aim this and pull the trigger
theyre recharging weapons
prepare to leave orbit on my order
belay that keep this ship right where it is
i dont have to reiterate that i outrank you mister tucker ensign
engineering
billy stand by to vent the nacelles on my order
yes sir
were not going anywhere
i didnt say leave orbit i said prepare to leave orbit i have no intention of abandoning the captain dead or alive
the dampening fields down
anything
ive got a fix on it
transfer the coordinates
the forward hull platings depolarising
evasive manoeuvres keep us within transporter range
ill try
return fire
theyve got some kind of energy shielding our weapons are ineffective
its the captain
put him through
hows it going up there
a malurian vessels opened fire were taking damage
and the reactor
were trying to get a lock on it now
are you all right he said youd been killed
dont worry about me just get the reactor
jon
weve lost lateral thrusters
commander tucker status
thisd be a lot easier if youd stop rocking the boat
how long
ive almost got a lock
i cant shake them
even if we get the reactor how are we going to keep them from taking it back
if they want it so badly maybe we should give it to them
ive got a lock
starboard tubes loaded
stand by to go to full impulse now commander
fire
their shielding is down
come about ensign target their weapons array
the oil lamp
what about it
there should be at least a litre of residic oil in the container below it residic oil ignites at three hundred and ninety eight degrees you wouldnt happen to have anything that gets that hot
archer
the reactors been destroyed captain weve disarmed the malurian ship should we disable their engines
no theyre about to leave but first they need to pick up three passengers archer out i dont think youre going to have time to pack up your shop
tell them to take the entire dose
just one
thats all theyll need
what if garos comes back
ive notified tpols people theyre going to look in on you from time to time
they could stop by for tea
you bet its probably best if you keep all this to yourself
whod believe me anyway where is your starship headed now
there are lots of inhabited planets to see but i doubt many will be this memorable
is your translator broken again
im sorry i dont understand a word youre saying
hauled down in the corner of the end zone touchdown
like to see you make that catch with the gravity plating at earth sea level
i doubt you could throw the ball ten metres on earth
one more reason not to go
did you find out what was causing that vibration in module two
the cargo handlers at jupiter station they didnt balance the load shaw and i we er we trimmed it out
keep an eye on it
bridge to captain keene were under attack sir its the nausicaans
drop out of warp charge the plasma cannon
archer
sorry to disturb you sir but i have an incoming transmission from starfleet command its admiral forrest
put him through
yes sir
admiral good to see you
you too jon what i can make out
were getting ready to deploy the first subspace amplifier should clear up reception a bit
whatever you have to do to keep those reports coming the scans of that comet were incredible
something tells me you didnt call at four in the morning to talk about comets
i hate to do this to you jon but were turning you around
sir
we picked up an automated distress signal from a cargo freighter the ecs fortunate the nearest starfleet vessel is three weeks away at its maximum warp but you could be there in a day and a half
whats the problem
were not sure theyre not responding to hails id like you to check this out give them any assistance they need
were on our way
forrest out
i think our days going to start a little early
the earth cargo ship fortunate yclass freighter maximum speed warp one point eight crew complement twenty three
not counting newborn babies
ensign
i grew up on a jclass a little smaller but the same basic design and one thing i can tell you is that at warp one point eight youve got a lot of time on your hands between ports thats how my parents wound up with me
do you have any helpful information on this vessel beyond its recreational activities
for example what kind of weapons they carry
well typically nothing more than a lowyield plasma cannon but most freight haulers wouldve upgraded the first chance they got
why is that
think about it youre a dozen light years from home with twenty kilotons of dilithium ore in your hold armed with nothing but a popgun for shooting oncoming meteors what would you do
im reading hull damage their warp reactors offline and most of their primary systems are down
any other ships in the region
none captain
open a channel fortunate this is captain jonathan archer of the starship enterprise fortunate please respond
their comm systems may be down
im reading twenty four biosigns
have doctor phlox meet us in the launch bay
easy does it theres a lot of debris out here
aye sir
some of it doesnt appear to be from the fortunate
on the bright side im only picking up inorganic material no bodies
the main hatch is damaged no chance well get a positive seal
there should be an auxiliary hatch on the port side
permission to come aboard
granted im matthew ryan first officer
jonathan archer captain of the enterprise sorry we couldnt meet under better circumstances what happened here
nausicaans they tried to board us we managed to fight them off but not before we took a few bruises
nausicaans
pirates sir theyve been attacking freighters in this sector for years my parents had a runin with them once they were lucky to come out of it alive
your parents ran freight
still do an old jclass the horizon
ive got repair teams standing by what can we do
oh we can handle this ourselves captain but thank you
if you didnt need our help why did you send out a distress call
one of our younger crewmembers panicked hit the emergency beacon with our comm down we had no way to tell starfleet to ignore it
wheres your captain
he was wounded in the attack im in command until hes back on his feet im sorry we took valuable time away from your mission
mister ryan im a physician if your captain or anyone else is hurt it wouldnt be right for me to leave without seeing them
hes got a lot more experience than any freighter medic i know
weve come an awfully long way it would be a shame to turn around without lending a hand
is he going to die
not any time soon the nausicaan weapon disrupted his neural pathways ive started him on a cortical regeneration but itll take some time
how long
two days maybe three
since we have to stick around we might as well help you get your ship up and running
thats all right
i understand youre used to doing things on your own but were here use us we might be able to upgrade your hull plating your weapons couldnt hurt the next time you run into these nausicaans the sooner youre back at warp the sooner that cargo youre hauling gets to where its supposed to go
youre letting them send over more people
a few engineers thats all
we cant have people crawling all over the place
well keep them where theyre supposed to be
and what if they find him
what do you want me to do throw him off the ship
anything keep at it i want those codes
tripll get a kick out of this its older than he is the quartermaster wont have anything like it but engineering should be able to make one for you
weve got our own machine shop
im sure your guys have their hands full were happy to do it
thats a transporter
enterprise came with all the trimmings
ive read about them have you been through it
not yet most of the crew is afraid but im kind of curious to try it out
they say that for a split second you can actually feel yourself in both places at once
why do you think i want to try it
so you were on the horizon
i was born on her halfway between draylax and vega colony
how do your parents feel about you leaving
ive still got my sister and her husband aboard the horizon but i know my dad expected me to take over at some point
then whyd you leave
i had to figure out where i wanted to spend the rest of my life and i was pretty sure it wasnt on the draylax  vega run besides the horizon didnt have transporters to play with
these valve seals are shot well have to synthesise some new ones give me about forty minutes if you want our resident boomer here can give you a tour
thanks ive already seen most of the ship
you missed the best part the only warp five engine in the fleet
ive heard about it
once they get installed in the next generation of freighters itll change a whole lot of things
even with a warp three engine youd be able to cut a five year cargo run down to six months
warp one point eight works just fine for us any faster and thered be no time to enjoy the trip
save room for dessert home made icecream
you eat this well all the time
chefs the best in starfleet i heard the captain had to call in a lot of favours to get him on board its good you stayed away from the resequenced meat loaf they still havent gotten that right
resequenced this tastes real
thats because it is
you know the last time i had a steak eighteen months ago all weve got left now are hydroponics and nutripaks
i remember those what did we used to call them
mystery meals
my dad was a pretty good cook he could do magical things with those nutripaks
when it was someones birthday my mother would bake a cake we knew batter than to ask what it was made of
didnt stop you from eating it
oh no way
your parents on the fortunate
no they were on the north star
were you on board
yeah i was one of the survivors i went to the fortunate after that
im sorry
running freight is dangerous
you ever think about doing something else
you mean join starfleet
the foods not bad
was this premeditated buy me lunch and give me the recruiting pitch
no but youve spent more time in space than most starfleet captains there are three more nx class ships on the drawing boards theyre going to need experienced people
if starfleet gets all the good crews who does that leave to run the freighters
dont worry not everybodys going to go
you did
you think leaving the horizon was easy for me that i just took off because i got tired of the food that ship was my home
so whyd you leave it why did you abandon your family
being in starfleet is the best thing that ever happened to me my parents werent happy i left but they respected my decision
did they or were they just saying what you wanted to hear so you wouldnt feel guilty commander tucker should be done with my valve assembly by now thanks for lunch
come on
why is power being rerouted from internal sensors to the weapons systems
maybe you didnt notice we were in a battle
the battle is over ill remove the bypass
thats all right you can just leave them
ready or not here i come have you seen nadine
no
have you seen nadine
im sorry i dont know which child is named nadine
thanks
i just told him the truth
tpol to archer
go ahead
the repairs are almost finished captain
acknowledged
but there is something i need to speak to you about in private
those engine parts mister tucker gave you working out okay
some of the connections were off by a few microns but they should be fine
good doctor phlox tells me captain keenes condition is improving
well hes still unconscious but the burns are healing thanks to your doctor
anything else we can do
thanks but were anxious to get underway goodbye captain
theres one other question id like to ask you are there only humans on board your ship
i think one of the kids has a teneebian skunk as a pet if thats what you mean
it isnt
tpols scanner picked up a nausicaan biosign
are you saying weve got a stowaway
you know thats not what were saying why dont you tell us whats going on over there
well what are you talking about
my bioscans indicated this nausicaan was injured
okay not that its any of your business but there is a nausicaan aboard hes my prisoner
what gives you the right to take prisoners
they have been attacking our ship for months stealing our cargo they nearly killed my captain now what gives them the right to do that
i want to see him
and what would you do take him back to nausicaa theyd probably give him a medal
what do you plan to do with him
that is my business starfleet doesnt have any jurisdiction over what goes on aboard my ship
youre right but there is one thing i do have jurisdiction over archer to tucker
go ahead captain
i want you to remove all the spare parts and equipment you installed on the fortunate
sir
you heard me trip
you wouldnt do that
watch me
hes in there
where
hes tied up over there
im reading one biosign but its not nausicaan
dont do this
get down
under the circumstances i defer to your experience
ryan youre making a big mistake  go
captain theres a breach
ryan
what was that
what the hells going on over there
there are four biosigns on the module its the away team
tucker to captain archer
are you all right
were fine i dont want the fortunate leaving
understood hail them
no response
theyre charging weapons
polarise the hull plating
the fortunate has fired its weapons
trip report
theyre getting a little triggerhappy sir stand by load starboard tubes three and four target their engines
aye sir
theyre jettisoning our pod their warp drives coming online
fire
enterprise to archer
howre you doing trip
were okay sir we didnt take too much damage but the fortunate just went to warp
follow them
captain considering our rate of decompression id suggest enterprise retrieve us as quickly as possible
belay that trip send a shuttlepod over here to pick us up weve sprung a leak
on our way
were trying to track their warp trail but their plasma cannon knocked out our long range sensors
how long till theyre back online
mister tucker says at least four hours
we dont know where they are but we know who theyre looking for the nausicaans ryans after revenge sir
a very primitive emotion but it would explain his irrational behaviour
its rational to him those pirates attacked his ship thats his family if we want to find the fortunate we need to find the nausicaans
the frequencies
youre not very skilled at interrogation i could give you some lessons
give me the frequencies
you know my shipmates will come for me
im counting on it
that wasnt so difficult was it
you nearly killed him
remodulate the weapons
what about the nausicaan
keep him locked up we might still need him
weve got what we wanted lets just get him off the ship
how
an escape pod
so his friends can pick him up and he can tell them to change their shield modulations what was the point of all this
ive been asking myself the same question weve always dealt with the nausicaans without taking hostages or beating information out of them
if we dont show them that were serious theyre never going to leave us alone
how would the captain want us to handle this
im responsible for this ship now and i need to know that you are going to help me do whatever it takes to protect her
weve taken enough casualties its time we started inflicting some of our own
anything
no try bypassing circuit l47
aye sir
i dont know whats going on with that guy i can understand taking on those pirates i probably would have done the same thing but firing on a starfleet vessel hes got a lot more than pirates to worry about now
never thought id see a yclass running from any ship i was on when i was growing up on the horizon anything that happened on board you handles yourself if someone on the crew got into a fight you just worked it out you took care of your own if starfleet suddenly showed up and told my father what he could and couldnt do on his own ship
things are changing ryans going to have to figure that out
maybe he already has and he just doesnt like it
got it sensors are back online
come in
do you have a minute sir
i think i can squeeze you in
whats on your mind travis
permission to speak freely sir
any time
im worried that were not handling the situation the right way
go on
you know id never question your orders
you served on one of those freighters i want to hear your opinion
maybe ryans right maybe this isnt any of our business if he doesnt want our help why force it on him
so you think we should just let ryan take on the nausicaans
dont underestimate a freighter crew sir my father never ran into any trouble he couldnt handle himself nausicaans included
so what happens to the nausicaans
sir
suppose ryan finds the ship that attacked him maybe its been damaged and the fortunate is more than a match for them what do you think ryanll do
hed probably try to blow them out of the sky
i dont know about you travis but that doesnt sit right with me human beings have a code of behaviour that applies whether theyre starfleet officers or space boomers and it isnt driven by revenge just because someone isnt born on earth doesnt make him any less human
youre right sir i suppose i should understand that more than anyone
any other orders of mine youd like to question
not today sir thank you sir
are you sure
ive seen that hull signature enough times
the new shield frequencies
loaded and standing by
bring the cannons online drop out of warp
theyre just sitting there a hundred kilometres ahead near a small asteroid
put it on the viewer
theyve seen us lay in an intercept course full impulse
were closing twenty kilometres theyre firing the hull plating is holding
can you get a weapons lock
were out of range
then get us into range
ten kilometres nine cannons locked on target
return fire
theyve gone behind the asteroid ive lost the lock
this must be where they offload stolen cargo
im getting us out of here
hold your course
ryan
we still have their shield frequencies lock weapons on the first ship and fire
again
no effect
are you sure you programmed the right frequencies
i used the ones he gave us
go to warp
the reactor is offline
full impulse then hull plating to maximum
weve lost impulse theyre hailing us
our scans show you have one of our crewmen aboard i assume youre here to return him
hes our prisoner
he wont be for long
theyve latched onto us
captain long range sensors are detecting weapons fire
whos doing the shooting
its difficult to be sure at this distance sir looks like some kind of plasma discharge i cant rule out our boomer friends
lay in a course
aye sir
theyre in the access corridor section d
how many
three
pass out weapons
we know what theyre after why not just let them have himgt
we fought them off before we can do it again
it was one ship not three
weapons
we should pull back
its the fortunate sir and three smaller ships
nausicaans
polarise the hull plating drop us out of warp are we in range
two hundred thousand kilometres ahead
put it up
there are four nausicaan biosigns on board the fortunate and im detecting weapon discharges
hail the nausicaans
which ship sir
lets see who answers
wed better get him to the infirmary
hes going to be okay
i told you theyd come for me
shut up
were involved in a rescue operation
theres a lot of firing going on for a rescue
we want our crewman back
he wouldnt be there if you hadnt attacked them in the first place
perhaps we have an opportunity here to improve relations between your people and mine
were happy with our relations the way they are
i have a proposal for you well get your man back and then youll let the fortunate continue on her way
youre facing three of my ships we are not interested in your proposals
weve scanned your ships mister reed
fore and aft plasma cannons i doubt those shields of theirs would hold up to our torpedoes
youre not sneaking up on an old freighter this time this is an nx class starship take a good look because youll be seeing more of them now you can reconsider my offer or you can take your chances
if you think you can convince them to return our crewman do it quickly otherwise well be forced to take our chances
enterprise to ryan this is jonathan archer were ten thousand metres off your starboard bow i know you can hear me why dont you think about whats best for your crew and let us help you
what a relief starfleets come to save the day
ive spoken
to the nausicaan captain hes willing to let the fortunate go if you turn over his crewman
what and you believe him you believe theyre just going to let us fly away
ive got an armoury of torpedoes that will make sure they do
what about next time when another freighter gets jumped
in the middle of nowhere what then
youve got a chance to stop this before anyone else gets hurt
im dealing with them the only way they understand
one of the nausicaan ships has locked weapons on us sir
this has gone on long enough now youre putting my crew in danger release that hostage
hes my prisoner and im going to handle
this in my way
what are you going to do kill him
oh you again
sir with your permission you think killing one of them is going to accomplish anything
what your captain decide a little boomer to boomer talk would persuade me
just shut up and listen to me i dont give a damn about you any more
im just thinking about my family
what have they got to do with this
whats going to happen to the next freighter that runs into the nausicaans what if its the horizon and they have to pay the price for your
stubborn stupidity
im doing this for them
the hell you are this isnt about protecting cargo ships
that is just what its about
dont kid yourself into thinking youre doing this for some greater good this is about revenge nothing else
the nausicaan ships are firing sir
return fire starboard tubes three and four
you dont like me because i left the horizon to join starfleet youre afraid that if more people do that there wont be anyone left to run the freighters maybe youre right
maybe not but if you dont let your hostage go
the nausicaans are going to kill you and your crew
port tubes one and two fire
and then therell be twenty three fewer people out there to run those freighters
no maybes
hold your fire take him
the nausicaans are powering down their weapons theyre moving off sir
need a hand
just a little stiff thank your doctor for me ive got some drilaxian whisky stashed away if youd like to join me
im on duty
too bad if youve never had it youre missing one of the galaxys real pleasures im reducing mister ryans rank to able crewman he gets to spend the rest of the trip purging hydraulic pumps
if you think hes going to be a problem we could take him back to earth
no we take care of our own besides that would leave me a man short
understood
i made him my first officer because i trusted him with my ship its going to take him quite a while to earn that back
his intentions were good but someone should teach him to accept help when its offered
the ones that grew up out here feel they have some special claim that this particular stretch of space is theirs they see another ship within ten light years they get jumpy
theyre going to be seeing a lot more ships than theyre used to
the ships get faster its progress i suppose my familys been on the fortunate for three generations now im going to need at least a warp three engine to stay in business
maybe thats not so bad at warp three helps a lot closer than before you wont have to go it alone
going it alones all ive ever done and for some of us its the reason were out here a chance to prove ourselves
i think youve already done that
well well adapt we always have but things just wont be the same
good luck
sure you wont join me for that drink
thanks but my crews anxious to get underway next time
this wasnt part of our agreement
you failed in your last mission the klingon empire is intact you knew there would be consequences
please i wont disappoint you again
well restore it but only if you succeed in your next mission
but youre disabling me
you wont need enhanced vision where youre going proceed with the extraction
hold the door where were you last night
i decided to turn in early
well you didnt miss much
whatd they show
night of the killer androids
that bad
weve got fifty thousand movies in the database there must be something worth watching
you could always read a book
lieutenant
ensigns enjoy the show last night those were two hours of my life id rather have back
good morning sir
morning daniels i thought this was taylors shift
i switched with him if thats all right with you
no problem
sir i noticed we changed course may i ask why
theres a stellar nursery not far from here we detected several ships inside we thought we might go say hello
very good sir more orange juice
no thanks im fine
what have you got
we found one of the ships sir
put it up
it appears to be a transport vessel
hail them
theyre responding
can i help you
my name is archer im captain of the starship enterprise were from earth we thought wed introduce ourselves
pleased to meet you what do you want
nothing were new to this region and were eager to make contact with other species
oh
if you dont mind my asking what brings you here
a job im escorting a group of spiritually minded men on a pilgrimage to the great plume of agosoria
the the what
every eleven years one of the protostars gives out a neutron blast these gentlemen believe its a sacred event if you ask me i think its just another ball of hydrogen
when is this great plume due to erupt
tomorrow
mind if we join you
its your time to waste
id like to extend an invitation to you and your passengers to visit enterprise
ill ask them if theyre interested i prefer to stay with my ship
understood mister
fraddock captain fraddock
looks like we could be having guests tell chef to prepare something
seals good
welcome aboard captain jonathan archer its customary on earth to greet someone with a handshake
im prah mantoos may agosoria embrace you into his cycle of renewal
thanks
these are my fellow celebrants weve travelled many light years from different worlds to watch this event
im commander tucker chief engineer and this is our science officer subcommander tpol
for you captain
its beautiful what exactly is it
a clock it charts time from the beginning of the universe
voosinteel
its a spirit traditionally consumed as the plume reaches its full brilliance youll find it enhances the experience
mmm im sure it does
youre very generous im afraid the only thing we have to offer you is our hospitality
that will be more than enough
our chef has prepared a meal in your honour
normally we fast during the time of agosoria but in this case i suppose we can break with tradition
please
four months three weeks and
six days
youve travelled a great distance in a short period of time
warp five will get you where youre going pretty fast
weve seen a lot since we left earth but i have to say that this place is definitely one of the highlights
im pleased you appreciate its beauty captain to us its more than just a simple stellar nursery according to our sacred text this is where the universe began
and the great plume of a ager
agosoria
agosoria how does that fit in
it represents the continuing cycle of creation
its not unlike the hindu faith commander they also believe that the universe goes through repeated cycles of rebirth
i didnt realise you were familiar with earth religions doctor
oh yes in fact while i was there i made it a point to study a number of them i spent two weeks at a tibetan monastery where i learned to sing chords with the high lamas i attended mass at saint peters square i was even allowed to observe the talshanar at the vulcan consulate
i understand vulcans are a deeply spiritual people
our beliefs are based on logic and the pursuit of clarity
do you follow a particular faith captain
i guess you could say i try to keep an open mind
many who see the great plume are often inspired by it perhaps you will be too
did you get to meet them
two briefly
what were they like
quiet theyre taking a tour of the ship
looks like the captains going all out
i hope hes not planning to show them the armory
dont worry lieutenant they didnt look like the types whod go around stealing military secrets
still were not familiar with these species tactical systems should be offlimits starboard targeting sensors out again
should i call engineering
no ill take care of it itll only take a moment you have the bridge ensign
arent you going to take the chair
what
youre in command
im fine right here
havent you ever wondered what its like
i can wait till im promoted
okay
nice fitbridge looks a lot different from here think anyone would mind if i fired a torpedo
permission to take my station
sorry sir
the gravimetric field displacement manifold commonly known as the warp reactor just think of it as a great big engine but instead of using electricity or chemical fuel it runs on antimatter see this swirling light when matter and antimatter collide it creates a whole lot of energy we channel that energy through those conduits over there they lead to the two large glowing cylinders you may have seen on the outside of the ship
the nacelles
thats right
which contain warp coils that create the subspace displacement field
i see you already know a thing or two about starship engines
im a warp field theorist
oh well i guess that covers the basics any questions
how do you regulate positron flow in your dilithium matrix
good one ill bring up the schematic of the reactor assembly and you can see for yourself if youll just come with me we use a series of magnetic constrictors to align the positron stream
if any stray particles escape backups automatically kick in during one of our training tests we momentarily lost the primaries and the backups
about a billion positrons cut through the plating on three decks nearly caused a hull breach we spent a month redesigning the system it hasnt given us a single problem since
were being hailed by captain fraddock
hes probably calling about the weather
on screen
you might want to focus your sensors on that plasma lightning up ahead
were aware of it
you ever been in a plasma storm
twice
then you know it can get a little bumpy i suggest we try and go around it
agreed ensign
im already on it
theres your heart lungs liver another heart every organ this imaging device also allows us to examine your genetic structure ah youll be happy to know youre in perfect health who would like to go next
excuse me archer to the bridge report
were circumnavigating a plasma storm captain
its just turbulence from the outer edge
theyre very common in this region im sure theres nothing to worry about
that one hit our port bow powers down on cdeck subsection four no other damage
ensign
the storms moving in our direction im having trouble getting around it
what about the transport ship
hes far enough ahead he made it past
weve got a power surge in the impulse relays heres a good example of how we can reroute the energy flow to protect our critical systems
im afraid we have to cut the tour a little short ill be on the bridge
report
were losing main power
trip
whats happening
that last bolt struck the warp manifold
weve got an antimatter cascade sir
if it reaches the warp reactor were going to  i think were all right captain the cascade stopped in its tracks
good work trip
it wasnt me sir
sorry about the bad weather
were used to it im just grateful there was no serious damage
if any of your group would like to watch the great plume from our mess hall theyre welcome to come back tomorrow
ill let them know
have a great time doctor
i plan to captain thank you for letting me spend the night with these people
ill expect a full report in the morning
aye captain
hope to see you tomorrow
tucker to captain archer
go ahead trip
can you come down to engineering for a minute
on my way
what is it trip
take a look at this
what
right up there see that conduit
yeah
its an antimatter junction it stopped the cascade from reaching the warp reactor
what are you getting at
somebody got in here and disconnected it from the primary antimatter feed if they hadnt that cascade would have continued right into the reactor core and this ship would have gone up just like the great plume of agosoria
one of your staff
i already asked nobody seems to know anything about it
sounds to me like youve got a hero whos a little reluctant about taking credit talk to them again whoever did this deserves a commendation
im telling you sir i dont think it was one of my people they would have said something
i spoke with every one of them
how about the warp theorist
him too none of them went anywhere near that conduit if i told you i did it would there be some kind of reward
thank you captain
maybe it was the cycle of renewal
if anyone comes forward youll let me know
oh youll be the first
sir i need to speak with you
why dont you talk to one of my bridge officers im a little busy right now
its important
im sorry daniels ive got my hands full
its about the suliban
what about them
ive reason to believe that one of the pilgrims who came aboard today is a suliban soldier his name is silik hes the man you fought with on the helix
how the hell do you know what i did on the helix
it might be best if we discussed this in private
my ready room
i think itd be better if we went to my quarters
what
youll understand when we get there sir
oh please have a seat im sorry about the mess sometimes i think my bunkmate majored in chaos theory
what is that that doesnt look like starfleet issue
thats because im not a member of starfleet not that i wouldnt be honoured to be one sir especially after spending time
who are you how do you know what happened on the helix
did silik tell you who he was working for
im the one asking questions crewman
did he mention the temporal cold war
what do you know about that
a great deal more than you do sir
if youre not a member of starfleet then who are you
i work for a different kind of organization we make sure that people like silik dont interfere with historical events
ive never heard of a group like that
thats because it doesnt exist yet
so youre telling me youre some kind of a time traveller
thats one way of putting it maybe thisll help clear things up
this is how we keep an eye on whats going on you might call it a temporal observatory i know this must seem a little overwhelming
overwhelming doesnt quite cover it
i come from right about right about here approximately nine hundred years from now
are you human
more or less
and the people giving silik orders
theyre from an earlier century from about here they cant manifest themselves physically in the past they can only partially materialise to deliver information
but not you
in the years that followed we eventually perfected the process
sounds dangerous
when time travel was first developed it wasnt long before people realised that laws had to be made all the species who had the technology agreed that it would only be used for research
but it wasnt thats what the temporal cold war is all about
look at this this is a group of anthropologists from 2769 observing the construction of the great pyramid at giza theyre doing it using the proper procedures set forth in the temporal accord but there are factions that ignore those procedures
why are you telling me all this
silik is the one who prevented the reactor breach
are you implying silik was sent here to save my ship and if he hadnt we would have been destroyed today
i am not implying anything all im saying is that i was assigned here to capture silik when he came aboard he is a threat and i need you to help me capture him
youre from nine hundred years in the future and you need my help
the suliban have been given genetic enhancements that allow them to evade most sensors theyre nearly impossible to detect
ive noticed
i have special equipment that can help track silik but itll be far more effective if i can tie it into your internal sensor grid ill need access to main engineering and your command codes but we have reason to believe that the twenty second century is a front in this cold war what happens here could affect millennia to come its imperative that we find out who silik is working for and what theyre trying to do
if i decide to help you i cant do it alone i need to inform some of my crew
the fewer the better youre asking me to capture someone who just saved my ship why should i trust you
you like your scrambled eggs soft have i ever brought them to you any other way
you sure you dont want a glass
im sure the vulcan science directorate has studied the question of time travel in great detail they found no evidence that it exists or that it can exist
the suliban woman i spoke with sarin she also used the phrase temporal cold war
thats what daniels called it
the same words
that proves nothing
what about the sulibans genetic engineering phlox says its far beyond their abilities
that doesnt mean that it was given to them by visitors from the future until daniels can offer you concrete proof id remain extremely skeptical
im telling you he pushed a button on this device and the whole room changed
on the xyrillian ship i was in a holographic chamber where i couldve sworn i was in a boat at sea if what daniels says is true then silik saved enterprise maybe we shouldnt look a gift horse in the mouth
if theres even a possibility that this cold war exists we cant ignore daniels request
bridge to captain archer
yes hoshi
were approaching the protostar sir
and the transport ship is requesting permission to dock some of the passengers would like to take you up on your offer and observe it from the mess hall
initiate docking procedures ill be right there one of them might be silik we dont have time to debate this any longer  i want you to help daniels
i always knew wed be meeting people from other planets but other centuries youre not buying any of this are you
if daniels could travel through time why not simply go back one more day into the past and prevent silik from boarding this ship in the first place
maybe thats plan b
or maybe hes really not from the future
then why make up such a crazy story
he could be trying to conceal his true intentions
i thought you scientists were supposed to keep an open mind
theres a difference between keeping an open mind and believing something because you want it to be true
what the hells that supposed to mean
roja durana tua teenan captain that is a traditional greeting on the morning of agosoria it means may the plume light your way
i take it you enjoyed your visit
oh it was mesmerising four hours of ritual prayer followed by the kaanasah a series of exercises designed to purify the body i think i strained a leg muscle but it was well worth it
how many decided to join us
eleven i believe the others wanted to observe the star from their ship
so that leaves six on the transport
i didnt take a head count but that sounds about right
did any of them seem out of place
how do you mean
did they all take part in the rituals
as far as i could tell but our eyes were closed most of the time is there something wrong captain
no just curious
you seem a little preoccupied
its been a long night glad you had a good time enjoy the view
i will
my equipment draws a lot of power ill need another twenty megawatts routed to your sensor grid
commander
the grid can handle it so i take it your brother isnt really an orbital engineer at jupiter station
actually i dont have a brother
and you didnt grow up in illinois
oh im from a place called illinois sir just not the one youre familiar with
its good to know earth will still be around in nine hundred years
that depends on how you define earth
beg your pardon
you might want to initialise the grid im ready to download the biometric parameters
right whats this
its very delicate please dont
please dont touch it
you know weve got a little pool going in engineering where we try to guess how far the ship will travel each day i dont suppose you could give me a tip on tomorrows distance
im afraid we dont monitor events quite that closely
one of the power relays is offline
must have been damaged during the plasma storm j37 its about three metres behind that bulkhead
ill take care of it
j37
try it now
i know i know your breakfast is two hours late dont give me that look if its any consolation i missed my breakfast too
whats the problem youre not getting any cheese
if youre thinking of calling for help id advise against it  im not the one you should be worried about jon
what are you doing here
i thought you might want to thank me i saved your life the least you could do is return the favour theres someone here trying to find me i need to know who it is
i dont know what youre talking about
i detected tachyon radiation you dont have anything that emits tachyons whos looking for me
i dont know
did they tell you that ridiculous story about their noble efforts to protect history the great temporal accord theyre lying to you jon none of it is true whoever contacted you is working for another faction they didnt come here to protect history they came to alter it who do you think was responsible for the antimatter cascade that nearly destroyed your ship it was them i was sent to prevent it
and why would you want to do that the first time we met you tried to kill me
i saved your ship because i was instructed to
by whom what does enterprise have to do with your temporal war
im not privy to that kind of information but i can tell you this whoevers looking for me is a danger to your crew if you want to continue on your mission youll help me find them
tpol to captain archer
archer here
weve finished the modifications
thanks ill be there in a few minutes
mister daniels is eager to get started
hell have to wait a few minutes archer out
youve been very helpful jon
its beginning
how long before we see the plume
well thats hard to predict every cycle is unique would you care to recite the invocation of renewal with us
id be honoured goran tonia agosoria
yoraya
yoraya uralan porporo gost
goran tonia agosoria yoraya uralan porporo gost

tyana morita
does this mean its working
its working
what is it
suliban biosigns hes somewhere on this deck i cant isolate him but hes close call lieutenant reed tell him to seal off c deck and it wouldnt hurt if he could get down here with a security team
whats that
you two should go
were not leaving
go bring help go
evacuate engineering everybody out
did they tell you that the twenty second century was going to be your final resting place
still skeptical tucker to captain archer captain are you there
hes in his quarters
tucker to doctor phlox
yes commander
meet us in the captains quarters on the double
on my way
easy captain aside from a nasty headache youre going to be fine you were stunned by a particle weapon
it was silik i guess he decided not to try and kill me this time
he wasnt quite as generous when it came to daniels hes dead sir
have our guests left yet
no the plume is just beginning
enterprise to captain fraddock
fraddock
im looking for one of your passengers have any of the ones who were here returned in the last hour or so
none
youre sure
the hatch has been sealed the entire time
thanks archer out
mister reed
yes sir
weve got a suliban loose on the ship
i want you to lock down every outer door and exit hatch post security teams on all decks
understood
do you think you can find him using daniels sensors
i can sure as hell try
get to engineering
yes sir
tpol thanks doc
captain
its gone he took it
took what
the device i told you about the one daniels used to show me all those things that kind of information could give an advantage to whomever siliks working for
bridge to captain archer
go ahead
someone just used our comm system to transmit a message
what kind of message
its encrypted sir
anything
im sorry captain i cant make heads or tails of most of this these might represent suliban biosigns but i wouldnt bet on it
bdeck service junction 59 somebodys trying to bypass the lock out codes for launch bay two
tell malcolm to meet me with a security team
captain ive got something that might give you a leg up
looks like he slipped through here we could remove these conduits but it would take some time
sir
stay here
very clever careful jon it would be a shame to trigger another antimatter cascade thered be nobody here to stop it
put that device on the floor
it would be in your best interest to let me take it
you keep saying youre here to help us but i cant stop wondering what kind of genetic enhancements youll get for bringing back that little prize eyes in the back of your head a pair of wings
thats a cynical attitude jon i thought your species was more trusting
theres a vessel approaching no bigger than a shuttlepod its suliban
im not going to ask you again put it down
youre going to kill me after i saved your life
you may have endangered your future jon
bridge to captain archer
yeah
a suliban vessel just took something in and went to warp should we go after them
no let em go
come in
the transport ship has left were ready to resume course have you learned how it works
not a clue starfleets in store for one hell of a report im not quite sure where to begin
id be glad to help
first thing in the morning i dont know about you but i could use a good nights sleep
agreed
mister reed assign new quarters to daniels roommate and seal off cabin e14 its offlimits til further notice
aye sir
god knows what else is in there lets get back on the road travis
echo two is away sir a clean launch
its made contact with echo one
how long before we get subspace online
id like to send a few test transmissions to calibrate amplifiers an hour
my guess is we have a lot of people on board waiting to call home
a vessel is dropping out of warp captain twelve kilometres dead ahead
put it up
look familiar
i dont recognise the configuration
good hail them this is the starship enterprise what can we do for you my name is jonathan archer were on a mission of exploration from the planet earth hoshi
the channels open sir
do you need assistance if you dont want to talk thats fine but you dropped in on us  was it something i said did you get anything on sensors
no
no what
no biosigns no propulsion or weapon signatures no readings at all
are there inhabited systems nearby
none
why fly right up to us just to give us the silent treatment
maybe they got our signal but it didnt make any sense to them our translator is far from perfect
i wouldnt take offense not every species has motives that can be understood in human terms
maybe they checked us out and decided we werent very interesting
us not interesting
lets calibrate the subspace amplifier at least the people back home want to talk to us
sir  i tracked them down it took me all week
where are they
kota baharu its in malaysia
what time is it there
a little after nine at night
that shouldnt be too late lets break in that new amplifier ill be in my ready room
is he all right
hes fine
is he in some kind of trouble
no sir malcolms doing a great job im sure you know its his birthday in a couple of days
yes yes it is september 2nd
we havent seen our son on his birthday for quite a few years
he called from san francisco to let us know hed been assigned to enterprise but we havent heard from him since
what are malcolms duties on your ship captain
hes my armoury officer
well his grandfather would be pleased he was an ordinance officer himself in the royal navy
it must be in malcolms blood
the reeds have been navy men for generations
until malcolm decided to join starfleet i suppose the ocean wasnt big enough for him
hes a long way from home in any case mister reed id like to do something for his birthday make him a special dinner i was hoping you could tell me what he likes to eat
captain malcolms never been comfortable making requests
im not sure i understand
he always ate whatever was put in front of him
are you saying he doesnt have a favourite food
not that hes ever told me
well if you happen to think of anything you can always contact me through starfleet
give malcolm our best
i will
safe journey captain
howd it go
could have gone better apparently he hasnt called home since we left earth i want you to find out what he likes to eat
me sir
but dont let malcolm know
maybe this is more in chefs area
were talking about a delicate assignment hoshi it needs your finesse
sir im running a diagnostic on our subspace transceiver array
get some help if you need it but make this a top priority thats an order
yes sir
where were you at dinner
i ate in my quarters now that weve got the amplifier working i wanted to answer a few letters
you missed tpols latest bout with chopsticks
damn dinner and a show
i thought you were going to upgrade this
that is the upgrade well if you want i can change the colour
whats the word from home
the usual engineering updates oh and duvall got promoted theyre giving him the shenandoah
duvall got his own command thank god were a hundred light years away
and i got a letter from natalie
the natalie from pensacola
yep natalie from pensacola looks like ive got a charge imbalance in this manifold ill get right on it
trip
you know they say longdistance relationships never work well this is about as longdistance as you can get
you okay
oh yeah i just i just wish id have had the chance to say goodbye face to face
let me ask you something do you spend much time with malcolm
i was in the armoury yesterday for a few hours swapping out some power relays
you talk about anything interesting
power relays
i talked to his parents this morning
really
yeah  sit if i asked your parents what you like to eat would they be able to tell me
are you kidding my mom would give you her recipe for panfried catfish and wouldnt let you go till you promised not to screw it up
malcolms parents didnt know what his favorite food was they didnt even know he was an armoury officer
thats strange
it made me think we dont know that much about malcolm do we
bridge to the captain
go ahead
the alien vessel has returned
guess we werent so uninteresting after all
they dropped out of warp five hundred kilometres dead ahead
i had to reverse engines to keep from banging into them
lets try this again
welcome back i was hoping wed have an opportunity to meet again the primary mission of my ship is to make peaceful contact with other species if theres anything we can do to assure you of our intentions  well its been nice talking to you lets do this again sometime
im picking up something
can you translate it
i dont think its a language
were being scanned
hull plating
its offline
hard about
theyve gone to warp sir
everybody okay
damage reports are coming in sir no ones been hurt
what the hell was that about
captain when they fired their weapon they dropped their shielding for about two seconds and i was able to take some scans
what did you get
biosigns at least fifteen maybe more
their dna doesnt match anything in our database
its a good thing theyre gone i doubt very much our torpedoes couldve penetrated their shielding
stay on longrange scanners if they come anywhere near us i want to know tpol
that support frames bent well need to reinforce it
how bad is it
if that last shot had been about a half a metre higher wed be looking at stars
hold it a minute
there were thirteen people working in this section captain including yours truly if that bulkhead had blown
did your people run into as many hostile aliens when they first went into deep space
it was a different time
how so
there were fewer warpcapable species
this ship just isnt equipped to handle some of the threats were coming up against its time we do something about that
what are you suggesting
enterprise was fitted with phase cannon ports but since we left spacedock a few weeks ahead of schedule the cannons were never installed
i think its time they were we should head back to earth
just give us two weeks captain
i know we can do it most of the stuff we need is already on the ship
the armoury team at jupiter station is trained for this kind of work if were going to do this lets do it right
my engineers are just as good as they are
i know that trip but we have other systems that could use overhauls look at the bright side youll got a chance to say goodbye to natalie
sir with your permission we could at least begin the work get a few things started for jupiter station
itll cut down the time well have to spend in spacedock
do what you can archer to mayweather
go ahead captain
were heading home
this ladies and gentlemen is a phasemodulated energy weapon its rated for a maximum power output of five hundred gigajoules enterprise was designed to carry three of them we have one and its only a prototype
our job is to get it up and running and build two more from scratch the captain is taking us back because he thinks this ought to be done by the boys in spacedock
far be it from me to question the captains judgment but commander tucker and i believe we can do this ourselves
that means double shifts by the time we reach jupiter station i dont want their engineers to have a thing to do but give us a wash and a wax any questions
are we expecting another attack sir
we all signed up for this trip because we wanted to do something no one had ever done before not because we thought itd be easy or safe but were not here to take foolish risks the captain and the rest of the crew are depending on us to keep enterprise ready for anything
and once we get these phase cannons online well have a lot more firepower to do just that
so what are you standing around for
he once told me that he loved to eat octopus especially the little suction cups but i think he was pulling my leg you can never tell whether my brothers joking or not can i talk to him
we really would like to keep this a surprise
oh right the dinner i remember one time this was at least ten years ago he went for a whole week without eating
really
got by on nothing but water and a little apple juice
why
some sort of survival training or was it a contest
when he started eating again do you remember the first thing he wanted
he was so weak he could barely get out of bed for two days all he had was protein concentrate
when you two were growing up he never said hey lets go out for pizza boy id love some indian food
not that i remember malcolm isnt the easiest person to get to know
im figuring that out
when we were training in san francisco there was a little restaurant on the embarcadero he liked to go to they had a specialty some kind of fish i think
what kind halibut swordfish
no
mahimahi scallops
i had sea bass
great and malcolm
i dont remember
try please
maureen
is that a fish
no she was the waitress thats why malcolm wanted to go there he had a thing for her i think he hates fish
thanks
so hows your secret mission coming
ive talked to his sister his best friend his uncle archie his two spinster aunts the most anyone seems to know about his eating habits is that he occasionally eats
ensign if you want to know something about mister reed perhaps you should ask him
anyone sitting here
er no please
this is the first chance ive had to eat all day
tell me about it i havent set foot outside the armoury since oh seven hundred
hows your ravioli
its fine
nothing like a nice plate of pasta you know i used to love to cook but i never get a chance to anymore and the way that chef protects the galley one of these nights i should fix something myself
im sorry
youd love my enchiladas
enchiladas
if you dont like them i can fix something else whats your favourite food
i appreciate the offer but it really isnt necessary
arent you getting a little tired of having to eat whatever chef happens to serve
no hes a fine cook
dont get me wrong hes terrific its just that dinner in the mess hall can lack a certain personal touch ive got a hot plate in my quarters
thats very flattering im just not sure it would be appropriate
what do you mean
well we work together and it just might be a little awkward serving on the same ship
what does that have to do with  oh no i didnt i didnt mean to imply anything other than just making dinner lieutenant
well then its my mistake then
no its my fault i shouldnt have yeah ill just
no please finish your dinner
no no no youve got a lot of work to do so
captain im detecting a ship dead astern eight thousand metres
let me guess our shadow
closing to seven thousand six thousand
polarise the hull plating
reed to bridge  armoury report get to your stations move
warp drive is offline
main power is down
torpedoes
tactical systems are down
why dont you save time and tell me what isnt down
the outer doors in launch bay two are opening
seal them
i cant
get away from those men
go archer to sickbay
phlox here captain
report to e deck section seven this is an emergency
on my way
security to captain archer
go ahead
the aliens are gone sir theyve launched their shuttle
bridge report
the alien vessel has gone to warp but that last shot damaged our port nacelle were venting drive plasma
doctor
ive stabilised them but they were subjected to some rather invasive scans
will they be all right
there could be some residual neurological damage but im doing everything i can
have you ever heard of anything like this
no
are there any vulcan records of a species that uses similar tactics and i dont care how classified they might be
none that i know of captain
find out what you can
tucker to archer
go ahead
weve got the plasma leak
under control but our port nacelle took a lot of damage
how long before we can go to warp
a couple of days
what about impulse power
thats the good news
it should be back online in a few minutes
ill take all the good news i can get keep me posted doctor
there are no vulcan ships within scanning range
sir we could try to contact the vulcan high command theyre only two days away at warp six im sure theyd give us a hand
im sure they would
i cant raise vulcan its funny i ran a diagnostic after the attack but now echo two wont respond
thats because it isnt there
what
theres nothing but debris at the coordinates where we deployed the amplifier
what about echo one
destroyed as well
the stabiliser on cannon port two checks out okay sir
port two or port one
port one sir sorry
get it right start on those beam emitters
yes sir
targeting scanners will be online in an hour
we should be aligning them by now not installing them
you were a little hard on eddie everyones busting their tails to get this job done
ow
you okay
yeah fine i told them to depolarise these relays
what were you trying to do
bypass the eps grid
why
well we could draw power for the cannons directly from the impulse engines
are you trying to make this blow up in your face
the relays were rated to handle that much power
what if theres a surge
ive thought of that these inverters were designed to cut in at the first sign of an overload
weve got to do this by the book or well end up blowing a bigger hole in ourselves than the bad guys
ive run a dozen simulations its an acceptable risk
when it comes to modifying ship systems why dont you let the chief engineer decide whats an acceptable risk
sir if we do this by the book those aliens are likely to be back before were done
i want to get this job done as quickly as you do lieutenant but not if it means taking shortcuts that could get our people killed
yes sir
dont you ever rest
you know i cant sleep without the warp engines online if i dont feel those vibrations something just doesnt seem right
well i hope you get them fixed soon because you look like hell
well with all due respect captain you shouldnt be talking
hows it coming
itll be online by the end of the day tomorrow guaranteed could you check the dilithium alignment for me
sure point oh six microns at least well be flying home under our own power
let me know if it drops below point oh three
i tried to get a message to the vulcan high command but it didnt go through if it had wed be expecting a surak class ship tomorrow oh so politely offering to help us
well the vulcans would have loved that towing the pride of starfleet back to base
maybe we should thank our visitors for blowing up the subspace amplifiers its holding at point oh five
keep an eye on it
you looking forward to seeing earth
sure i just didnt think id be seeing it so soon
this time we wont be leaving before were ready
are your ears a little pointier than usual
i nev
i never said we didnt belong out here i just wish wed have launched with all our systems online especially weapons
if we hadnt launched when we did theyd have sent klaang back to kronos in a box
i keep reminding myself of that but i rushed us out of spacedock because i had something to prove and i risked the lives of eighty one humans a vulcan and a denobulan to do it
dont forget porthos
thanks
in the old days astronauts rode rockets with millions of litres of hydrogen burning under their seats you think they said gee id love to go to the moon today but it seems a little risky i think if you asked anyone on board whether they thought this mission was worth the risk youd get the same answer from every one of them
let me know when were ready to go to warp
aye sir
have you still got those guns of yours hooked up to the impulse engines
im just disconnecting them now
hang on a minute youre sure thisll work
yes commander i am
then based on the recommendation of the armoury officer the chief engineer finds the level of risk acceptable
in that case if the chief engineer wouldnt mind getting his hands dirty i could use some help
my crew has managed to do in forty eight hours what wouldve taken the armoury team at jupiter station at least a week to say that im proud of them would be an understatement were preparing our first test everybody has their fingers crossed including me
youre sure theres nothing down there
yes captain
not even a microbe i dont want to blow up something that could evolve into a sentient species in a couple of billion years
theres nothing there
archer to lieutenant reed have you got a lock
yes captain
lets start small shave a couple of metres off the top of that peak
acquiring the target full power to the primary coils  phase cannons one and two standing by
mister reed the honour is all yours  i just asked for a little off the top
check the cannons be careful down there the blast yield was ten times what we expected
what happened
something overloaded the phase modulators
the plasma recoil blew out relays across decks c and d
im getting an anomalous reading from launch bay two
trip tpol
there whats that
you think thats whats causing the power surge
its very likely its putting out a tremendous amount of energy over six hundred megajoules
theyre toying with us they want us to know they can destroy us whenever they want even with our own weapons
whatever it is its tapped into most of our systems including internal sensors and communications on every deck
activate visual sensor j15 i assume you planted that device because you wanted to learn more about us
ill be happy to give you a quick lesson were not here to make enemies but just because were not looking for a fight doesnt mean well run away from one you may think youve left us defenceless but let me tell you something about humans we dont give up easily well protect enterprise any way we can
doctor
ill be with you in a moment ensign
i see you released your patients
theyre going to be fine i sent them back to their quarters to rest
thats good to hear
what can i do for you
many times
any idea what his favourite food might be
ah the birthday dinner well the man loves a good breakfast
like what
eggs ive seen him eat a lot of eggs
how does he like them
scrambled poached over easy
maybe chef could make him a big omelette
oh and he enjoys pancakes on occasion he has the odd habit of spreading peanut butter on them sausage thats another favourite bacon too come to think of it
is there any one food in particular
not that i recall
breaking a vulcan encryption code would be easier than this
if anything comes to mind ill let you know
i dont suppose scanning his taste buds would help
medically speaking theres no accounting for taste
thanks anyways
bromelin
sorry
i think i can help you ensign but it would mean going into mister reeds medical record that information is confidential
im under direct orders from the captain couldnt you make an exception
under the circumstances i suppose it wouldnt hurt ive made it a point to study each crewmans medical history and i remember noticing that lieutenant reed suffers from a number of allergies lets see dust mites oak pollen tropical grasses ah ha ha here it is hes averse to various plant enzymes including bromelin
what does all of this have to do with what he likes to eat
over the last several years hes been taking regular injections so that his body can tolerate bromelin
a plant enzyme
yes
found in
among other things pineapple
pineapple
this doesnt mean its his favourite food
its close enough thank you doctor
its them
where are they
closing from astern twenty thousand metres fifteen
should i try evasive manoeuvres
no come about and hold our position bridge to the armoury guess whos back
we see them both forward cannons are charged and ready
get a lock and standby
theyve stopped eleven thousand metres
were being hailed
put it through
defenceless
prepare to surrender your vessel you are defenseless prepare to surrender your vessel
shut it off
ten thousand metres nine
mister reed both cannons fire
im reading a fluctuation in their shielding but its marginal
five thousand metres
is that the best we can do lieutenant
even if these cannons had been installed at jupiter station they wouldnt be any more effective than they are now
what about yesterday i saw you blow something up the size of mount mckinley
yes sir but that was due to an overload
can you overload them again
sir after the damage from the first time the plasma recoil would probably knock out two decks
can you overload them again
i believe so
id rather knock out two decks than surrender this ship
but sir
hold on a minute i think theres a way to handle the recoil
how
all that excess energys got to go somewhere
why not put it to use
three thousand metres
if we repolarise the gravity plating to absorb the recoil
then we can shunt the energy to structural integrity
sounds good to me
the gravplating wasnt designed
to withstand that much force
we all understand the risks get started
aye sir
one thousand metres
malcolm
stand by trip were ready sir
then fire
their shields are failing
torpedoes
bridge to the armoury everything okay down there
we blew out the plasma relays on b deck but its nothing we cant take care of what about our friends
i have a feeling
their repairs are going to be a little more extensive
howd the cannons hold up
fairly well
ill have them back online within the hour
the aft cannon should be working by the end of day tomorrow
good work well i see no reason for us to go back to jupiter station now do you
no
at least theres one good thing about coming back this far we can drop another subspace amplifier
get on it travis resume our previous course
gladly sir
to our mysterious friends i wish i couldve seen the looks on their faces
hear hear
dont get too used to drinking on duty but you did your jobs pretty damn well yesterday id say that deserves a little celebration
cheers
if you really want to thank us how about letting us sleep in tomorrow
permission granted hoshi what can we do for you
sorry to interrupt captain i have that component that you asked for
great put it down right here  as long as weve got you here malcolm
happy birthday
you shouldnt have gone to any trouble
oh no trouble at all
mister reed the honour is yours
pineapple thats my favourite how on earth did you know
we have our sources
good morning everyone be patient
ah someone had a busy night
dont worry i didnt forget you
now lets try it without biting my fingers this time
people are getting jealous you get more letters from home than anyone on this ship whats her name
its nothing like that theyre from doctor lucas hes a colleague from the interspecies medical exchange
i didnt know there were humans serving on denobula
hes the first he helped me get settled in when i came to san francisco im trying to return the favour
i had a pen pal once when i was twelve from brisbane australia and i loved getting her letters it was like this little window into distant places with strange sounding names
the curiosity of an explorer even then
are we still on for later
oh yes im looking forward to it if you think youre ready we can tackle gerunds today
i can hardly wait
my dear doctor phlox its me again jeremy i hope you are well its been a hell of a week here wall to wall emergencies and three midnight deliveries its mating season so you know how that goes i thought human reproduction was complicated you denobulans make us look like singlecell organisms
dear doctor lucas sorry to hear about your difficult week i know the rigours of mating season only too well it might help to bear in mind that a dose of niaxilin can be quite effective in separating the two combatants it sounds like youve settled into your new living quarters that part of the city has some very lively kaybin bars along the river
up here doc
theyre open all night if i recall please dont venture inside them unescorted they can be quite disturbing to the uninitiated
he was trying to reroute a nitrogen valve and the seal blew how bad is it
oh its superficial only first degree burns a little dermoline gel should do the trick
most of my work is fairly routine scrapes and bruises the occasional emergency and youll be pleased to hear that the crew finally seems to be growing accustomed to an alien doctor on board i must admit i wasnt planning to stay this long but the opportunity to observe your species on their first deep space venture has proven irresistible
lieutenant i saved a seat for you
yeah another time doctor im due back in the armoury
its a bit daunting at times trying to socialise with the crew form friendships but our profession guarantees that sooner or later everyone comes to see us it makes interaction quite a bit easier
its just a little gastrointestinal distress
he hasnt been himself lately
well youve been feeding him cheese again havent you youve got to learn how to say no captain
no more dairy products you hear that doctors orders
i never thought id meet a species that forges such intimate bonds with lesser creatures its surprising the things you humans choose to invest your emotions in
sorry to bother you with this
no bother he was one of my more cooperative patients today
thanks doc  see all the trouble you cause
ive noticed how the captain seems to anthropomorphise his pet he even talks to the creature although im fairly certain it has no idea what hes saying then again ive been known to speak to my pyrithian bat on occasion
we wont be going to america this time but always i go with you wherever you go understand you go now maria
no i stay with you roberto
no maria what i do now i do alone i couldnt do it if you were here if you go then i go too dont you see how it is whichever one there is
no no
we can go if youre bored
no no id like to stay and see what happens
you wont be disappointed the endings classic
no not the film im sensing a rising emotional undercurrent in the room im curious to see if it culminates in some kind of group response
they dont have movies where you come from do they
we had something similar a few hundred years ago but they lost their appeal when people discovered their real lives were more interesting
still its nice to take a break from real life every now and then dont you think
i suppose it is
i am you now and you are me now you understand and youre going well and fast and far
something in my eye
stand up now and go and we both go stand up maria remember youre me too
its remarkable doctor even fictional characters seem to elicit human compassion my shipmates have calmly faced any number of dangers and yet a simple movie can bring tears to their eyes
temporal vein
temporal vein internal maxillary
and what is the maxillary connected to
posterior auricular
very good the external jugular
oh er superior vena cava
and that leads to
oh easy the seat of all joy and sadness
physiologically it is nothing more than a very efficient pump what could possibly make you people think it is the source of all emotion
you know you may know about our cardiopulmonary system but you have a lot to learn about the human heart  this is me
good night
oh doctor i just wanted to thank you it was fun tonight
youre welcome
er theyre showing another one next week sunset boulevard i think you might like it
im sure i will
see you tomorrow oh sorry i forgot denobulans dont like to be touched
its all right im trying to shed some of my cultural inhibitions
oh in that case
good night
since we were on the subject of mating i think crewman cutler may be romantically interested in me i cant be certain however the pheromones of human females arent as potent as denobulans
are there any inhabited systems nearby
theres a minshara class planet less than a light year away
the ships not answering our hails captain
its definitely prewarp sir it could be unmanned maybe a probe of some kind
any biosigns
two but theyre very faint
bring it into launch bay two and tell doctor phlox he might have a couple of patients
we found your ship adrift we thought we might be able to help
trenakadula ta morana dona
i need a little more
im jonathan archer youre on the starship enterprise
kandala vaganish yoreta vala
can you understand me
who are you what planet
earth were from earth
this is a warp vessel
yes
we left valakis over a year ago along with three other ships
why
you must have noticed our condition by now
i detected the illness
twelve million of us died the year before we left i can only imagine how many have died since our doctors cant find a cure but a more advanced people people with warp technology like you your medical science must be more effective
youve encountered other warpcapable species
the mklexa and the ferengi they both visited our world do you know them
no
are you the ships doctor
i am
my people are dying will you allow him to help us
any thoughts
they did come looking for us and considering theyve already met two other warpcapable species the risk of contamination seems acceptable
see what you can do
thank you
if this letter arrives later than usual doctor i hope youll forgive me ive been presented with a rather unusual case involving a pair of alien astronauts it may not surprise you that they landed in my sickbay through an act of human compassion i said before that my duties entail the occasional emergency emergencies it seems come in all shapes and sizes i was once nearly overwhelmed by fifty patients in a refugee camp on matalas captain archer is now asking me to take responsibility for over fifty million
how are your patients
their condition is grave but theyre resting for now
im sure youll find a way to help them
your syntax is improving continue
do you like the food
the sauce is good but i dont care for this vegetable
eggplants not a vegetable its a nostril
its a nostril
a fruit  ive noticed you and crewman cutler spending a lot of time together is there something going on between you two
in denobulan please
are you two mating
i believe the word youre searching for is dating
well are you
well are you
im not exactly sure
there are ways you can tell  does she want to spend time with you does she find excuses to  to make physical contact
well she did kiss me on the cheek the other night
in denobulan doctor
do you have any advice
i think you make a very cute washboard
i beg your pardon
couple a cute couple
its pretty crowded out there a lot of spacecraft and artificial satellites
nothing i cant avoid sir
put us in a low orbit travis theyre expecting us
the captain has committed all our resources to helping people he didnt even know existed two days ago once again i am struck by your species desire to help others
it seems the more aggressively we treat the illness the more resistant it becomes
whats the current rate of infection
one out of three
its a full blown epidemic
these are in the most advanced stage
youre treating them with a synthetic antibody
its effective at first but the disease mutates once it moves into the respiratory system theres no way of controlling it pulmonary failure usually follows in a few days
captain treatment with priaxate should ease the symptoms in the sickest patients at least temporarily i can easily show the valakians how to synthesize as much as they need
go ahead
ill need all of the lab work you have and case histories of patients in every stage of the disease
certainly
excuse me were the ones that brought him here can you tell me how hes doing
dak mul ahna
im sorry could you say that again
we should assign some crewmen to watch doctor phlox and his equipment
i dont think these people are about to steal anything
your experience with lesser civilisations is limited captain you might be surprised what a temptation our technology can be
dak mul ahna kal ah ku dah
hoshi
captain the ut cant translate his language
dukat ah pra kee larr
he doesnt speak the same language as you
no hes menk theyre not as evolved as valakians but theyre very hard workers
theyre indigenous to this planet
is that so strange
on most of the planets weve encountered only one species of humanoids survived the evolutionary process
you two are not from the same planet
no we may look alike but the similarity ends there
i dont see any menk patients here where are they being treated
they havent contracted the disease
have you looked into their immunity
it was one of the first things we pursued but menk and valakian are physiologically incompatible
still could be significant id like to see your data on the menk as well
of course
i had meant to transmit this letter by now but the valakian epidemic has been taking up most of my time working with the physicians here has been quite fulfilling i suppose its the reason we joined the interspecies medical exchange but i worry about falsely raising their hopes despite captain archers confidence in me im afraid the scale of the disaster may outweigh our best intentions ive decided to enlist crewman cutlers help in my task
so what are the menk like
youll have the chance to see for yourself youre a trained exobiologist id find your assistance in the field invaluable
thank you doctor
on a personal note the affection crewman cutler is showing has left me a bit perplexed so ive decided to discuss it with the one person on board who might understand the complexities of the situation
thats impossible
its nothing to be ashamed of
my teeth were sealed with a trifluorinate compound twenty three years ago
well normal wear and tear has allowed some decay to sneak in see for yourself there on your anterior tricuspid
im sure you have more pressing concerns ill come back later
im waiting for the computer to analyse some tissue samples itll only take a moment to repair
open please wider youve lived among humans for quite some time now subcommander im curious have you ever known them to mate outside their species ah there it is
are you asking out of personal interest or scientific curiosity
both i suppose theres a crewman on board ive become close with i think shes attracted to me
in my experience humans lack the emotional maturity for interspecies relationships they tend to be easily infatuated with things they find new this crewman may simply be satisfying her curiosity at your expense
open
subcommander tpol has a very pragmatic feel of the universe i admire her logic although she lacks the instinctiveness that a more emotional response can provide somehow i find this unsettling
there that wasnt so bad thanks for your insights
be careful
come in
you asked to see me captain
ive just gotten a call from the director of the clinic hes eager to hear if youve made any progress doctor
ive developed a medication to ease the symptoms of the disease but
but
this epidemic isnt being caused by a virus or bacteria the proteins that bind to their chromosomes are deteriorating their illness is genetic its been going on for thousands of years but the rate of mutation has accelerated over the last few generations based on my projections the valakians will be extinct in less than two centuries i wish i had better news
what about a cure
genetic abnormalities on this level are very difficult to reverse
but not impossible
no i still believe the menk immunity could be the key to a cure i plan to study them in more detail
take all the time you need
when i began to practice medicine i had no idea it would take me on journeys to other worlds every species i encounter allows me to explore a new physiology at the moment i find myself in the enviable position of studying two humanoids from the same planet its a rare and exciting opportunity
tell them wed like to run some tests take samples of their blood it will be completely painless
kuhl toh bah
kuhl pra toh bah aren so ltee
ylyn parum ta see ettaj
hes says theyd be happy to help
as fascinating as the two species are from a biological standpoint its their ability to coexist that intrigues me the most the valakians are highly evolved technologically advanced while the menk are relatively primitive by comparison to my surprise the two seem to be living side by side peacefully
pra du matta
pra ducat matta ku mampah
koh utah
he wants to know what youre doing
have you learned enough menk to explain a molecular bio scan
doctor er esatta prah koo kuvalakii
whatd you say
i told him the doctor was looking inside of him
thank you
tik tik
nan dah
youre welcome
neek rasata food
did he just say food
rasata food
have you been teaching him english
no he must have picked it up by listening to us
perhaps weve found an assistant comm officer
no food
tik tik
tik tik
i havent seen any crops or livestock i wonder where they get this
larr ku rasata gol dach
pah ku mano nda tomah
he says the soil here isnt good for planting
gol dach puu kani valakii hrat atiba si ohno
the valakians dont let them live where the land is fertile
valakii fora tlet rasata kee akem pinj erana
the valakians give them whatever they need food clothing medicine
menk akata y valakii
he says the valakians are good to them they protect them
despite the menks insistence that theyre treated well my human crewmates seem to see things differently
tik tik well thats the last one
they think the menk are being exploited by the valakians so their first instinct is to rise to their defence despite the fact that the menk dont appear to need or want a defender
wait a moment
impressive
whatd he do
hes grouped the samples together by family crossreferenced by bloodlines and marriage if im interpreting the colour codes correctly tik tik
on the surface the menk appear to be a primitive species unsophisticated even by human standards no offence but their abilities appear to have been underestimated even by myself
it seems like a vacation if i didnt keep remembering why we were here
im going to help larr finish packing up hes back on duty at the hospital in an hour
this really doesnt bother you
what
the way the valakians treat them
why should it on most worlds with two humanoid species one would have driven the other to extinction here theyve developed a symbiotic relationship that seems to work quite well
they force the menk to live in compounds they treat them almost like pets
their culture is different its their way
doesnt make it right
are you married crewman
of course not i would have told you
im married
you are
three times
so you have two exwives
i have three current wives and they each have two husbands not counting myself
is that considered normal for denobulans
quite
why are you telling me this
ive been getting certain signals from you that suggest you may be interested in a romantic relationship with me
oh
unless i misinterpreted those signals
you didnt but i still dont know why youre telling me this
you need to know that my culture is different
that doesnt matter
it doesnt this cultures different that seems to matter to you a great deal
phlox as far as your extended family goes im not interested in becoming wife number four i just want to be your friend
what do you mean by friend
lets just see where it goes
captain im glad you could come
it was no problem how are you feeling
the medication you gave us helps with the pain but my prognosis hasnt changed
were trying to do something about that i have a lot of faith in doctor phlox
i wanted to thank you for getting me home before it was too late it took us a year to get out to where you found us you brought us home in a day
we started out in ships very similar to yours someday youll be travelling just as fast as we are
someday may not be soon enough if your doctor cant help us we need to keep searching for others that can we need warp drive a million more of us will die before our next ship even leaves this system with warp engines we wont have to wait for people to find us we can seek help on our own
you may not find that everyone you meet wants to help you
still we have to try
archer
its phlox captain weve collected all the samples
ill meet you at the shuttlepod archer out
anything to report
weve received twenty nine hails in the past two hours
from whom
apparently word of our arrival has spread quickly other clinics are requesting help two orbital spacecraft approached us while you were on the planet they mistakenly believed that we already had a cure we had to turn them away
do you have a minute
the valakians want our warp technology
what did you tell them
that id think about it
and
safe to say i know where you stand on the subject
even if you give them our reactor schematics they dont have the technical expertise to build a warp engine
they have no experience working with antimatter i doubt they even realize how dangerous it is theyre not ready
then your decision shouldnt be difficult
we could stay and help them
the vulcans stayed to help earth ninety years ago were still there
i never thought id say this but im beginning to understand how the vulcans must have felt
trouble sleeping captain
looks like im not the only one
actually denobulans require very little rest unless you count our annual hibernation cycle
am i going to be without my doctor this winter
only for six days
maybe ill join you any progress
the research has been challenging to say the least
a cure doctor have you found a cure
even if i could find one im not sure it would be ethical
ethical
wed be interfering with an evolutionary process that has been going on for thousands of years
every time you treat an illness youre interfering thats what doctors do
youre forgetting about the menk
what about the menk
ive been studying their genome as well and ive seen evidence of increasing intelligence motor skills linguistic abilities unlike the valakians they appear to be in the process of an evolutionary awakening it may take millennia but the menk have the potential to become the dominant species on this planet
and that wont happen as long as the valakians are around
if the menk are to flourish they need an opportunity to survive on their own
well what are you suggesting we choose one species over the other
all im saying is that we let nature make the choice
the hell with nature youre a doctor you have a moral obligation to help people who are suffering
im also a scientist and im obligated to consider the larger issues thirty five thousand years ago your species coexisted with other humanoids isnt that correct
go ahead
what if an alien race had interfered and given the neanderthals an evolutionary advantage fortunately for you they didnt
i appreciate your perspective on all of this but were talking about something that might happen might happen thousands of years from now theyve asked for our help i am not prepared to walk away based on a theory
evolution is more than a theory it is a fundamental scientific principle forgive me for saying so but i believe your compassion for these people is affecting your judgment
my compassion guides my judgment
captain
can you find a cure doctor
i already have
two days ago when we first discovered the alien shuttle i had no idea that id be facing a dilemma of this magnitude for the first time i find myself in conflict with my captain but he is my captain and hes placed a great deal of trust in me i believe i owe him the same i only hope that he is willing to look beyond his sympathy for these poor people
doctor
captain
im going down to the valakian hospital
sir it would go against all my principles if i didnt ask you to reconsider what i
i have reconsidered i spent the whole night reconsidering and what ive decided goes against all my principles someday my people are going to come up with some sort of a doctrine something that tells us what we can and cant do out here should and shouldnt do but until somebody tells me that theyve drafted that directive im going to have to remind myself every day that we didnt come out here to play god
id like to think doctor lucas that if id had the chance to talk to you face to face youd have never let me even consider withholding my findings from the captain but im ashamed to say that i almost did just that
phlox tells me this medicine will help ease the symptoms for a decade maybe more a lot can happen in that time i wouldnt be surprised if you developed a cure on your own
and if we dont with a warp capable starship our chances would be greatly improved
im sorry
this will give you detailed instructions on how to synthesise more of the medicine
we appreciate everything youve done
if i hadnt trusted him to make the right choice id have been no better than the vulcan diplomats who held your species back because they felt you couldnt make proper decisions on your own
i came very close to misjudging jonathan archer but this incident has helped me gain a new respect for him happiness and health to you doctor your dedicated colleague phlox
you wanted to see me
please
for doctor lucas
itll go out first thing in the morning everything all right
fine fine the past few days have been taxing
want my advice get out of sickbay
yes perhaps youre right
good night
good night phlox to crewman cutler
go ahead
i er know its short notice but i was wondering if you might like to join me for a little snack in the mess hall i could use a friend right about now
ten minutes
thank you sweet dreams
you have a ten second firing window ready
ready
go
time
any better
your hit to miss ratio is still below fifty percent if those had been live rounds youd have blown out two or three bulkheads
i never had this much trouble with the em33
this is an entirely new weapon unlike the em33 you dont have to compensate for particle drift just point straight at the target and try and keep your shoulders relaxed its hard to aim accurately when youre tense ahem
you all right
yeah fine youll get the hang of it lets try for twenty seconds this time
i thought we were staying at warp for the next few days
were approaching a gas giant class nine
so much for target practice
well pick it up tomorrow
the probes entered the outer atmosphere
can we clean up the signal
im trying sir theres a lot of em interference it sounds very strange
intense magnetic fields often create unique waveforms
lets hear them
siren calls thats what we called them when i was a kid my dad would put them through the speakers whenever we flew by a gas giant it gave me nightmares sometimes
other than keeping ensign mayweather up at night im not sure what we expect to accomplish here there are four gas giants in your own solar system
none of them are class nine i think this ones worth a closer look
im reading an anomalous power signature in the lower atmosphere and several biosigns
get the probe closer
aye sir
we can travel faster than the speed of light youd think we could find a cure for the common cold
you should be grateful a human cold is so mild i once had a patient with the kamaraazite flu he sneezed so violently he nearly regurgitated his pineal gland
i dont see how i could actually catch a cold on a hermetically sealed starship
oh you may have picked up the virus from a piece of equipment it could have been lurking inside a sealed container
i did open a case of plasma coolant
whoever packed that case was probably nursing a cold
but that was back in spacedock five months ago
you underestimate the tenacity of a virus lieutenant it can lay dormant for months adapt to whatever environment it finds itself in this should ease the symptoms
but the only cure i know of involves bed rest
no thatll have to wait the captain wants me on the team investigating that shipwreck
well you wont be contagious inside an environment suit just try not to sneeze in your helmet
ill do my best
come in hoshi
do you have a minute sir
of course whats on your mind
that shipwreck we have no idea what type of life forms well find on that alien vessel and theres a lot of interference in the atmosphere are you sure the away team wont need a translator
they have their uts and well try to keep an open comlink
what about the language on the control panels the hatches they might need someone to help them find their way around
are you trying to tell me something
i realise that i havent always been the first one in line to volunteer for this type of mission but i want you to know that i am prepared to go took a while but i think i finally got my space legs
i never doubted that youd find them your timing couldnt be better tpol just asked me to assign you to the team youd better get to the launch bay before they leave without you
aye sir
i thought you were acquainted with the environmental suit
i am im just brushing up on the backup systems i wouldnt want the emergency oxygen to fail during a hull breach
trust me ensign if theres a hull breach the pressure will crush you to something about this big
i requested you for your skills as a translator but if youre uncomfortable
im perfectly comfortable i used to find the suits a little claustrophobic but im getting used to them ill see you in the shuttlepod
its one hundred kilometres below us still descending
gravitys pulling it deeper into the atmosphere at their current altitude the pressure is fifteen thousand gsc
thats well within our hull tolerance
for the moment but at the rate that vessel is sinking well have an hour at most
you sound uncomfortable subcommander
im merely stating facts
well be on our way back well before were in any danger i for one have no interest in imploding a valuable shuttlepod
or three valuable officers
weve entered an eddy of liquid helium were clear
that wasnt so bad
one hundred metres
is that a hatch on the port side
i see it
fifty metres forty
whats that
its just the proximity alarm
twenty metres ten engaging docking interface
nitrogenoxygen atmosphere carbon dioxide levels are high but nothings toxic its breathable
you first
perhaps we should leave the helmets on
what is it
you cant smell that
no this damn cold
count your blessings
you two might want to take a look at this
it says deck two red sector
what language
klingon
i thought you knew klingon ships why didnt you recognise this one from the outside
there are many classes of ships im not familiar with all of them
so im assuming you dont know how many klingons are on board
im reading three biosigns that way all very weak
how weak
theyre still alive we should leave before they regain consciousness
and what if they dont the atmospheres going to crush this ship like an eggshell pretty soon
shouldnt we try to help them
they dont want our help
how do you know
theyre klingons to die at their post assures them a path to the afterlife if we rescue them theyd be dishonoured
well i for one dont intend to just fly off and let these people die honourable deaths or not
your compassion is admirable but misguided if they awake and find us on their ship theyll kill us
how many are there
three on the bridge but im detecting at least nine more biosigns on board
you cant tell what happened to them
im detecting residual amounts of an carbon dioxide based neurotoxin but it seems to have dissipated theres not enough to affect us
stand by how long is the pods hull going to hold up
at their present rate of descent half hour give or take
tpol
yes captain
youve got twenty minutes to see if you can do anything for that crew then i want you out of there
understood
i dont believe theres anything we can do in twenty minutes i suggest we leave now
you have a margin of safety
captain tpol to enterprise
damn interference
or weve dropped out of comm range
we still have twenty minutes
it doesnt make sense to place ourselves at risk when theyd rather die
there must be something we can do maybe they have a distress beacon we can activate
i doubt youll find one klingons dont call for help
what if we carry some of them into the pod we could save three or four
and if they wake up on the trip back to enterprise
whats that
its our shuttlepod taking off
try it now
archer to tpol whats your status
theyre back in comm range
captain
shuttlepod one respond
sir theyre heading into open space
im picking up something
dujto chak wa kah deesh paklah kah deesh paklah
sounds like klingon
ill try to tie in the ut
chak wa kah deesh paklah kah deesh paklah kiv duj in range respond weve been attacked by an unknown ship designation enterprise nx01 any warships in range respond
set a pursuit course
aye sir
bring the grappler online
weve got it
bridge to security send a team to launch bay one trip the bridge is yours travis
yes sir
everybody all right
archer to the bridge
mayweather
have you still got a fix on the shipwreck
yes sir
transfer the coordinates to the launch bay im going back for the boarding party
sir the alien ship sunk another two thousand metres its below the shuttles safety limits
then polarise the hull plating well take enterprise down
theres got to be some way off this ship
what about escape pods
i dont know about the structural integrity of klingon escape pods my guess is were better off in here
its irrelevant lieutenant klingons dont use escape pods it would be considered an act of cowardice to abandon ship
maybe we can use their comm system to contact enterprise
i doubt their comm will penetrate the em field any better than our own if we can access their helm controls we might be able to put this vessel into a stable orbit
i havent had much experience at piloting klingon ships
we have no other choice
start translating those consoles look for anything marked propulsion helm navigation
ill try but reading klingon is a lot different than speaking it
we could always try waking one of them to help us
all right  kolat chack tabak plasma containment maybe
youre certain
containment im certain
pudah dak cha something they call photon torpedoes
photon torpedoes ive never heard of anything like that what else
well this all looks like weapons systems torpedoes tactical sensors disruptor arrays
what about this one
i recognise pressure katahl that can mean wall or barrier
or hull
maybe
if im reading this correctly weve got a few hours at most the hull integritys failing
then wed better hurry this appears to be the helm station
i think youre right quee nagah impulse drive
good work hoshi
hoshi
it says the pressures failing in the jkhat bah fusion manifold do you know what that means
to quote our very own mister tucker that means were dead in the water
archer to boarding party come in
we read you captain
how are you holding up
were doing okay sir its nice to hear your voice
whats your status
weve been attempting to restart their engines but they appear to be offline
dont worry about it were coming to get you
travis how much farther
ten thousand metres but im having a hard time getting a fix on them too much interference
is our probe still working
barely
try using it to triangulate their position
the probes gone
sir external pressures at maximum
im afraid weve got a little hitch in our rescue plan
the hull platings failing
well be back for you as soon as we can
in the meantime just sit tight
captain youre breaking up captain
release me cowards let me die on my feet
tpol was right theres a neurotoxin in her bloodstream untreated it could kill her within a day or two
can you do anything
im working on it
tpol said the klingons were unconscious why is this one so lively
shes showing the effects of hypothermia my guess is she took refuge in a low temperature environment aboard her ship the cold would have delayed the effects of the toxin
i demand to speak to your captain
you know i read if they sense a leaders weak theyll try to kill him and take command
im the captain
ive never seen your kind before but you have made an enemy of the klingon empire
from what ive noticed thats not hard to do you stranded three of my people down there
you raided my vessel infected my crew
we didnt infect anyone we boarded your ship to try and help
liar
look i dont know what happened to your crew but we had nothing to do with it now your vessel is sinking deeper into the atmosphere and unless we do something itll be destroyed
better that than let it fall into your hands
ive got three very capable people on your ship let them help if you tell them how to get the engines running they can fly it out of there
and fly it where back to your world to steal our secrets
no
when our birds of prey arrive your ship will be destroyed
remind me to stop trying to help people
i found these schematics in the vulcan database its a raptor class scout vessel
how long will it last down there
its hulls at least twice as thick as ours reinforced with some kind of coherent molecular alloy
yeah its a tough little ship but it cant hold up under that pressure forever what if we use duratanium braces to reinforce a shuttlepod it wont look pretty but it might hold up long enough for us to get our people out
our only other option is for tpol and malcolm to fix a brokendown klingon ship and fly it out themselves
i dont think were going to get any help from our guest in sickbay get started on those braces
keep an eye out for any klingon ships coming this way
aye sir
the one time we need our chief engineer is the one time we leave him behind
come look at this
oonos thrott nej jos mich ka xanant ach pagh qtahl class planet we destroyed their ship but weve sustained damage in our port fusion injector weve descended into the outer atmosphere of a qtahl class planet to make repairs in case there are other xarantine ships in the area my crew is falling ill and i have been unable to determine why if we had died when the xarantine attacked our honour would be secure but to fall victim to some disease to be crushed into nothing in the depths of this miserable planet
sounds like we need to find the port fusion injector
wait i saw that somewhere here one deck below us its in the reactor pit
reactor pit could that be engineering
could be
this one
no that says something about plasma induction here it is port fusion injector
i think i might have made a tactical error dealing with the klingon woman i asked her for help she could see that as a sign of weakness
you been boning up on your klingon psychology
weve run into them three times and every time theyve wanted to destroy us id love to figure out why
well maybe the best thing is just to steer clear of them
that may not be so easy we could use their help right now if we can reestablish a comm signal with tpol and the others the klingon woman could probably talk them through the repairs but shes got a thousand generations of instinct telling her not to trust me
maybe its time you started thinking like a klingon
sickbay to captain archer
go ahead
youll be pleased to know ive developed an antitoxin theres an interesting wrinkle though when you have a moment id like to share it with you
argh
are you okay
yes i seem to be getting a little lightheaded must be the heat
youre dehydrated you need some water
i saw a galley on the schematics deck four blue sector ill see what i can find
you shouldnt go alone
watch yourselves
its called gagh its a klingon delicacy but only when theyre alive
they look like worms
they are worms
ugh
targs klingons prefer their food freshly slaughtered are you all right
i promised myself i wouldnt do this
youre in a dangerous situation in an alien environment your anxiety is understandable
dont you mean for a human
you cant deny your nature
this may sound strange but i envy you sometimes i know another pesky human emotion but there are times i wish i could just ignore my feelings bury them the way vulcans do
take my hand
excuse me
my hand close your eyes
think of yourself on a turbulent ocean you have the power to control the waves
whatever it is youre trying to do its not working
focus the waves are subsiding the water is growing still youre in control
that was amazing
when we return to the ship ill teach you how to do it on your own
thanks
lieutenant reed report
the hull pressures approaching critical this ships about to be crushed
itll work
if youre wrong you could destroy the ship
look even with hoshis help it could take hours just to find the fusion injector in here were out of time
i say we try the weapons
how do you know you can even access the tactical systems
if theres one thing on board this ship i ought to be able to figure out its the torpedoes
id like to run one more structural diagnostic before you launch
qapla
beg your pardon
success i decided to take your advice about thinking like a klingon the vulcan database has about nine hundred pages on them
learn anything
plenty theyre driven by a warrior mentality they tend to view anyone they meet as a potential enemy
that may explain why our guest is so irritable
they also have a strong sense of duty er heh cho mruak tah death before dishonour finish up that diagnostic ill be in sickbay
going to go put your homework to use
something like that
please relax if you strain against the straps you might hurt yourself
whats that is that what you used against my crew
doctor phlox has developed an antidote to the neurotoxin in your system
is this how you plan to gain my trust first poison me then miraculously cure me
have you had a drink lately
what
the bioagent that affected you and your crew was consumed apparently in alcohol
specifically the toxin was bonded to a molecule unique to xarantine ale
there was a raid
yes i can understand your not wanting to talk about it if the raid went badly for you
the xarantines are no match for us we attacked their outpost and took what we wanted
and that included some xarantine ale
did your whole crew drink it
the triumph belonged to all
ill take that as a yes it was that ale that infected you not us think about it when did your crew start getting sick was it right after the raid after you celebrated your victory
this is a trick
is it how do you feel better or worse since the injection we can make enough of this for your entire crew if its not too late what if this isnt a trick what if were telling you the truth youd be letting your crew die a very dishonourable death when you could have saved them can you live with that
one thousand metres two thousand three thousand
no effect were still sinking
the shock wave dissipated before it reached us
well need to detonate one closer next time
the ships hull is under enough pressure already if you detonate a torpedo too close
and if i dont we need to generate a large enough shock wave to push us into a higher orbit to do that the blast has to be big and it has to be close
you heard the subcommander load two this time
sensor resolutions dropping off
this was your plan to grope in the darkness and hope to stumble across my ship
thats how we found it the first time
what was that
weapons fire
where
bearing two nine seven mark two six one down about two kilometres
did it work
weve moved up but only two hundred metres
thats all
a compartment just collapsed deck three green sector
this whole damn ships coming apart how many torpedoes do we have left
six
load two more
it wont be enough
load the weapons
we already tried it didnt work
ensign
shes right well never reach a safe altitude climbing a few hundred metres at a time
the longer we stand around arguing the more ground we lose
fire them all what if we detonated all the torpedoes at once
we may gain enough altitude but i doubt wed make it in one piece
i dont know about you but im willing to take the chance
well detonate at eight hundred metres
i was thinking more like five hundred look i didnt come all this way to get crushed in the atmosphere of some anonymous gas giant loading ports one through six
brace yourselves
torpedoes armed
what is it
another explosion theres a shock wave this time hang on
tpol
what have you been shooting at
we used the shock waves to gain some altitude but its only temporary well start sinking again unless we can come up with a way to get this ship out of here
i brought someone who should be able to help do just that were docking now
i believe youve all met officer bukah whats the status of their engines
the klingon crew made most of the necessary repairs before they were overcome but the port fusion injector is still damaged
i will tend to my own ship
i didnt bring you down here just so you could die with your shipmates my crew risked their lives to get this ship out of danger i dont intend to leave until the job is finished
sir there are two ships approaching at high warp i think theyre klingon
how long till they get here
sixteen minutes were being hailed its the captain
on screen
this is klingon raptor somraw hailing enterprise request permission to disembark four passengers
well i dont see why not
i kept your seat warm for you
thanks get ready to break orbit travis i think weve had about enough of this place
aye captain its the raptor sir theyre hailing us
calling to say thanks
i doubt it put it through
prepare to surrender your vessel
maybe your engineer neglected to tell you but we just saved you and your crew
you violated our ship accessed our weapons
it was either that or stand by and watch you get crushed
disruptors
theyre charging weapons
you wouldnt last ten seconds in a battle with us youve got multiple hull breaches your shields are down and from what im told youre fresh out of torpedoes if i were you id take what little honour i had left and go home fire one shot and ill blast you right back to where we found you
theyre moving off
get us out of here before their friends show up
is someone going to get that
youre closer
tpol
this is doctor phlox youll be happy to know that youre now free of any microbes or parasites your captivity in decon is over
are you sure doctor who knows what was living on that ship
what if we picked up something your scans cant detect
well im quite sure you didnt ive run every possible test
maybe you should run them again doctor i believe im developing a slight headache
of course if you insist i wouldnt want to miss anything
thank you doctor
that should buy us at least another half an hour
oh i could stay in here all day
went to a spa once in mexico the most relaxing place ive ever been but it doesnt compare to this oh it certainly feels nice to be clean again
it is pleasant
do you smell that
i dont smell anything
exactly
the loss to the vulcan people is incalculable pjem was one of our most revered sanctuaries
ambassador we are very sorry for your loss but with all due respect the high command has to take some responsibility you were using the monastery as a surveillance station
we were observing a dangerous and aggressive neighbour the andorians wouldnt have found the station if your people hadnt interfered theyve been in space for six months and theyve already destabilised an entire sector
im afraid i cant agree with that ambassador this was a volatile situation long before starfleet got involved perhaps if youd been a little more open with us this tragedy might have been avoided
we warned you something like this would happen hes too impulsive captain gardner would have made a far more suitable commanding officer
the vulcan consulate doesnt make command assignments here
there was a time when your people sought our guidance i regret that time has passed ive been recalled to vulcan for consultation in the meantime our joint fleet operations have been suspended
yes admiral
get me captain archer
aye sir
i noticed we changed course overnight
i found a new system in the vulcan database coridan theyre only a few light years away so i thought wed take a look
inhabited
just over three billion humanoids apparently the vulcans have a mining agreement with them i had hoshi send a message to their chancellor and she invited us to visit their capital city
then ill start shining my boots
i think ill just take hoshi this time the chancellor asked me to limit the number of people i bring down until they get to know us better
oh
its really too bad according to the database theyve got the largest starship construction yards in the sector theyre supposed to have ships that can run circles around the vulcans
better than six five
they say some coridan ships have reached warp seven but thats just a rumour
warp seven
you should lend hoshi your camera ill be sure she takes lots of pictures
you had me going there for a minute
youre just too easy a target
so youre taking me right
bridge to captain archer
go ahead
im receiving a transmission from starfleet command its admiral forrest sir
was anyone killed
the andorians gave the monks three hours before they started their bombardment fortunately they all got out in time
how are the vulcans taking this
not well
i cant really blame the andorians for reacting this way
jon
if the roles were reversed the vulcans might have done the same thing
the vulcans may have good reason for keeping an eye on them ive seen the reports these andorian commandos are a dangerous group
thats the same crap the vulcans used to say about us
jon youre doing a lot of good work but youve got to be more careful earth cant be getting involved in interspecies conflicts
i understand
im afraid ive got some more bad news
come in have a seat
i just spoke with admiral forrest theres no easy way to say this the andorians destroyed the sanctuary at pjem
were there any survivors
fortunately the monks and the intelligence operatives were given advance warning theyre fine
was there time to remove any of the relics
i dont know the high command believes were to blame for this theyre sending a ship to take you back to vulcan itll be here in two days
i wont have time to complete my scans of this sector ill ask ensign mayweather to finish them
maybe i wasnt clear this isnt a temporary transfer theyre reassigning you
i understand the situation captain im certain the high command will find you a suitable replacement
am i the only one who has a problem with this because you seem perfectly fine
my assignment to the enterprise was only supposed to last eight days it was unrealistic to expect it to continue indefinitely
the high command is looking for a scapegoat someone to blame they cant punish me so theyre taking it out on my science officer sounds like an emotional reaction if you ask me
i am largely responsible for what happened
dont give yourself too much credit i was the one who found pjem in the database and i led the landing party i want you to know im filing a protest with the high command
that wont make any difference
you dont know that
captain i was assigned to enterprise not simply as an observer but to represent the interests of the vulcan people its clear in the eyes of my superiors i havent done that
they have no right to do this to you youre a part of my crew
for another forty eight hours was there anything else
no
this is just another part of the joke right
sorry trip but ive got to take tpol on this one i need to spend some time with her alone
 now i know youre pulling my leg
tpols being transferred a vulcan ships on its way to take her back
what
meet me for lunch ill fill you in
may i i just heard about your transfer im sorry youll be leaving us im sure youll excel at whatever new assignment youre given
i havent received another assignment
i assumed you were being promoted
my superiors believe that im responsible for the destruction of the pjem sanctuary
do you agree with their assessment
its the logical conclusion
im certain the high command would reconsider your transfer if they knew everything youve done for this crew you realise youre not the first vulcan officer to be posted aboard a human starship the high command has tried this before but none of the others lasted more than a few weeks they found their crewmates too chaotic and unpredictable but youve been here more than six months and you havent merely tolerated this crew youve become part of it isnt it logical to take pride in that accomplishment
pride is a human indulgence
i suppose it is oh i have it on good authority that several crewmembers are planning a gathering in your honour i believe its called a goingaway party id keep on alert if i were you
so what do you know about coridan
there are three billion inhabitants mostly concentrated in several cities in the equatorial region
i wasnt asking for the statistics your people have been coming here for decades you must know something about their culture the kinds of food they eat what they do for fun
the vulcan database doesnt contain that information
of course not
i am uncertain why i was chosen for this mission
these people have never seen humans before it makes sense for someone with a familiar face to make the introductions
i have a lot of work to complete before the vulcan ship arrives
dont worry ill get you back in plenty of time i just thought you might enjoy one final mission with your captain or maybe i should just take you back to enterprise
were only a few minutes from the capital returning to the ship now would be a waste of fuel
enterprise to captain archer
go ahead trip
were reading a ship closing on you fast
i got it
some kind of fixed wing aircraft
did the chancellor say anything about sending an escort
i dont think theyre an escort
alien vessel reduce to one quarter power and adjust heading to three one seven mark five
im taking evasive action bring the plasma weapons online
ready
fire
houdini could get out of this
perhaps you should invite him on your next mission
harry houdini was a magician an escape artist he was famous for being able to free himself from any kind of restraint rope chains anything
that seems unlikely
thats why he was called a magician some people say he was doublejointed i dont suppose vulcans are doublejointed
unfortunately not
a vulcan what brings you to coridan
if you want answers talk to me
youre her superior
thats right
i dont recognize your species
im human from the planet earth
never heard of vulcans taking orders from anyone
theres been a misunderstanding were here at the invitation of your chancellor
shes not my chancellor that government is kept in power by the vulcans if youre with them youre on the wrong side
what kind of weapon is this if you wont tell me
its a phase pistol
well put these to good use im curious about your starship what can you tell me about it
our protein resequencer can make chicken sandwiches
stop hes not a tactical officer hes the ships steward were here to prepare a banquet for your chancellor
your people have a reputation for truthfulness you wouldnt be lying to me would you vulcan now i understand youre the captain arent you
perhaps
whoever you are you picked the wrong time for a visit
a steward
we believe your shuttle was forced down by members of a radical faction but since the attack took place outside our sensor grid your officers wont be easy to find
you didnt tell us about any factions
theyre a small group we had no idea they were capable of an attack like this but be assured commander your people are almost certainly still alive
almost certainly
the radicals will want something in exchange for the hostages they always do side arms dicobalt explosives its important that you dont give them anything
is this how you protect your visitors
you might have told us about your little war before you invited us down
were not at war commander this is an isolated incident
i dont care what you call it we just want to know where are people are
we are doing everything in our power to find them
were not going to sit on our hands and wait for a ransom note start scanning for human and vulcan biosigns
there are billions of people down there it could take days
it might be easier to locate the shuttlepod
ill try but if the pods been powered down its almost impossible to pick up its signature
weve got to start somewhere
ready
yes
go
easy
come on go
i think we got a little higher that time
only a few centimetres
thats not frustration i hear in your voice
no
good lets try it again one two three
ready
yes
go
i think these are starting to come loose how about yours
slightly if we can turn around face each other
we might be able to untie these knots youd think the vulcan database might have mentioned these people were fighting a civil war
the database is accurate the coridan government doesnt view this as a civil war
i imagine your people are going to want their database back too well they can have it
can you reach the knot
i believe so without the database you wouldnt have found this planet or pjem
youre not responsible for what happened you didnt have any idea that your people had installed a listening post or that there were andorian commandos there
enterprise had no good reason to visit a vulcan sanctuary i had the opportunity to protest but i chose not to
its clear that living among humans has caused my reasoning to become compromised
i think i understand youre running away because youre afraid to become one of us
i am not running away
then why arent you fighting this transfer
your people took something away from my father that meant a lot to him theyre not going to do the same thing to me
go get his weapon
stop
its definitely a ditanium signature about four kilometres outside the capital
its practically under their noses
from what we can tell the entire capital is surrounded by a shanty town there are almost as many biosigns on the outskirts as there are inside the city
looks like these people have a lot to learn about building a free society have you found human or vulcan biosigns
not yet
what about the pods transponder
they must have switched it off sir ive got a rescue team standing by in the launch bay
hold on malcolm we dont even know if this is our pod i dont want to go down and find its some alien tractor
its our shuttlepod im certain of it all im suggesting is we go down and have a look around
sir were being hailed audio only
who is it
i cant tell
put them through
is this enterprise
yes and you are
were holding your captain and your steward in exchange for their safe return we want forty of your phase weapons the same type we found aboard your shuttle youll be hailed at this time tomorrow
wait let me talk to the captain
im sure you wouldnt want any harm to come to her well rely on your full compliance
hello
theyve cut transmission
were you able to trace it
they were using a triaxilating signal
they called the captain her are we sure theyve got the right hostages
at least it sounds like theyre still alive
for how long we dont have forty phase pistols weve got fifteen and even if we give them to these people theres no guarantee theyll keep their word we know where the shuttle is we have to send a team down now while we still have the element of surprise
were getting another transmission
probably thought of something else they want
its not from the planet its coming from a vulcan ship the nivar
put it up
wheres captain archer
hes not here right now can i help you
inform him that well be arriving within the hour
you guys made great time we werent expecting you until tomorrow
you obviously made an error in your calculations please have subcommander tpol ready to depart when we arrive
weve got a bit of a problem shes not here either she and the captain were on their way to the capital city when they were kidnapped
how convenient
im telling you they were kidnapped
how do you know this
maybe the ransom demand we just received gave us a clue they threatened to kill them both if we didnt give them what they want
it would be irrational to kill the hostages they would lose their negotiating position
maybe were not dealing with the most rational people down there did you consider that
since the situation involves a vulcan officer we will take over the investigation it would be best if you refrained from any foolish endeavours
what the hells that supposed
im getting real sick of being cut off
your vessel is illequipped to mount a rescue mission you would most likely become captives yourselves my team will penetrate their base of operations
what does that mean
sounds to me like youre planning an assault
did it ever occur to you that that could get the captain and tpol killed
weve dealt with this sort of threat in the past swift decisive action is the logical response
youre awfully triggerhappy for someone whos repressed his emotions
theyve threatened the life of a vulcan officer we must discourage any such incidents in the future
this isnt your planet maybe the coridan government has something to say about this
ive already been in contact with the chancellor shes given me full authority to implement this action
you dont really care what happens to them do you you probably wouldnt mind if they got caught in the crossfire youd consider it payback for what happened at pjem
it is not vulcan policy to negotiate with terrorists
not even if it saves lives
any data you may have on the location of your captain and the subcommander would be useful
sorry we dont have anything
warm up the shuttlepod
we cant eat like this
friendly
can you pick up yours
no
dig in subcommander i dont think youll be able to send this back for some plomeek broth
im not hungry
i didnt ask if you were hungry you need to keep up your strength so eat thats an order
look at this
were being hailed its the vulcans
here we go
this is sopek wheres commander tucker
hes unavailable at the moment can i take a message
i want to know where that shuttlepod was going
what shuttlepod is that
the one that left your launch bay nine minutes ago
i really wouldnt know sir we get shuttlepods coming and going all the time its a little like union station around here
i want to know where commander tucker is
im sorry your transmissions breaking up
i guess not everyone gets to live in emerald city
yeah
you should have listened to the vulcan he warned you against doing anything foolish
what the hell are you doing here
looking out for you pink skins if you had gone anywhere near that shuttlepod youd have been killed
they left it in the open for you to find
how do you know what sopek told me that was a secure transmission
sopek is the senior vulcan officer in the sector naturally we keep him under close surveillance weve been monitoring all vulcan transmissions and ship deployments since the incident at pjem we know theyre preparing for a war against us
im no fan of the vulcans but theyre not warmongers
theres already a war going on and the vulcans are in the middle of it several rebel factions here are working to overthrow their government a corrupt government that has very close ties to your peace loving logical friends
so you and the rebels figure you both have a common enemy
the hostagetakers have no plans to return your captain or the female once you deliver the weapons theyll be killed fortunately for you we have a relationship with the downtrodden here
you tried to kill us last time we met why are you trying to help us now
i havent slept well since our encounter at the vulcan sanctuary i dont like being indebted to anyone least of all your captain
youre right you never would have found that spy station without his help
once hes free my debt will be repaid in full show them
your people are being held here these are barracks for the guards
how many
at least four inside the compound two more up on the wall here and two guards outside the gate all armed with particle weapons
howd you get this level of detail
we have an operative inside the compound
unless hes going to take out these guards youre not going to have an easy time getting all the way to the hostages
its not your concern
it is if you get the captain killed youre outnumbered four to one wouldnt you like to improve those odds
they could be useful
give them their weapons
captain can you hear me
trip
its me and malcolm sir were about half a kilometre away
just the two of you
not exactly we met up with some old friends down here andorians apparently one of them thinks he owes you a favour
he couldnt have picked a better time
one of the people guarding you is working with them when he unties you head for the gate its about twenty metres from the building youre in until he shows up just sit tight
that wont be a problem
cold isnt it andorian ale
itll warm you up
whos that
oh its just my friend nothing to
get off me hey let me go
what the hell is going on
get down
vulcans did you know they were planning to do this
youre the ones who have their comm system bugged
our escape plans shot to hell
weve got to get them out of there
good to see you captain
whats going on
vulcans crashed our rescue party
thanks
i believe this is yours its the scanner she gave me from the vulcan listening post
seems you went to a lot of trouble to return it
im here for only one reason i need a good nights sleep my debt is repaid
your presence here is a violation of the tau ceti accords
you lecture us about treaty violations
put down your weapons
i know better than to lower my guard around vulcans
look were all on the same side here
lets get her to the ship
shes no longer your responsibility well treat her on the nivar
shes still my science officer is the pod close
yes sir
lets go
you should be the one dying not her
how is she
her injuries were quite extensive
will she live
i wish i could say
i know how you must feel she saved my life once too she can be a real pain in the ass stubborn arrogant sometimes she makes me angry enough i want to shove her out an airlock i can understand why the high commands upset but it took a lot of courage to step in front of that plasma bullet do you really want to take her back home in disgrace
nothing can excuse what she did at the sanctuary
im not asking anyone to pin a medal on her all im asking is that she be given a second chance if a respected vulcan captain went before the high command and made a plea on tpols behalf told them how she saved the life of a superior officer wouldnt they think twice about this transfer
i cant return without her
shes suffered extreme trauma i wouldnt advise moving her for quite some time
im meeting with the high command in three days perhaps if theres time ill discuss this matter with them
thank you
what happened
whoa whoa whoa you were shot dont you remember
captain sopek
hes all right thanks to you
id like to return to my quarters
im afraid youre going to have to stay here at least another twenty four hours
you made quite an impression on sopek ive got a feeling hes going to talk to the high command about that transfer order id say the odds are pretty good youre going to be with us for a while longer
you should have consulted me first
its probably not too late if you want to catch up to him
that wont be possible leaving sickbay would violate my doctors orders
the captain said theyd be mapping this asteroid field but i cant see head nor tails of them
maybe its another asteroid field
no this is the one two primaries seventeen planetesimals
well they werent expecting us back for three days maybe they finished and went off to do something else
well with our sensor array down we wont know when they get back until we see them any luck with the comm
dead as a doornail i dont understand it
well no doubt youll have your boys take this pod apart piece by piece once its back in the launch bay
id feel a lot more comfortable having everything in working order by the time enterprise gets back
well tinker all you like ive got a copy of ulysses here i doubt ill even be halfway through it by the time the ship gets back
id rather realign every microcircuit on this shuttle than try to wade through that baby
british schools have a core curriculum it serves to provide a wellrounded education sometimes i think you north americans read nothing but comic books and those ridiculous science fiction novels
ill have you know that superman was laced with metaphor subtext layered on subtext
oh if only doctor cochrane had been a european the vulcans would have been far less reticent to help us but no he had to be from montana he probably spent his nights reading about cowboys and indians
well i dont recall any europeans figuring out how to build a warp engine
commander
no brits no italians no serbocroatians
commander i think youd better come and take a look at this
bring us in closer
is it a ship
if the damn sensors were only working we could bring us around again there slow down
come in how are the tesnians doing
dr phlox can only keep twelve of them in the decon chamber at a time
what about the other what is it twenty two
hes rotating them they seem to be doing fine on our atmosphere but they need at least six hours of boron gas a day he says weve got enough to get them home
have you learned their language
yes sir
what do they have to say
theyre pretty rattled most of them have been on that ship for years its a lot to digest they lost everything
theyre alive does the captain have any idea what happened
no and he feels terrible about the damage to enterprise he has no idea what went wrong when they approached our docking port they lost control of their sensor array and then a few seconds later their navigation system went out
thank god their escape pods were working
i saw the wreckage on the asteroid there wasnt much left
archer to mayweather whats our eta
we should reach tesnia in about twenty hours sir
good work that should get us back to our rendezvous coordinates well before trip and malcolm get there lets drop out of warp for a few minutes i want to inspect the damage to the launch doors
aye sir
whos in charge of engineering while trips away
lieutenant hess
tell her to get a team working on a new starboard door for launch bay two
everything else check out all right
astrometrics detected what could be microsingularities in the vicinity of the asteroid field
microsingularities are a vulcan myth theres no scientific evidence that they exist
our deflectors registered some unusual charged particles at the same time the tesnian ship began to malfunction
any similar damage on enterprise
no but our hull plating was polarised
microsingularities if the vulcans had their way theyd blame them for the common cold
how about the lifeboats they could have launched the lifeboats before the crash
theyd be here they only go three hundred kph theyd be right here waiting for us to return
are we sure there are no survivors
commander we have to figure out what were going to do
we cant just leave thats enterprise at least we should find the black boxes
with what we have no radio nothing to pick up the beacons
whats the range in our distress beacon
its offline
im talking about the portable one the one in the away kit
ten million kilometers maybe twenty but i highly doubt thered be a ship anywhere close to that
weve only got ten days worth of breathable air how far to echo three
at impulse a lot more than ten days
well if we could get close enough for it to pick up our distress beacon itd relay the signal back to starfleet
im afraid the math doesnt work out commander its going to take weeks maybe months for our signal to reach echo three by the time starfleet got a ship out here wed be wed be long dead
but at least theyd find us theyd get their shuttlepod back a couple of wellpreserved corpses
sir
which way
which way to what
echo three which way to echo three
i told you its too far
do you know which direction it is or dont you
navigation is down
thats not what i asked you
you want me to guess
you come from a long line of navy men and you got a real good memory look hard at those stars find something that looks familiar and tell me which way to go
sir
thats an order
i dont suppose you have a sextant handy
i left it with my slide rule  well
that blue giant we may have gone by it im not sure
thats good enough for me take one more low pass over the wreckage and then set a course
see you around captain
personal log lieutenant malcolm reed november 9 2151 by the time anyone hears this by anyone i suppose i mean anyone human commander tucker and i will be long dead its my intention to recount the events that led to the destruction of the starship enterprise and to express my deepest feelings regarding my short but memorable service with starfleet
tell them id love to add my two cents but im trying to get a little work done
short but memorable service with starfleet
in order to test the targeting scanners on shuttlepod one commander tucker and i had to get at least twenty thousand kilometres from enterprise during our third trial we experienced a brief but sizable jolt and shortly thereafter realised that our sensor array had gone offline
this sensor array is more than offline its totally fried
that our sensor array had gone offline  we had no choice but to head back to the asteroid field where enterprise was involved in a mapping project we found the ship destroyed its debris strewn across a square kilometre of one of the larger asteroids had our sensors been working we certainly would have done everything possible to determine the cause of the disaster but as it was with only a shortrange distress beacon and limited air we had no alternative but to set a course for echo three where someday this vessel and eventually this log will be found may god have mercy on our souls
why dont you cut the crap and get back here and help me
what would you like me to do
i dont know you could hold this flashlight or turn down the heat whatever you want im just getting a little tired of listening to all your pessimism
if theres something you need me to do i would be more than happy to comply but im afraid pessimism is simply not an accurate description of my log entry im just being realistic commander
weve got nine days were bound to find someone out here
at warp perhaps but at impulse
vulcans klingons suliban xyrillians andorians god knows whos going to be lurking around the next planet we run into
but thats just it sir at impulse were not likely to be running into any planets not for at least six or seven years
then somebody can run into us you ever think of that or see us on their sensors the possibilities are endless
ill heat up some rations unless of course youd rather wait until we run into a vessel serving proper meals
rations will be fine
what are you in the mood for
depends what are you serving
veal marsala chilean sea bass moo goo gai pan
any meat loaf
with gravy and mashed potatoes
perfect
kentucky bourbon
yeah the captain was planning to give that to somebody cant remember who guess its ours now
whats that
the sea bass
any good
its lovely thank you
captain archer claims you told him you werent even aware that i was serving on enterprise i find that difficult to believe considering i wrote you twice in the weeks prior to our departure now it is possible that you never received those letters you were i believe in the process of moving back to malaysia at the time but you must have spoken to aunt sherry during that period and i know she received my letters i would hate to go to my death thinking that either of you felt i was trying to avoid
malcolm youve been at it for hours now dont you think its time to give it a rest
as im sure you must have heard that was my esteemed colleague commander charles tucker mister tucker doesnt share my belief that it is essential to say what must be said to leave a record tie up loose ends mister tucker is labouring under the false hope that we are going to be miraculously rescued before we both suffocate
mister and mrs reed i realise that youve just begun a period of mourning and that ill never get an answer to this question but i got to ask it anyway was malcolm always this cynical
in a few days when the reality of this situation actually begins to sink in you might very well decide you want to record some logs of your own you have my word i will not interrupt you
i just need to get some sleep malcolm is that so hard to understand
we have less than nine days of oxygen left it seems a waste to use it up sleeping
if i dont waste some oxygen sleeping im going to start getting real cranky and you dont want to spend your last nine days cooped up with me when im cranky so turn that thing off and get some rest
were back
lie still lieutenant
what happened how did we
youre a very brave man malcolm commander tuckers going to be fine thanks to you
im afraid i dont understand
get some rest there will be plenty of time to explain what happened in the morning
subcommander
how are you feeling
id feel a lot better if i knew what was going on
captain archer would be quite annoyed with me if i told you of your heroics i believe hes looking forward to doing that himself in the morning
heroics
i had no idea you could be so selfless in the face of such danger most males of your species would have given in to their fear
well since youre obviously not going to tell me what happened i suppose a simple good night will have to do
vulcans can never ignore courage
and this vulcan will never ignore lieutenant malcolm reed again
i cant say ive ever ignored you tpol is it all right if i call you tpol
yes may i call you malcolm
i suppose so but if the truth be known ive never much cared for the name malcolm always seemed a bit too stuffy
i think its a lovely name molkom is the vulcan word for serenity
well then perhaps i wont change it pity though i was rather growing fond of the name stinky i cant believe you just did that
did what
you smiled i saw you smile
vulcans dont smile
this one does i saw you
it was when i said stinky wasnt it you smiled when i said stinky good morning stinky its a lovely day isnt it stinky
whats that
i got the receiver working but the transmitters a lost cause whos stinky
i beg your pardon
you were talking in your sleep you kept calling for some guy named stinky
you repaired the receiver what is that is it a ship
you know the range is very limited its probably just white noise the sound of the galaxy laughing at us
what the hell was that
i dont know but it felt a little like whatever knocked out the sensor array
were losing atmosphere pressures down eight percent
help me weve got to find the hole
without sensors its not going to be easy to locate the breach
then use your ears
pressures down twenty two percent
the damn holes too small
where is it
what are you doing
its nitrogen for the coolant tanks just give me a few seconds
now lets find that leak
i got it its over here
theres another one down here put your finger on it until we can figure out what to do
weve got some valve sealant in storage bin three
have we got anything a little closer
do you mind passing your meat loaf
what
i assume youve finished with it
and you came close to criticising my choice of cuisine obviously whatever hit us went clear through the pod
im afraid it did more than just puncture the cabin commander on its way out it was kind enough to rupture one of the o2 cylinders
great how much closer to oblivion are we
weve got less than two days of air left
the skin of this pod is designed to deflect a meteor five times the size of this hole
in that case id guess it wasnt a meteor i wonder if something like it destroyed enterprise
well never know
always the optimist
we have forty hours of air left what do you expect me to do sit here and plan my wedding
im confident therell be a charles tucker the fourth one day
then maybe its your wedding we should be planning thats assuming we can find you a bride in the next day and a half any suggestions
there was a little bar in mill valley where all the starfleet trainees used to go
the 602 club
you know it
i was there more times than i can remember
i met the girl of my dreams my first friday night there she was the one theres no doubt about it we had it all figured out where wed live how many kids wed have ah ruby whatever happened to you
ruby you dont mean the waitress ruby
you knew ruby
i knew her more times than i can remember
ouch
seems we have more in common than we thought
yeah  would another half day be worth freezing your butt off
what are you talking about
if we lower the thermostat in here to about minusfive centigrade we should be able to use that power to enhance the efficiency of the atmosphere recyclers
our last two and a half days freezing versus our last two days toasty warm what a delightful choice
id pick freezing another half days another half day
freezing it is then
and just what are you doing
an officer at his best is always wellgroomed
nice to see youre developing a more positive attitude
actually i was thinking about what our corpses would look like when theyre eventually found with no air in the pod we should remain in fairly good condition
charming but youre forgetting one thing malcolm
whats that
if i remember my honours biology course correctly your hair and nails keep growing for quite a while after youre dead im pretty sure that includes your beard
thanks
come in
ive analyzed the scans we took of the tesnian ship right before it crashed i believe they were hit by a microsingularity
you still chasing gremlins
this is no myth captain three of the singularities also hit enterprise they collided with our hull plating here here and here
youre telling me these are tiny black holes
they were the dispersal pattern suggests they dissipated on impact this could be a significant discovery captain if we could get quantum sensor readings of the three impact points we could authenticate our findings
id be a little less concerned with winning the nobel prize right now and a little more concerned with trip and malcolm their shuttlepod doesnt have the hull plating we do they could be in for a rough ride when they get back to the asteroid field better hail them agree to a new rendezvous point
i never intended to suggest that our crewmembers were less important than a scientific discovery even one of this historic magnitude
times awasting
my dearest deborah by this time im certain youve learned of the tragedy that befell the starship enterprise youve also undoubtedly learned that my colleague commander charles tucker and i did manage to survive for a few days after the accident its during that brief time that ive chosen to correspond with you although our relationship was shortlived and at times tumultuous i cant help but picture your beautiful smile it gives me great comfort think of me from time to time cordially malcolm
a ship
its a little more modulated than the last one but it could be just a random gammaray burst
my dearest rochelle by this time im certain youve learned of the tragedy
wouldnt it be easier just to record one message and then add the dear whoever afterward this is your fifth or sixth identical letter
thats not true there have been subtle differences i would never refer to rochelle as having a beautiful smile with her it was the eyes
travis and hoshi couldnt have been more than twenty four or twenty five years old
if the captain were here with us now i wonder if hed feel guilty about bringing them on this mission
not for a minute they died doing what they loved
i dont remember hoshi loving much about being in deep space
she was coming along she saved our asses on more than one occasion i plan on letting her family know just how essential she was
sounds to me like you do have some letters to record
ill wait to tell them in person
you know your treacly optimism is beginning to get just a little bit tiresome
unlike your heartfelt letters of farewell to half the girls in san francisco
at least im capable of accepting our fate were going to be dead in about thirty three33 hours whether our beards continue to grow or not is of no concern to me we will be dead and unless some ship happens to cross our path our bearded bodies will be discovered in about three or four years is that optimistic enough for you
whats your problem with having a little hope
whats your problem with facing the truth
youre a regular grim reaper malcolm anyone ever tell you that well if this little trip is a death sentence then it would seem to me were entitled to a last meal whatll it be im afraid our selection is somewhat limited
im not hungry
well then how about a drink
i dont drink on duty
are you serious were dead men remember whats the matter lieutenant are you afraid the autopsy will show your bloodalcohol level was too high to pilot a shuttle 
live a little thats an order
do you really think thats going to provide any heat
the bourbonll provide the heat the candles just for mood to the brave men and women of the starship enterprise
you know thats going to consume oxygen dont you
well probably be dead five or six minutes earlier than we would have been i can live with that anyway it seems to me as far as youre concerned the sooner the better
is that really how you see me the eternal pessimist the grim reaper i dont want to die what makes you think i want to die
because ever since we saw enterprise spread across that asteroid youve done nothing but write your own obituary
i lost nearly everyone i cared about on that ship those girls i talked about rochelle deborah catelin none of them worked out because i could never get very close to them never got very close to my family either for that matter not that its any business of yours but with the crew of the enterprise it was different i was really starting to feel comfortable with them and now the only one thats left thinks im the bloody angel of death
all of a sudden five or six more minutes sounds kind of nice
does that sound modulated enough for you
modulated
the radio or is it just the galaxy giggling at us again
it can giggle all it wants but the galaxys not getting any of our bourbon
you know its funny i was just beginning to think that captain archer was invincible you know just serving on the same starship as him made me feel safe for some reason he had a knack for getting us out of trouble didnt he
yeah hes always been that way when i first taught him to dive it really got on my nerves hed come down to the keys at least once a month and whatever it was i was teaching him hed get it the first time did you ever try clearing your mask
clear my mask
everybodys got to do it before they get certified you go down and the instructor fills your mask with water and you have to clear it by blowing out through your nose nobody likes to do it
the captain
got it the first time filled it with water a second time just so he could clear it again i took him on a night dive once into some caves id been to a hundred times before and for some reason i got a little lost so what does archer do he swims ahead of me and finds a way out
i cant imagine why youd have a problem with that
i was the instructor id been diving all my life then big mister starfleet comes down and does everything faster and better than i could thats when i decided to introduce him to old waldo
and who was that
a green moray its said hes thirty years old mustve been two and a half metres long so i took the captain into waldos hole told him there was some beautiful starfish inside and he reached in damned if old waldo didnt take hold of his forearm
a moray eel are you out of your mind
i was breaking just about every rule in the book but he was wearing titanium mesh i figures the worst thing that could happen would be that waldo would scare him a little he deserved to have the piss taken out of him
so
no such luck he pulled waldo clear out of the hole i dont think id ever seen that eels tail before he found some pressure point under its lower jaw right about here waldo just let go went back down his hole
that must have been the last time the captain ever went diving with you
thats the thing he found it all funnier than i did he took me out to dinner that night steaks lobsters kentucky bourbon
hey what do you think of tpol hmm do you think shes pretty
tpol are you serious
well shes a woman you know i think shes pretty
youve had too much to drink
dont tell me youve never looked at her you know in that way
nah shes a vulcan
well i think shes pretty
oh god
you ever noticed her bum
what
her bum shes got an awfully nice bum
to subcommander tpol
awfully nice
its probably nothing right
its definitely not nothing
well then that means its something what is it well is it something or someone because if its someone
shush
sorry
definitely someone
we have no way to respond do we this is like the plane flying over the desert island in a lostatsea movie
malcolm
sorry happy endings i must think happy endings
shuttlepod one this is enterprise please respond
thats hoshi
transmitting new coordinates
thats impossible
dont be so pessimistic its not impossible its hoshi theyre okay enterprise is okay its hoshi
adjust your heading to the new coordinates we will rendezvous in two days commander and lieutenant please respond
rendezvous what a beautiful word whats wrong
theyre still two days away
and we only have a little more than one days air left
and no way to tell them to get here sooner
are you sure you got the coordinates right
yes not that it matters
lieutenant
theyre probably travelling at what warp two warp three compared to them were like a garden snail where we go and how fast we get there is irrelevant
if i purge the co2 filters itll give us a little more air
how much an hours worth
probably less
great so when they reach us in two days well have been out of air for eleven hours you ever try holding your breath for eleven hours
a train leaves new york at three am heading west while another leaves chicago at four thirty heading east i never could figure those out
enterprise is going to wonder why we havent responded right maybe theyll be concerned and increase their speed
maybe but if we really want to get them to go to high warp were going to have to attract their attention something a little more dramatic than not answering their hails
can they see us on their sensors
two days away at warp three oh they can see us maybe not too clearly but we should be a nice little blip on tpols viewer
then weve got to get that blip to tell them to pick up a little steam what if we fired our weapons
theyre nearly a quarter of a light year away our plasma cannons have a range of less than ten kilometres it would all still look like a single blip its going to take a lot more than that
what if we jettison the impulse drive
what good would that do
well you could rig a selfdestruct i imagine that would make quite an explosion maybe even big enough to make that blip do something odd
no i cant blow up our engine wed be adrift dead in space
whats the difference between that and travelling at a snails pace
im an engineer i wont blow up our only engine
then ill ask you again ever hold your breath for eleven hours
i think i have some microdetonators in here somewhere
how does it feel to be slower than a snail
i saw a great cartoon once there were these two snails sitting on the back of a big old turtle and one snail turns to the other and says hold on fred here we go
if im right i get the rest of the bourbon
fine less than twelve hours you win more than twelve and its mine go check the pressure gauge
you check it i dont think i can move my legs
i cant believe weve been sitting here that long
come on lets hear it how much airs left
ten hours
thats probably the last bet ill ever make and i won i should feel like celebrating shouldnt i
the whiskeys yours now why dont you give us a toast before you drink it
ten hours for two men if there were only one of us hed have twenty hours wouldnt he
great idea why dont you climb up into the airlock and seal yourself in
thats just what i was thinking
any last words you want me to pass along
yeah
tell captain archer that it was one hell of an honour serving with him
what are you doing
we dont know whether or not they saw our little display of pyrotechnics but either way thisll double your chances
youre crazy now get down from there
sit down lieutenant
if anyone should go up in there it should be me youre the chief engineer
im also in charge of deciding whos going into this airlock do i make myself clear
commander
what are you going to do kill me
its set to stun i dont want to use it but i will
put it down
go to hell
stop trying to be a hero it doesnt suit you
what would you know about being a hero it takes nothing but a coward to crawl up inside a hole to die
then go ahead and shoot me but you better hope we dont make it because if we survive the first thing im going to do is bust your ass back to crewman second class for insubordination
be my guest i could use a little less responsibility now get down here
who the hell do you think you are
your armoury officer and perhaps your friend
friends dont shoot each other
you know im not a doctor but im pretty sure you use up a lot more oxygen when you shout like that
so what are you saying that youd rather have enterprise find the two of us dead in here
thats exactly what im saying if theres one chance in a thousand that they saw our impulse drive explode that they increased their speed ill take that chance ive invested far too much time trying to figure you out mister tucker im not about to accept that it was all for nothing
were back how did
easy malcolm you fellows had a nice little bout with hypothermia
the commander
hes going to be fine
it took nearly three hours go get your body temperatures back to normal
you must have seen the explosion
hard to miss you know you guys only had two or three hours of air left
you dont say we saw debris from enterprise on one of the asteroids we assumed we thought you were all
ill tell you all about it in the morning right now the doctor needs to warm you up a few degrees
subcommander
yes
isnt there something youre supposed to say to me
about what
heroics something about heroics
good night lieutenant
trip
mind if i call you trip sleep well my friend
this text book is what you wanted me to see
not exactly
look familiar this was my first astronomy book my father got it for me on my eighth birthday i used to stare at the cover for hours the arachnid nebula whod ever have thought id get to see it in person its less than a light year away well be there in a few hours
from the library of admiral johnny archer
i had high hopes when i was a kid  yes
sir theres a ship approaching at half impulse theyre hailing us
do you know who it is
hoshi says theyre using a vulcan frequency
doesnt look like any vulcan ship ive ever seen
this class of vessel hasnt been used for a long time
theyre hailing us again
is this the earth vessel enterprise
it is im captain jonathan archer
my name is tavin captain of the vahklas its very good to meet you
i get the feeling you werent sent out here by the high command
not quite were a civilian ship
what brings you out this far
i suppose you could say were on a mission of exploration
from what im told vulcans arent that interested in exploring
were not typical vulcans id be happy to explain but first id like to ask a favour
certainly
our propulsion and lifesupport systems are in need of repair wed be grateful for any assistance you could offer
well see what we can do
weve noticed the high command looking over our shoulders on several occasions as well
thats good to know i was starting to think theyd singled us out our chefs had a lot of experience lately preparing vulcan dishes tpol says hes gotten pretty good at it
what is that
oh its called chicken
may i
of course its er meat you know
it looks delicious
so when did you leave vulcan
eight years ago
and in those eight years weve experienced more than most vulcans will in their lifetime
you said you were explorers
yes but its not space were exploring its ourselves
mmm
youre vtosh katur
im sorry
vulcans without logic its a name the elders give to anyone who disagrees with the ancestral teachings but its not entirely accurate we havent abandoned logic weve simply learned to exist without the need to continually repress our emotions its taken years of experimentation but weve managed to find a balance between the two
thats not possible
here we are
logic is an essential part of vulcan existence but it has to complement emotions not exclude them
you must know a great deal about emotion you live on a human starship thats not something that many vulcans would be comfortable with
i am here as an observer
im sorry i didnt mean to offend you
im not capable of feeling offence
my chief engineer tells me your repairs are going to take three or four days we were going to use that time to explore the nebula if you dont mind tagging along
not at all
ive never seen an engine this far gone were going to have to swap out every plasma relay in your reactor
there are a lot of women on your ship
yeah nearly a third of the crew
is it true you mate yearround with any of them you choose
you havent been around humans too much have you
youre the first weve met but ive heard a lot of stories your people indulge their passions do you really eat six meals a day
more like three
and what about sleep i understand you spend more than half the day in bed
eight hours we sleep for eight hours in my case about six when were through here maybe we can get a bite to eat i might be able to clear up some of your misconceptions
id like that commander
call me trip
theyve asked for any medical supplies we can spare and a thousand litres of plasma coolant
well that shouldnt be a problem
tavin has also requested the recipe for chicken marsala
tell him chefs recipes are usually classified but well make an exception in this case i thought youd be spending a little more time getting to know our guests
ive been busy
it seems to me like youve been busy avoiding them i can understand that you might not approve of what theyre trying to do but for all we know theyre onto something
thats unlikely
is it eight years thats a pretty good track record
just because they smile and eat chicken doesnt mean theyve learned to master their emotions
maybe im just relieved to finally meet some vulcans who arent giving me a hard time then again if they have found this balance
theyre not the first ones to attempt this captain others have tried to reintegrate their emotions they all failed what theyre doing is dangerous
unless my instincts are way off they dont seem very dangerous to me but i could be wrong i cant order you to spend time with them but i would encourage you to keep an open mind
so this is the mess hall
it is
the crew must not have much of an appetite
most of them are asleep its quite late
could you show me how to operate this
what would you like
im not sure i dont have much experience with human food whats that
mint tea
thatll be fine
mint tea hot
thank you it has a lot of flavour
you can try something else
no its fine im just surprised do you like the taste
their selection of vulcan beverages is limited
but it can make vulcan tea
yes
interesting
unless you need further assistance
how long have you lived among humans
i spent two years at the vulcan consulate on earth and seven months on enterprise
thats a long time away from home living here has obviously affected you in ways that you dont realise
you may be right on occasion i also drink chamomile tea
and you have a sense of humour a concept that most vulcans cant seem to grasp
youre easily amused
theres that humour again im curious why do you stay here
captain archer needs a science officer
is that the only reason maybe youre more attached to these people than youd care to admit
what makes you say that
your emotions are much closer to the surface than other vulcans theyre easier to read
i have yet to mediate this evening perhaps thats what youre sensing
this may surprise you but we still meditate the balance between emotion and logic requires constant discipline
so youve said you and your colleagues have chosen a reckless path
have we
historys shown that vulcans who attempt to embrace their emotions often revert to their primal nature
thats a myth propaganda from five thousand years ago our primal nature tpol is not as dangerous as you think commander tucker suggests that i try something called pizza would you care to join me
ive already eaten another time perhaps
is it what you imagined sir
pictures dont do it justice
its big over eight billion kilometres in diameter
eight billion are you sure
according to sensors
my astronomy book said it was only six and a half
well have to send our readings to the publisher so they can put out a revised edition
how long would it take to chart that thing
several weeks
my vessel is equipped with translinear sensors we could help you complete the survey a good deal quicker
we should have someone on your ship to monitor the data  would you mind working from there
no
glad you dropped by take us in travis
look at that ive never seen anything so beautiful youd probably consider that an emotional reaction
not necessarily it is aesthetically pleasing
pleasing coming from you thats practically an outburst
its curious that people who reject suraks teachings would display his likeness
we dont reject his teachings we simply disagree with how theyre interpreted have you read his original text he never intended for us to purge our emotions he wanted us to master them and then carefully integrate them into our lives
i doubt many would agree with you
that doesnt mean were wrong
what did you do on vulcan before you left
i taught literature at the shirkar academy
you gave up a great deal to wander the galaxy in a transport
i dont have any regrets i always knew there had to be more to life than just logic and reason havent you ever felt that way
not recently
but you did once
once i should take these readings back to enterprise
tpol you said that you meditated each night tonight dont see what happens i think youll find your dreams will be far more interesting youre a scientist consider it an experiment
whered you hear that
a vulcan anthropologist told me hed seen the ritual during an earth expedition
 theyre not trying to kill the quarterback theyre just trying to keep him from throwing the ball or running with it its only a game not a fight to the death
i see
you must think were a bunch of barbarians
your species does have a reputation but ive always suspected the stories were exaggerated
well i hope youll tell all your friends set the record straight
gladly
theres er something ive always wondered about vulcans maybe you could clear it up for me
please
its kind of personal
go ahead
well ive learned about your marriage customs how your parents arrange the whole thing when youre young stuff like that but what about you know
ah you mean sex
its not a topic ive heard vulcans discuss
well we do have it if thats what youre asking
am i interrupting anything
no please join us mister
reed malcolm reed
kov we were just discussing vulcan mating rituals most of my people are extremely uncomfortable talking about such things so many inhibitions vulcan males are driven to mate once every seven years
seven years
frightening
over the past few years weve been developing methods to accelerate the mating cycle
you up for seconds
ive had enough thank you back to work a pleasure meeting you mister reed
likewise
sir im picking up a transmission from echo three
starfleet
its admiral forrest
ill take it in my ready room
admiral forrest good to see you
you too jon i understand you have guests
a vulcan crew howd you know
i got a call from ambassador soval about an hour ago theyre aware that youve docked with the vahklas and they have a favour to ask
a favour from me
a minister at the high command has a son on that ship an engineer named kov have you met him
i dont think so
well apparently the two of them had a falling out about nine ten years ago his fathers tried to contact him several times since then but kov wont respond
what do they want me to do
i hear these arent your garden variety vulcans can i assume youre on friendly terms
yes
kovs father is dying jon hed like to speak with his son maybe you can encourage him somehow
ill see what i can do
the high command let you keep your science officer it wouldnt hurt to return the favour
understood
keep me posted
our primal nature isnt as dangerous as you think
do you like the taste you must have learned a great deal about emotion
why do you stay here
this is more than a simple headache your blood pressures elevated and im reading unusually high synaptic activity it doesnt appear to be a virus or a bacterial infection id like to run a cranial scan just to be safe
that wont be necessary
itll only take a moment
i believe i can explain my symptoms last night i neglected to meditate before i went to sleep as a result i awoke feeling agitated all i need is an injection of inaprovaline twenty five milligrams should suffice
very well doctor its not like you to stray from your routine this wouldnt have anything to do with our visitors youve been spending quite a bit of time on their ship
ive become acquainted with one of them he suggested that my dreams might be more interesting if i didnt meditate
and
he was wrong they were unsettling it was a foolish thing to do
nothing that a little inaprovaline cant cure i can understand why youd be intrigued by their philosophy maybe you shouldnt be so quick to dismiss it after one bad experience
there are too many risks it would be unwise to continue
youre probably right but if you do decide to experiment further keep in mind that theyve been working at this for a number of years youve only known them for two days go slowly
thank you doctor
come in
captain
please have a seat
the repairs to our propulsion system are going well mister tuckers been very helpful
thats good to hear
is there a problem
i called you here to pass along a message from your father
you spoke with him
actually it came through a vulcan ambassador im sorry to be the one to tell you this but your father is very ill he wants you to contact him as soon as possible if youd like my comm officer can arrange the transmission
its a kind offer but ill deal with this myself thanks for the message
i know its none of my business but do you plan on contacting him
the last time i spoke with my father he said id brought shame to fifteen generations of our family
hes dying kov
if it isnt too much trouble would you please send a message back for me tell him that we said goodbye a long time ago
good morning chamomile
thank you
how did it go
the lateral sensors were out of alignment i havent had a chance to scan the disodium layer
i mean last night did you take my advice
yes
and your dreams
id rather not discuss them
it will get easier tonight will be less disturbing
i plan to resume meditating tonight
you cant give up after one trial
it was a mistake to try in the first place
wasnt there anything enjoyable about the experience
im reading over twenty million cubic metres of disodium as well as traces of ethylchlorate
we can run the scans later tell me about your dreams your emotions were closer to the surface it must have been intense
it involved a memory i was walking down a street in san francisco on earth
why did you leave the compound
i was curious about human recreation i wanted to see it for myself
so you broke protocol
it was late everyone in the compound had gone to sleep i didnt see any harm in leaving for a couple of hours
where did you go
i simply walked then i heard music
music
it was unusual chaotic but i was drawn to it
go on
i went into a restaurant where musicians were playing i sat at a table
how did you feel
i cant remember
try
i felt invigorated
emotion you felt emotion
briefly they finished playing and i returned to the compound
you could feel that way again tpol it isnt difficult and its nothing to be afraid of i can show you how
you want me to talk to him
from what i hear youve become fast friends maybe youll have better luck than i did
well ill try but something tells me it wont be as simple as fixing an engine hes got a lot of resentment
do your best
aye sir
what about this tolaris fellow
well i havent really gotten to know him he seems kind of quiet though a little sullen
tpols been spending a lot of time with him lately
is that a problem
two days ago she couldnt wait to get these people off the ship i practically had to order her to work with him now theyre almost inseparable
if i didnt know better id say you were a little jealous if i was the only human on a ship full of vulcans and we ran into an earth vessel id be spending as much time with them as i could she likes being around her own kind who doesnt
well let me know how it goes with kov
yes sir
mind meld
its an ancient technique it was abandoned centuries ago but weve discovered that it can help us access our emotions
how does it work
id begin by creating a telepathic link we would be able to share our memories our thoughts in essence we would become one mind its quite an experience but it is profoundly intimate are you prepared for that if youd like we could try a more traditional form of guided meditation but it wouldnt be nearly as effective
proceed
its all right close your eyes try to focus on my voice my mind to your mind your thoughts to my thoughts our minds are merging our minds are becoming one
its not working
youre resisting relax my mind to your mind your thoughts to my thoughts our minds are merging our minds are becoming one
am i with you
yes
can you sense my thoughts
yes
youre doing well i want you to think about that night when you left the compound imagine yourself walking down that street
good now listen can you hear the music listen now follow it i can see why you were drawn to this place its unlike anything on vulcan im not surprised
it triggered an emotional response you said you were invigorated what else
i dont know
yes you do youre just not used to describing your emotions you experienced other things excitement about breaking protocol apprehension about getting caught and the music the music made you feel elated allow yourself to feel these emotions again dont hold them back
i have to return to the compound
youre anxious its just another emotion
let me go
stay with me tpol
no
stop
no
stop this was a mistake
youve made progress dont give up now
please go
tpol
leave
youre feeling anger your emotions are breaking the surface embrace them  what a shame
tpol to sickbay
ive already been through this with your captain
are you sure youre making the right decision
if you knew my father youd understand
i dont mean to put too fine a point on this but youve got a limited window of opportunity once it closes
i consider you a friend trip and i appreciate what youre trying to do but please dont i have no intention of contacting him i testfired our port thruster last night its still off by twelve percent
well probably a faulty injector should be easy enough to fix do vulcans dance you know
no only when its part of some tedious ceremony
i remember the first dance i ever went to bayshore elementary panama city florida a girl i had a crush on melissa lyles was going to be there so i spent weeks practicing the twostep with my brother i wanted to make sure i was ready she was wearing a red dress that night prettiest girl there all i wanted to do was ask her to dance with me but i never worked up the courage to go over and talk to her i caught her looking at me a couple times but i ended up just standing in a corner with my buddies
interesting but what does that have to do with our thruster problem
its been more than twenty years and im still kicking myself for not asking that girl to dance you probably dont know this but regret is one of the strongest emotions and one of the saddest i have a feeling you havent had a brush with it yet but it sounds to me like youre pretty close thats something you might want to avoid
come in
good morning
morning can i get you something coffee
no thanks
have a seat trip tells me the repairs to your ship are almost finished you should be on your way pretty soon
yes
hows that survey coming along
well be done this afternoon
thats great news i wanted to thank you for all of your help
it was the least we could do besides weve enjoyed spending our time here you have an exceptional crew captain
starfleets finest sleep well last night
well enough you
tossed and turned always happens whenever were exploring someplace new
i understand well if theres nothing more captain im eager to get back to work we have another twenty million cubic kilometres to chart
sorry to keep you im afraid youll be working alone today
oh
subcommander tpols in sickbay from what the doctor tells me shes in pretty bad shape
thats unfortunate what happened
you know damn well what happened she told me about your what did she call it mindmeld she said when she asked you to stop you got angry she said she had to force you away
what happened between us is personal its not your concern
you assaulted a member of my crew
i did no such thing mindmelds can be emotionally turbulent she simply panicked
panic doesnt land you in sickbay our doctor said she could have suffered neurological damage thanks to you
no one forced her to try the meld she did it willingly
youve been manipulating her ever since you came aboard
i am helping her shed a lifetime of repression and you of all people should understand what im trying to do youre human i need to go see her
tpols had enough of your help stay away from her
she is in a crucial stage of her awakening she needs guidance
i told you its over
i think thats for her to decide
maybe im not making myself clear sickbays offlimits
youre in my way captain youd be wise to let me leave
whats wrong tolaris getting angry i thought you had that under control
move aside
tpols right youve got a temper
now
go to hell
you planned this
if id known i was going to get thrown across the room that hard i might have tried a different approach i think its time you and your friends went on your merry way
keep an eye on the intermix pressure dont let it drift above five thousand
five thousand
and watch those injector ports
i will  i thought youd like to know i got an update on my father apparently his conditions improved
is that so
the surgeons implanted a vasostimulator they say with any luck itll extend his life a few years
im glad to hear it thatll give you a little more time to think about making that call
i already did my fathers the one who gave me the good news thank you trip
anytime
come in
is this a bad time
not at all
feeling any better
has the vulcan ship left
about twenty minutes ago
then yes im feeling better
you do this every night
every night
i think i finally understand why ill see you in the morning
sure sometimes theyre even in colour
is it enjoyable
most nights
i envy you goodnight
we couldnt do this in my ready room
nah the captains got to be in the captains chair tilt your chin up
just take the picture
youve got a stanchion growing out of your head swivel to the right about ten degrees every recruit walking into starfleet command is going to see this on the wall
its a real honour sir seeing those starfleet captains every day gave us something to aspire to
theres a reflection from that status display  could you kill the monitors in the situation room come on tpol the artist in oakland needs a good picture to paint from
do vulcan captains have their portraits hanging at the high command
vulcans are revered for their accomplishments not for the way they look
except for the really important ones who get mummified
why cant they just use a photo from my file
sir im picking up a small planet on our current heading
i thought there werent any systems along this course
its not a system captain its just a planet
put it up
magnify
its a rogue a planet thats broken out of its orbit
lay in a course lets take a closer look
aye sir
captain archer in command
give it a rest trip
this planet supports a diverse animal population
how is that possible
shouldnt the surface be frozen solid
hot gas is vented from the planets interior most of the life forms are concentrated in those areas
oases any people
no evidence of humanoid life
im picking up a power signature near the equator theres a ship down there
try to hail them
no response
maybe they want to be left alone a single ship on a dark planet maybe theyre on their honeymoon
infrareds useless theres too much heat coming from those thermal vents
we should be right over that ship
im scanning for a break in the canopy
if this is anything like the amazon good luck
i used to say i could land a shuttlepod with my eyes closed
well the proofs in the pudding captain
theres a clearing ahead nine hundred metres but its not much bigger than the shuttlepod
it doesnt have to be
captain the vessel is that way six hundred metres
follow me
why dont you let me play captain for a while malcolm this reminds me of the rain forest in new zealand i earned my wilderness merit badge there
you were a boy scout sir
i was an eagle scout
oh so was i
really how many merit badges
twenty eight you
twenty six
oh thats not bad sir
captain
we spot any more creatures like that and well earn our exobiology badges
actually i already have that one
a campsite sir
anyone home were from the starship enterprise is there anyone here
im still not detecting any biosigns but their ships less than two hundred metres in that direction
you and malcolm check it out well stay here in case anyone shows up
did you hear that
yes
anything
for a moment i had a humanoid biosign its gone
its not gone
dhktr siskah tral pkat
nahk itaree
captain are you all right
everythings fine these are the eska
my name is damrus
this is tpol my science officer and lieutenant malcolm reed
pleased to meet you your friends nearly shot me back there
were sorry there are dangerous animals in the forest
weve never seen other humanoids here before
have we trespassed in your territory
this planet is no ones territory but its a special place for us
what are you doing on dakala
were just here to explore wed like to stay for a while if thats all right its a big planet we could find another landing site but i was hoping you might enjoy the company
you arent exactly roughing it
drayjin meat is one of lifes great pleasure
mmm no argument here im curious why our sensors didnt detect you
we use sensing cloaks they keep the wildlife from spotting us
are you studying wildlife here
not exactly
were on an expedition
that drayjin youre eating we killed it yesterday
youre hunters
our people have been coming here for nine generations
to kill the indigenous species
taking wild animals is part of our tradition there are higher primates here we dont touch them
hunting went out of style on earth over a hundred years ago that doesnt mean we dont appreciate your hospitality
that gear you carry seems pretty elaborate to take down a few game animals
dont underestimate the game on this planet they often get the better of us
i wonder if i might join one of your hunts
i thought you people didnt approve
you were able to sneak up on us without being detected by our nightvision sensors id like to see how you did that i promise i wont kill anything sir
its up to our hosts
if the bugs glow in the dark at least you can tell when theyve crawled into your sleeping bag
one more reason i am happy to spend the night in my own bunk anyway its the things you cant see that id be worried about
like those bore worms
bore worms
apparently they crawl into your ear to lay their eggs have a nice night
we can start with the entomologists then bring the other bioscience teams down id recommend we limit the number of crewmen on the surface to six at a time
sensible
enjoying yourselves
very much thanks for sharing your camp with us
were heading out in six hours i suggest you get some sleep if youre still planning to come along
i wouldnt miss it
good night
good night
night i suppose ill turn in then
sounds like a good idea
i think ill sit up for a while
have fun
yeah
jonathan jonathan
hello
is someone there
jonathan
whos there
if the captain says he saw her he saw her
are there any others in your hunting party
no
certainly no human females you sure she wasnt from your vessel
im sure  archer
mayweather here captain there are no other ships on the surface or in orbit
thanks travis archer out
nothing
she was young long blonde hair she was wearing some kind of a nightgown
a nightgown sir
perhaps you were dreaming
it wasnt a dream she said my name she knew who i was and i think i knew her
sir
there was something about her i ive seen her before
on this planet its always night youre surrounded by things you can hear but not see it can stimulate the imagination
you wouldnt be the first person who looked into the jungle and saw something that wasnt there
she was real
captain archer what are the chances youd encounter a halfnaked woman who you think you know dozens of light years from your homeworld go to sleep if youre lucky maybe shell visit you in your dreams
these can detect infrared
among other things
what are you going after today
we saw a pack of fire wolves yesterday about six kilometres from here its a difficult hike
ill try to keep up
wed appreciate it we only have two days left
whats the hurry
to preserve dakala our law states that were allowed to hunt here for four days each year then we have to leave
hunters often wait decades for a chance to come here
are those volcanic vents
yes that areas particularly active mineral springs steam vents its quite spectacular
could be worth checking out while malcolms on his safari
ill get my camera
did you sleep well captain
yes fine
good if you see any beautiful females today youll be sure to let us know
drayjin a female theyre very unpredictable
reminds me of yellowstone
its more like the grottoes of deneva prime im detecting a large geothermal shaft sixty metres in that direction id like to examine it sir
permission granted stay in contact
so she was wearing a nightgown you think shes real
i wasnt hallucinating
captain it doesnt make any sense
i know trip have you ever known me to do anything foolish i mean really foolish
i remember a poker game at jupiter station once other than that
last night i walked into an alien jungle alone chasing a woman who couldnt possibly have been there
that might qualify
it was like i was being drawn to her like i didnt have any control over what i was doing i cant explain it
she must have been some woman
wraith
what is it is there something out there
it could be a plume of steam they can fool our thermal scanners
well lets find out
no point in all of us chasing a sensor ghost you two stay on the trail
damrus
take care of our guest well catch up
jonathan
who are you
how do you know my name
i need you jonathan
youre speaking english
i need you to understand
i know you how is that possible
if you didnt know me would you have come
you said you needed me why
youre different
different
what is it
whats wrong
harm
i dont want to harm you
not jonathan
then who who wants to harm you
captain
are you all right
fine
you disappeared on us what are you doing out here
just taking some scans
hold him
im trying if you cant keep him steady
burzaan youre going to be fine but you have to be still
archer to enterprise
what did that
i didnt see it
go ahead sir
we split off to follow another trail
tell doctor phlox to stand by
yes sir
it was a drayjin the females can be very aggressive especially if theyre protecting a nest
the wounds deep give me the bonding kit
theres no internal damage but hes lost a great deal of blood
weve got a doctor on board our ship ive alerted him to stand by
were prepared to deal with injuries here captain
we need him for the hunt their doctor can help we only have two more days
thank you captain obviously we want him to have the best treatment
lets get him back to the shuttlepod you and malcolm go with him
you should all return to your ship we came to this planet aware of its dangers you didnt
im not ready to leave
lieutenant reed reports theyve docked with enterprise
thanks tpol come in i saw her again near the thermal vents she spoke to me
what did she say
she said she needed me i think someone may be trying to hurt her
i believe you should reconsider returning to enterprise
and have doctor phlox take a look at me there are no psychotropic compounds here
i wasnt hallucinating and i wasnt dreaming
so the only logical conclusion is that she is a real human woman
i dont know what she is i know its not possible for her to be human but shes appearing to me for a reason and im going to figure out what it is
how
im going to find her
ill go with you
no
a wellarmed hunter was nearly killed today it would be foolish to go into the jungle alone
i have to shes chosen to communicate with me i dont know why but i dont think shed reveal herself if anyone else was around
is that your only reason for going by yourself
what
with respect captain i wonder if you would be so determined to find this apparition if it were a scantilyclad man
hows he doing doc
it was a simple matter to synthesise his blood type for a transfusion hell be back on his feet in a few hours
ill let the captain know
commander could you tell me what attacked him
they call it a drayjin it looks like a big nasty pig kind of tastes like one too
i found cellular residue in the wound it clearly doesnt belong to this gentleman i assume it must have come from the animal that mauled him
what am i looking at
the cells are in a state of chromosomal flux theyre mutating its as if theyre trying to change into something but cant quite figure out what that must have been a most unusual pig
hello are you there
im alone
jonathan
youre not a hallucination youre real i can touch you
real yes
but youre not human are you
human
human like me
we are not like you
we there are more of you where i havent seen others
we can become whatever you see a tree an animal water whatever you see
i see a beautiful woman
because you want to see a beautiful woman
how do you know what i want
i can see your thoughts i see what eludes you
youre telepathic thats how you know my language
i know more than your language
then you must know why im so drawn to you why i feel like i know you
you do know me
from where why did you choose me
youre different
you said that before how who am i different from
the others the only ones who have ever come here before you
you mean the eska
do you know why they come
to hunt
to hunt us jonathan we are what they prize above all else
you lost the drayjin but at least you got some scars to show for it
well thanks to your doctor i dont even have that
to the captain and his fine physician
it was no problem really
well we have to drink to something since we came back emptyhanded
to good hunting tomorrow
good hunting
so howd you lose them
drayjin are migratory by the time we got back they moved on
all those imaging sensors and you couldnt see where they went
theyre more elusive than you give them credit for
apparently
do you hunt on your own world
yes
then why travel light years to hunt here seems like a long way to come just to shoot a few wild pigs
we hunt more than wild pigs
the prey here is different
boar wolves some large reptiles it doesnt seem that different
imagine hunting something that can get inside your mind sense your thoughts is that different enough
what are you talking about
wraiths
you mean ghosts
they might as well be
come on fellas that seems pretty farfetched
does it you saw one yourself your mystery woman she was undoubtedly a wraith who wandered too close to camp
but she looked human
you dont even know if it was a she
theyre shapeshifters they can look like anything even people you know
thats how they trick you
they sound like intelligent sentient beings
not the way you or i would measure intelligence its an instinctual response
thats why we were tracking you the day you arrived we thought theyd taken your form
they assume the exact characteristics of whatever they become they turn into a rock all you see is a rock even on scanners
before we learned how to spot them they killed more of us than we did of them my father came here with eight other hunters they drove a group of wraiths into a blind canyon my father was sure that they had them cut off but when they moved in the wraiths were waiting theyd read the hunters minds they knew their plan my father made it out but only two of his friends survived
how do you catch them
in recent years we learned when you corner them they panic especially the young ones
when theyre afraid they emit a chemical signature our scanners have been modified to detect it it gives us an advantage
they know damn well what theyre doing
i find this as distasteful as you do captain im just not sure how we can stop them
theyre well armed and they know the terrain i wouldnt want to try and take their weapons from them
we have no right to in any case
what right do they have to come to this planet and shoot the locals
hunting wild boar is one thing but theyre killing a sentient species
even if we stop them their people will continue to come here and hunt theyve done it for hundreds of years
unless we find a more permanent solution
captain
the hunters said the shapeshifters emit a chemical signature when theyre afraid thats what gives them away you have a sample of their cells
ive been analyzing their mutative ability quite remarkable
can you find a way to mask that chemical that would shield them from the hunters scans
ill start right away
we may not be able to stop them from hunting here but we could level the playing field
evening captain
trip
get you anything
no thanks
milk cold
do you know any poetry
you mean besides there was a young lady from ipswich
when i was a kid if i had trouble sleeping my mother would recite a poem to me there was one i always asked for had a funny name  the song of the wandering aengus i didnt learn till i was older that it was by yeats i went out to the hazel wood because a fire was in my head anyway the man in the poem catches a fish and it turns into a beautiful woman with apple blossoms in her hair she calls his name and then vanishes
and
he spends the rest of his life searching for her his vision of perfection i suppose something he could never quite find its her
captain
when i listened to the poem i must have created an image of that woman in my mind i havent thought about it in years thats why i didnt recognise her at first she isnt someone that i ever knew shes someone i imagined as a child the elusive woman from the poem
why do you think this shapeshifter reached into your mind and picked an image youd almost forgotten
i dont know
maybe that poems been on your mind more than you realise
phlox to captain archer
archer
captain i may have found something
ill be right there she may just be something i envisioned a long time ago but ill be damned if im going to let anyone shoot her
are you sure
its a wraith
im not picking up a signature it was probably just a drayjin
i saw it shift its a wraith
stay with it
where is it
im not picking up anything
it has to be here theres no way out
well if its cornered it must be terrified why cant we detect it
it may not be afraid now but its about to be
im all right
somethings wrong we should have seen it
maybe our scanners arent working
all of them
we need to leave
lets get back to camp
how was the hunt any luck
what are you doing here
we wanted to take a few more scans before we left is everything all right
were fine
you sure you look pretty rattled
our scanners are malfunctioning
sorry to hear it looks like you wont be taking home any trophies this year
strange but we never failed on a hunt before you arrived
i guess we must be bad luck
are you there
yes
theyre gone
for now
did you give the others the masking agent
yes
itll keep you safe
thank you
i know who you are
you remembered
thank you for reminding me
never stop seeking what seems unobtainable goodbye jonathan
dont forget me
i wont

ingala habi
who are you
ingala duk habi
i dont understand
duk habi nakustra
what
bok megoron duk what im saying
sit down
who the hell are you
who we are is unimportant do you command this ship
im the captain
what have you done to my crew
theyre sleeping they wont be harmed as long as you cooperate
what do you want
where is the location of your vault
vault i dont know what youre talking about
maybe the translators malfunctioning
he understands
this is a vessel of exploration not a cargo ship we dont do any commerce whatever it is youre after you wont find it here
you carry no valuables of any kind no precious gems no latinum
i just told you
liar
whoever you are just take what you want and get off of my ship
cousin maybe we should weve made some good acquisitions already
theres more here hes hiding something
i agree with krem lets take what we have and go
what do we have scanners lowgrade weapons
nothing but trinkets
dont forget about the females some of them are worth their weight in latinum if we leave now we can make the next slave market on stameris
slave market
youre right krem pick out the females that will bring the best price
i already have
it was a pleasure doing business with you
wait
youve reconsidered
ill show you where the vault is if you let me keep half the gold
goldpressed latinum
gold bars hundreds of them but i keep half
ten percent
forty
fifteen
thirty five and not a bar less youll never find the vault without my help
twenty percent final offer
no deal id rather you take the women and go
thirtyfive percent thats not a bad offer ulis maybe we should consider it
no well find the vault ourselves krem start loading the merchandise
why am i always stuck doing the menial labour
make him do it
oh not there over here
if youre going to make a habit out of this you might want to get a bigger ship
its not my ship its my cousins
really i was getting the impression you were in charge
this is only my first month on the job
how do you like it so far
my cousins a skillful merchant im learning a lot from him youd better slide that over to make room for the others
what do you need all this for anyway you seem to already have plenty of technology
one can never have too much the rules of acquisition say expand or die
rules of acquisition
thats rule number forty five ive memorised all a hundred and seventy three including the most important one a man is only worth the sum of his possessions
back on my home world that kind of thinking almost destroyed our civilisation
you shouldve managed your businesses better come on we have a lot more moving to do
we
so what do you do split the profits equally between the four of you
oh my cousin determines the shares
you must get a bigger percentage than your crewmates
actually i get the smallest
oh that doesnt seem fair youre the one doing all the work
my cousin knows whats best for me he manages all my financial transactions
really
i dont have the lobes for business
i assume he charges you for his services
of course
he wouldnt be a very good businessman if he didnt never allow family to stand in the way of profit
another one of your rules
number six my cousins going to help me acquire my own ship some day
do you think you could bring me a glass of water
it comes out of a dispenser in the mess hall
ill be right back
oh do you think you could bring me some food while youre at it whatevers left in the serving case that is if you havent already taken everything
you all right captain
never better you
from what i can tell you and i are the only ones on the ship still standing i wouldve tried to wake some of the others but theres nothing left in sickbay to do it with
im not surprised these aliens are taking everything they can get their hands on
who are they
i dont know yet can you get a phase pistol
theyve cleaned out the armoury
there are fourteen weapons lockers on this ship they cant have emptied every one of them
trust me captain ive already checked
ive got an idea but youre going to need some help to pull it off they used a hypospray to wake me up its in launch bay two
this is pretty good
glad youre enjoying it
maybe we should take your cook with us
do you mind
commander
youre going to be fine just because a guys in his underwear you think the worst
i assume you have an explanation
doctor phlox made me clear bioscan after i got back from that lunar survey while i was in decon something knocked out the entire crew aliens are in control of the ship
that artefact you brought back from the lunar surface it must have been placed there intentionally when i opened it the canister released some kind of gas
this female is different from the others what species is she
shes a vulcan
vulcan
theyre really not all that interesting once you get to know them
id like to get to know this one maybe i wont sell her not right away
trust me shes got no sense of humor shes always complaining
krem
you okay
there are times i wish vulcans hadnt learned to repress their violent tendencies
come on weve got work to do
what about the others
i cant wake anybody else up this hypospray is empty lets go unless you want to be sold into slavery
theres nothing here
youre not scanning deep enough this is their vault i saw one just like it on a gavarian ship
why would they keep a vault in the medical bay
rule of acquisition number twenty three nothing is more important than your health except for your money
i dont see a locking mechanism
it must use some sort of magnetic seal ill need microcharges to blow it open
hold on
this is a waste of time weve only got three hours before they begin to wake itll take days to search every hatch
well find it muk be patient open those
empty
ah i found something
gold
no
but it looks like quality merchandise
splendid craftsmanship
add it to the pot
do i look like a menk to you this beautys going in my personal collection
we agreed to split our profits
you said this ship would make us rich well be lucky if we break even
we had a deal
im amending it anything i find i keep
fine ill just deduct it from your share of the gold
whats wrong ulis cant find your pot of gold
whats all this
hey hey hey hey hey dont touch
if youre not going to help us you should return to the ship and what are you doing
looking for the vault
theyre not going to put it on a map you idiot
i know that but look if im not mistaken these are the captains quarters
so
thats where you keep your latinum
whats the quickest route
we could take this elevator to this deck
and cut through here
its worth a look
weapons where is it coming from
over here
make it stop
lets get to their captains quarters
where are my scanners i left them right here
you should be more careful with your acquisitions
oh oh open your bag
no
open it
are you calling me a thief
everybody knows youd steal the wax out of your own mothers ears
please gentlemen were partners
partners dont rob from each other
why would i bother taking some worthless scanners
worthless
i didnt put them there
oh really then who did
i tell you i dont know
maybe they just jumped off the table and crawled inside wheres the other one there were three
dont look at me
give it back
get away
come back here
you heard me you nogood cheating liar
there that one
im surprised your friend didnt get electrocuted you cant just yank out an antimatter injector like it was a light bulb
would you mind
ill have to take the injector assembly offline
warp core parts are in high demand
even if your cousin does find the vault what makes you think hes going to share the gold with you
we have a contract
if you never see the vault youll never know whats in it he could try to cheat you out of your share
he wouldnt cheat me
what happened to never allow family to stand in the way of profit ive seen the way the others treat you one of them said you have no talent for business why not prove them wrong ive got a proposition for you help me capture your associates and ill show you where the vault is well split the gold fiftyfifty once theyre in the brig you can fly off a wealthy man you said youve always dreamed of having your own ship
how do i know you wont doublecross me
youre the one holding the gun think about it no more taking orders getting stuck with the menial work ill even throw in the vulcan female so whatll it be opportunities like this dont come along every day
get back to work
its your loss
where is the vault do you understand me
i cant lock on to its language
its a lower lifeform you fool probably the captains next meal
dont be so sure look at the size of its ears
ooo i could get several bars of latinum for this creature at the malurzian zoo
theres nothing here lets search the other quarters
ive had enough of vault hunting for one day you two have fun
whos there
one of the aliens is awake
why arent you asleep
whats next
where do you expect me to put it theres hardly any room left on your ship i think its time you decided what you really want to keep
ill ask ulis
cant you make a simple decision by yourself if you want to run your own ship someday maybe you should start showing a little initiative
im not the one in charge
and you never will be with that attitude
whos this
my chief engineer
why is he awake
dont ask me
are there others
i havent seen anybody  you
the anaesthesia isnt supposed to wear off for another two hours maybe we used the wrong dosage there could be others awake we should leave
not without the gold
forget the gold well never find it
if you want to leave take one of their shuttlecraft ill be happy to keep your share
you expect me to go emptyhanded
you can keep the shuttlecraft and the females
thats not good enough
itll have to be
youll regret this ulis
get out
grish help me with the women
wait ill show you the vault
trip
leave the women here and ill let you have the gold
not another word commander thats an order
im not letting them take my wife
wife
shes not the one with the pointy ears is she
no her names hoshi and youre going to keep your filthy hands off her do we have a deal
you take them anywhere near that vault and ill throw you in the brig for insubordination
you dont give a damn about this crew all you care about is your precious gold
im warning you trip
youre a greedy son of a bitch
whats your wife worth five bars of gold maybe six let them take hoshi and ill give you ten
what
all right fifteen
enough i accept your offer
youll leave the women
you have my word as a businessman
follow me
wait here ill go
so you can cheat us out of our share hide it in the bottom of your bag i plan to count every bar of that gold myself before it leaves the vault
well count it later
oh i know you too well ulis
if hes going im going
me too
we cant all go times running out someone has to stay and finish loading the ship
thats krems job
im tired of doing this job i dont want to do all the menial work
krem
its time that i showed a little initiative i have the lobes for business you just never give me the chance to prove it
get back to work
yes cousin
you sure told him
get back to work
my back
what about it
i think i pulled a muscle its an old waterpolo injury flares up every now and then i just need to rest
we dont have any time if ulis comes back and were not finished
then youd better get working
where are we going
bottom deck
we already looked there
you obviously didnt look in the right place
after you
have you come to rescue me
how did you wake up
whatever put the others to sleep didnt affect me in the same way my body works differently than the humans
humans
thats the name of their species theyre a terrible race deceitful cruel
then why do you live with them
it wasnt my choice im a captive here theyve enslaved me please take me with you
you would make a handsome wife do you know how to perform oomox
im welltrained in the arts of pleasure but im not familiar with oomox
my lobes stroke my lobes
like this
yes
and this
oh yes
havent we been through this section
not yet
i recognise that conduit
we have a thousand conduits like that on this ship
were going in circles
this way
isnt there a more direct route
thats the beauty of this thing its impossible to find unless you know exactly where youre going
how much further
keep your shirt on its close
watch your head
is this your plan to walk us to death
is this some kind of trick
relax were here
the vault
its all yours
open it open it
better let me go in first
why
knowing captain archer hes probably rigged the place with booby traps just give me a few minutes to check it out
no you could have a weapon hidden in there
ill go
not without me you wont youll fill your pockets with gold
take your hands off me
we dont have all day
get away from that hatch out of my way
thief i want my share
its mine
get back or ill gnaw your hands off
my gold my gold
its a trap
sorry fellas bank must be closed today
did it work
perfectly
do you have the key
not that interesting no sense of humour always complaining
ill make it up to you
how
five bars of gold open these things subcommander thats an order
yeah porthos you okay
im going to be contacting the vulcan high command as well as starfleet if you come within a light year of any one of our ships you wont know what hit you
youll never see us again
if you want to be unshackled you might think about showing krem here a little more respect
vermin
release me and ill forget this ever happened
later maybe if youre nice
let me go you idiot
shut up  are you sure you want to stay here with the humans with my ship and your talents we could build a vast fortune
ill let you have my latinum pen the one youve always had your eye on
no thanks
my beetlesnuff collection
makes me sneeze
name your price
whatever he offers you ill double it
krem were family
i know a bolian female i could introduce you
i thought cajun food was hot
dmarr what do you call that spice
hajjlaran the warlords on preenos use it to test their courage  you sure you wont have some
my courage doesnt need testing
i have other items to trade i can get you some triaxian silk for say another protein resequencer
i bet youd look good in triaxian silk
what we really need are engineering supplies
raw duratanium dilithium ore
im sorry i prefer to deal in more exotic goods but about two days from here theres a small system you might find what youre looking for there
we havent detected any inhabited planets on long range scans
its not inhabited not exactly
what do you mean
mmm this is excellent what is it again
coffee i can have my chef wrap up a few kilograms for you if you wouldnt mind telling us where we can find those supplies
captain please this isnt a matter of negotiation im thinking of your safety
ten kilos
its pure luck that i even found it
found what
a ship crashed on one of the inner planets there were no lifesigns aboard so i landed to claim my rights of salvage
whatd you find
a transport vessel largely intact i could have stripped it bare and made a fortune
why didnt you
the er crew objected
you said there werent any lifesigns aboard
there werent there wasnt anything alive
what are you saying the ship was haunted
the atmosphere is thin but breathable
any biosigns
as the trader said none
ive located the ship sir
lets see it
no power signatures it appears to be deserted
but are your sensors calibrated for ghosts so far dmarrs batting a thousand im reading duratanium beryllium and dilithium
i wonder what caused the crash
theres no way to tell without a closer look
lets get down there
are we sure thats a good idea
youre not afraid its really haunted are you
we dont know what happened to the crew that ship could be a tomb you really think we should be picking through it for spare parts sir
dmarr didnt say anything about bodies captain weve taken more damage out here than we ever expected to theres enough duratanium down there to patch a lot of hull fractures
lets pay her a visit if we feel the spirits dont want us there well leave malcolm you have the bridge
aye sir
travis youre driving
tpol
nothing
according to dmarr engineering should be that way
you and tpol check it out comm us if you find anything we can use or if you see any signs of the crew
aye captain
everything okay travis
yes sir i was just wondering if that trader left in such a hurry whyd he bother to close the hatch behind him
what is it
i heard something
rats maybe
no
well then you probably imagined it
vulcans dont imagine things
its nothing to be ashamed of a spooky ship a missing crew things going bump in the night itd give anybody the creeps
the creeps
yeah willies heebiejeebies what dont you get frightened every once in a while
no
not by anything
no
thats too bad nothing like a good scare
fear is a primitive emotion
theres got to be something that scares you heights spiders
when i was recalled from enterprise by the high command i learned the crew was preparing a goingaway party i found the prospect somewhat frightening
what do you think that trader really saw down here sir
i dont know maybe someone else wanted to salvage this wreck and they were trying to scare him off
that makes sense except scavengers wouldve stripped this ship to the keel
this isnt turning into one of your famous ghost stories is it
would make a good one sir
what do you think computer terminal
yes sir theres no power but the data modules look intact
lets get them back to the ship see if we can find out what happened here
its dilithium all right huh
something wrong
no the crystals are in perfect shape wouldnt be that hard to get this ship flying again
what is it
theres someone here
you said there werent any biosigns
there arent
if youre trying to scare me i appreciate the effort but
tucker to captain archer
go ahead
were not alone down here
were on our way
theres a space behind this bulkhead
why didnt any of this show up on sensors
there appears to be a dampening field in this section of the ship
whats generating it
im reading a power source but i cant pinpoint its location
then lets do some pinpointing
hi
sorry its okay im not going to hurt you
hey tpol
is this your vessel
can you understand me
i can tell youre surprised to see us you probably think were scavengers ill be honest with you that was pretty much the plan but we didnt know there was anyone here believe it or not we thought you were ghosts
we were on our way back from our colony on kotara barath we came under attack as we passed this system
who attacked you
they didnt introduce themselves they just opened fire
were a supply ship we dont carry large weapons we tried to defend ourselves
the captain was able to make a crash landing its a miracle we all survived
didnt you send out a distress call
if we had it would have let the raiders know where we were
so you set up this dampening field to hide
we were afraid theyd come down and finish what they started
how long have you been here
nearly three years
three years youve made quite a home for yourselves here
we didnt have much choice
well you do now our ship is big enough for all of you we can take you home
youre very generous captain but our world is over a year away
well we cant just leave you here
as you say weve made a home for ourselves
what about their engines
their dilithium matrix is stable theyve got plenty of antimatter reserves i think we can get this ship flying
weve tried believe me
we have resources you may not have its worth a shot
thank you captain
oh you startled me thats twice in one day you ever say anything unless youre unable to say anything in which case i apologize
dont touch that the powers been routed to our living area through that relay its very dangerous
im glad you finally decided to speak up thanks
youre welcome
you know a lot about your ships systems
my fathers the engineer he taught me how things work
well stick around then you can warn me about whatever else i need to keep my hands off
hes busy dont bother him liana
its okay i could use the company
my daughter has other responsibilities
these relays are crosscircuited
liana and her father rerouted power where they needed it see here they shunted helm control to airponics
efficient but ill need to reconnect the bridge systems
ill ask liana to give you a hand
thats not necessary
itll go faster
i can take care of it
she knows the ships system inside and out she kept me from getting fried on a live plasma feed
perhaps she can help you then
whats that supposed to mean
by the way you keep talking about her you obviously appreciate her technical expertise
shes very competent
so was the female engineer on the xyrillian ship
youre never going to let that go are you
im simply noting that the last time you found someone this competent you wound up carrying her child
am i interrupting
not at all commander tucker and i were just discussing his previous repair experience
i thought you might like something to eat
no thank you  im going to remove those power shunts on the bridge
are you hungry
thanks
mmm its delicious what is it
its called lorella we grow it in the airponics bay nothingll take root outside
im not surprised its amazing you were able to survive out here why do i feel like its feeding time at the zoo
i didnt mean to be rude
please i wish more women paid that much attention to me
do you know a lot of women
well nearly a third of the crew is female
what about on what did you call your planet
earth ive got lady friends back there but nobody special if thats what you mean not anymore what about your world kantare
what about it
well as soon as we get your engines fixed youll be going back seeing your friends i bet youre looking forward to that
commander i hear youve been making progress
were getting there
there is something else you might be able to help us with
your computer core
it controls all the ships vital functions environmental systems main power you might say it keeps us alive
these are optronic relays
yes and the systems beginning to degrade it could fail at any time
ive worked on something like this on a xyrillian ship
then you can fix it
i can try ill need some diagnostic gear from enterprise why dont you come along  i could buy you lunch
thank you commander but we still have a lot to do here
youve been marooned for three years a change of scenery for an hour or two couldnt hurt
another time
okay ill be back before you know it
why cant i go
you know why
whats wrong with seeing their ship meeting some of their crew
i think youve met enough of their crew already
these are good people they want to help us i promise not to say anything
here
this is where they say their engines were hit
theres a lot of damage
impact damage sir no scorch marks no melting no indications of any weapons fire
maybe they were hit by some kind of weapon were not familiar with
its possible they also say they havent sent out a distress call because itd give away their position
youre not buying that either
they crashed three years ago sir whoever attacked them has to be gone by now why are they still hiding
just because theyre a little skittish doesnt mean theyre up to something
theres also their airponics bay
what about it
its not big enough to feed all the people on that ship sir not by a long shot
how are they surviving down there it doesnt make any sense
do we still have their data module
its in shuttlepod one
have hoshi download it let me know as soon as she has anything
aye sir
how many people are on enterprise
eighty three
all humans
mostly you met tpol shes a vulcan and doctor phlox is from a planet called denobula
can i meet him
are you kidding id never hear the end of it if i didnt introduce you and theres porthos captain archers dog
dog
oh i guess you dont have a word for that hes a mammal four legs big ears kind of cute
what does he do
not much hes the captains pet
of course his pet ive never seen a dog before can we see it
well i hope youll have some time left for me
i dont know it sounds like im going to be very busy
so tell me about kantare
oh its boring i want to hear about the places youve been
our missions really just getting started we havent been to many planets yet
where are you going next
no idea thats the fun part
which planet was your favourite
if i had choose right now id say this one
archer to commander tucker
go ahead
could you come to my ready room
on my way  billy could you continue this ladys tour i still owe you lunch ill meet you in the mess hall
i hear youve been spending a lot of time with liana
did tpol say something sir i swear ive been nothing but a perfect gentleman
im sure you have trip this doesnt have anything to do with that
oh
we were wondering if youd noticed any strange behaviour from her or any of the others
strange behaviour whats going on
hoshi translated the data module we found on their ship and we were able to reconstruct what happened right before they crashed
they already told us what happened
according to this they werent attacked there was an accident on board
what kind of an accident
there are some gaps in the data but it looks like some kind of catastrophic malfunction there was a massive depressurization when the ship went down
maybe that data module was damaged during the crash
its not just the data module
when their story didnt check out the captain asked me to run some detailed scans of the ship according to the oxidation rate in the hull plating that ships been sitting down there a lot longer than three years
it went down nearly twenty two years ago trip
that doesnt make any sense
check the scans yourself
why wouldnt liana have told me
the data also shows that they launched a number of escape pods just before the crash
malcolm found one it was still in orbit were bringing it on board
this is obviously someones final resting place what do you expect to accomplish by opening it
im not quite sure
i dont believe youll be needing my services
its shilat captain i saw him on their ship an hour ago alive
vanilla huh
there are different kinds
oh hundreds i like rocky road
that sounds terrible why do they call it that
i never really thought about it i guess because its got nuts in it its also got marshmallows but i dont think thats got anything to do with the name
marshmallows
theyre little er theyre made of sugar mostly you know im not sure what they are anyway did you enjoy the tour
very much i think sickbay was my favourite doctor phlox let me feed his bat he also asked me to lunch had i known you were going to be gone so long
im sorry something important came up
whats wrong
liana how long have you been on this planet
captain kuulan told you
i want you to tell me
why
because our scans show your ship crashed twenty two years ago
well your scans must be wrong
thats what i told captain archer i said there wasnt any reason for you to lie to us is there  we found one of your escape pods
i think i should go now
liana
take me back
there was a body in it been dead for a long time it was shilat can you explain that to me
i cant
tell me whats going on
im sorry but i cant please take me home
do you need some help
not at all
i thought you were repairing the optronic relays
ive done as much as i can do for now i need to return to enterprise to analyse the data if youll excuse me
do you need some help
i need to contact my ship
because of what you found
i dont understand
you were looking where you shouldnt have
find tpol im going to go talk to the captain
i think it would be better if we stay together sir
you dont have to do this youre not in any danger here
thatd be easier to believe if you werent hiding things from us
cant you just fix our systems and go
is that what you really want how old were you when your ship crashed five six do you even remember what your home looks like
this is my home
liana
i didnt tell them anything
no she didnt but if you want any more help from us were going to need some answers
we dont owe you answers
take their weapons
please just let them leave thats what you wanted in the first place
when the repairs are completed
make him stop hell listen to you
go back to your ship
not without my officers
this isnt a negotiation
liana
get to work
wheres tpol
dont worry about her
im going to need her help
you can do it on your own
im not doing a thing until i see her
do as i say or youll never see her
whats so important about this thing youd really kill us to keep it running
you wouldnt understand
i dont care what your big secret is it doesnt matter if youve been here three years or thirty but youve got to think about liana we can help you take her home
just fix those relays
you got a lot to learn about making friends
ive made all the friends i need
im sick of hearing that hes doing this for me i dont believe it anymore
i wouldnt be alive if it wasnt for your father
he still should have told them the truth
you know he cant do that
he can do whatever he wants hes not like you
you shouldnt have gone to their ship
you think this is my fault
i saw the way you looked at their engineer are you sure you didnt say anything
no i didnt
theyll be gone soon and everything will be fine again
well set the shuttle down in the foothills south of their ship
wont they pick us up on sensors
their dampening field should leave them as blind as we are
unfortunately that rules out using the transporter as well
well go in through their escape pod ports that should put us near engineering and their computer room
and with a bit of luck near tpol and commander tucker
thats a pretty neat trick here you are watching me with a gun in your hand while at the same time your corpse is up on the enterprise what do you do for an encore
would you wait outside
im not supposed to leave him
its all right
they do what i ask them to
then why dont you ask them to let me go
i wish i could
maybe you could tell me how im being guarded by a dead man
do you think its possible to tell a lie so many times that you begin to believe its the truth you can i never really understood that until you came remember when you said you thought we were ghosts in a way you were right
work your way down the port side comm us if you find tpol and be careful
aye sir
thats why your father needs to keep this running
yes
you can stop this
you all right
yeah where did he come from
good question
you have to get them off the ship
liana please if you dont my friends could die please
what happened to your crew
theyre gone captain isnt it obvious
your real crew
oh they didnt seem real to you i created them wasnt easy took time you could touch them they could make you laugh surprise you
they were holograms
they were our friends our family for over twenty years
theyre the only people ive ever known besides my father until youve came
but the ones you based them on the crew of this ship where are they
i buried them out in the hills the ones i could find after the crash i killed them so i buried them
that isnt true
you dont remember you were a child we were on our way home just like kuulan told you but we werent attacked there was an ion storm it overloaded our plasma conduits i was the chief engineer it was my responsibility to start repairs but it was worse than i thought leaking plasma burned through the hull we were losing atmosphere so captain kuulan set a course for this planet
sounds like you did everything you could to save the ship
theyre all dead apparently i didnt do enough
they died because of me
no it was my decision she was in our quarters on the lowest deck i knew shed never survive a crash landing down there so i went to get her
any father would have done the same thing
i left my station the plasma leak grew there was an explosion half the crew died instantly including my wife a few made it to the escape pods but
i cant imagine what making that decision must have been like but it was a long time ago you need to consider your daughter now
why do you think i did this to retreat into some fantasy pretend it never happened for two years i tried to repair our ship and i watched my daughter grow up alone so i decided to bring them back her mother first then captain kuulan and the others i did everything i could to make it like it was for her
she deserves more
ive given her everything she needs
and when youre gone
trip please
are you going to let her bury you out in the hills and live the rest of her life with these people you created what if the relays burn out again then shell really be alone
shes my daughter its not your concern
what if she gets hurt what do you do then programme a holographic doctor
weve survived here successfully
maybe you have ask liana how she feels ask her if just surviving is enough
you all right well finish working on your holographic systems if thats what you want but you should be sure thats all the help you need from us it may be a long time before anyone comes by here again
come in  welcome aboard
thank you captain you have a beautiful ship
thanks were pretty proud of her
may i sit
of course
i havent been in space for a long time it feels strange good just a bit strange
can i get you something some tea
im fine no im not your engineer is a very plainspoken man
thats one way of putting it
ive never kept secrets from my daughter she knows theres more to see beyond our little oasis but shes never talked about leaving not once now your engineer thinks we should just pack up and go twenty two years captain ive lived here for twenty two years and that ship down there may seem like nothing more than spare parts to you but to me its home i dont want to leave i am happy here comfortable but mister tucker wants me to believe that im being selfish he says that now that i have the opportunity to leave i should that liana deserves more maybe its time i stopped being so afraid of change will you help me take my daughter home
well stay as long as it takes to get your ship flying
thank you captain but all we need are these components ive got my own crew to do the work some of them are pretty fair engineers i saw to that
hows it going
good were about to start realigning the antimatter injectors
that was fast
whats that
its a protein resequencer i figured you must be tired of eating the same food all the time i programmed it for making icecream only five flavours but theyre good ones
rocky road
you didnt think id send you off without rocky road
thank you
are you sure you dont want us to stay for a while lend a hand
youve got a lot more places to go
so do you
maybe ill see you out there
id like that
captain sir
how many
i saw at least thirty this place is pretty big there could be more
any idea who attacked the shuttle
i didnt exactly have time to get a good look
the energy readings we got from the other side of that moon could have come from a helix
theres a wall about five metres high its looks like it surrounds this entire building i see something that might be a guard tower but i cant be sure
any people
no sir
you up for another walk
youre the new arrivals
why are we here
why are any of us here
follow me
thank you major please sit down
i can understand why youre upset no doubt youve had a difficult afternoon
to say the least
i meant to speak to you earlier but i had some urgent business to attend to i apologise we dont see many starship captains here  jonathan archer
thats right
you must be travis mayweather
and you are
i am colonel grat
i take it youre the man in charge
i took the liberty to examine the database in your shuttlecraft so i know that youre from a planet called earth and that you serve on a vessel called enterprise what i dont know is what you were doing within our military zone
military zone
you entered orbit of our second moon you must have detected it
we picked up some unusual energy readings but we had no idea where they were coming from we were simply curious
your curiosity almost got you killed fortunately our patrol ship didnt vaporise your shuttlecraft
you might think about putting up a no trespassing sign
ill pass that along
where are we now
this is a detention complex its several light years from where we found you
does everyone that violates your territory get thrown into a place like this
were at war with a species that can mimic the appearance of almost any humanoid we had to make certain that you werent infiltrators
if youre worried were suliban trust me were not
i know weve already tested your dna youre familiar with the cabal
unfortunately
then you must know about their genetic enhancements and how dangerous they can be
firsthand
i hope you didnt suffer too many casualties
weve been lucky so far were eager to get back to enterprise if youll take us to our shuttlepod well be on our way
im afraid i dont have the authority to release you we have very strict regulations youll have to appear before a magistrate on tandar prime but the hearing should be brief ill explain that this was just an innocent misunderstanding
whens this hearing
a transport will be here in three days
three days
i wish i could offer you more comfortable accommodations unfortunately this detention complex is overcrowded at the moment i would advise you to keep to yourselves if the suliban give you any trouble simply tell one of the guards
id like to contact my ship let them know were all right
i cant permit that captain
regulations
but i will call them personally and explain the situation
escort these gentlemen back to their quarters make sure they get a proper meal im sorry we couldnt have met under better circumstances
so am i
they call this a proper meal i should save it for commander tucker itd make a good valve sealant
why dont you get some sleep ill take the first watch
this thing doesnt hold much
ill be right back
how about waiting your turn
i cant believe youd do this to a child
do what
shes a little young to be a member of the cabal
you dont know what youre talking about
i know that youre given genetic tricks as payment what are they giving her
i dont know who you are but youre wrong about us
is that so
were not genetically enhanced and were not members of the cabal
if thats true then what are you doing here
didnt colonel grat tell you were dangerous all suliban are dangerous
its past curfew
we were just on our way back
sorry danik its the second time this week
klev please
its only for one night
its my fault im the one who kept them here
get back to your cell
where are you taking him
isolation unless you want to join him do as i say
will you make sure she gets back  ill see you in the morning  dont worry
id like to speak with them
im sorry but regulations forbid that theres nothing to be concerned about theyve been placed in comfortable quarters and theyre perfectly safe
if its all the same to you id rather hear that from the captain
im afraid thats not possible
may we attend the hearing
of course
will they be given legal representation
theyre also free to choose their own counsel when you arrive at tandar prime youll be contacted by the central magistrates office
well need the coordinates
im sending them now
thank you colonel
good luck to you
hoshi
i cant trace the signal he must have scrambled the carrier wave
keep at it
what are you suggesting we do mount a rescue
the thought crossed my mind
it would be a mistake to provoke the tandarans any further
so we just sit on our hands
the hearings in three days
and what if theyre found guilty sentenced to thirty years in prison
thats unlikely if you want to explore alien cultures youll need to learn to respect their laws if captain archer were here im sure hed agree if youd like ill contact the vulcan high command they might be willing to send an arbitrator
a vulcan lawyer theyd be better off getting the electric chair
electric chair
never mind
set a course for tandar prime
hello again  i hope isolation wasnt too rough
it gets very cold in there at night sometimes i wish i was genetically enhanced if youve come to apologize dont it was just a misunderstanding
actually i was hoping to find out whats going on around here
maybe you should talk to one of the tandarans
i spoke to colonel grat but i get the feeling hes not telling me the whole story archer my name is jonathan archer
more
ive had plenty thank you it was very good
you look like tandarans
why dont you go and find your friends and dont forget curfew
i wont
were not criminals captain and were not soldiers the only thing were guilty of is being suliban
they must have tested your dna figured out that you havent been genetically altered
as far as theyre concerned that doesnt mean anything you believed i was a member of the cabal didnt you didnt you
yes i did
all that seems to matter is the way we look be careful of their wicked smiles their shining yellow eyes at night theyll squeeze right through your door and everybody dies the tandaran children used to tease my daughter with that nursery rhyme at least here she doesnt have to hear it anymore
this is an internment camp
detention complex twenty six ive heard its one of their nicer ones
why did this happen
the cabal began their attacks eight years ago it wasnt long before the tandarans started to question the loyalty of all suliban living in their territory we were rounded up relocated as they like to say they told us it was only temporary it was for our own safety once the cabal has been destroyed you will be free to go back to your homes were still waiting there are eighty nine of us here thousands more in other camps everyone of us used to be citizens on worlds in the tandar sector did you know that i was born in the same town as one of the guards major klev i was friends with his brother when we were growing up
what about the government on the suliban homeworld dont they have something to say about this
im sure they would if they still existed our homeworld became uninhabitable three hundred years ago most suliban are nomadic but some of us have assimilated into other cultures my grandfather made the unfortunate decision to settle on tandar prime
what are they doing here
its all right i asked them
this came today  what species are you
were human
never heard of them
sajen youre being rude
bad news
its my wife we were separated during the relocation shes in one of the other camps her transfer was rejected again she tried to appeal their decision but as usual they wouldnt listen
im sorry
midday inspection try to look your best
thank you for lunch
thank you for listening
why did you bring them here
maybe i was tired of talking to you
they could be working with grat
hey
colonel grat wants to see you
just him
i understand you were out after curfew last night arguing with a suliban
it was just a misunderstanding
you should have my advice captain
i know i know its a big problem with me im just too damn curious whenever i meet new people i cant resist trying to get to know them im certainly getting to know a lot about the suliban around here
i admire your spirit of exploration but in this case it could get you into trouble keep to yourself
ill do my best unless you have any more advice
no but i do have a question have you ever been to oklahoma i guess you could say im a curious man myself after you mentioned that you were familiar with the cabal i decided to speak with our intelligence agency theyve uncovered some interesting facts apparently two suliban soldiers crashlanded near a town called broken bow oklahoma they were chasing a klingon of all things i was wondering if you could provide some insight into what they were doing there
i wouldnt know youd have to talk to my superiors
oh i think you know a great deal enterprise took the klingon back to his homeworld isnt that right rigel ten you made a detour there from what im told you contacted a woman named sarin you remember her well ill remind you she was the head of a suliban resistance cell she was killed by the cabal in a firefight at the trade complex several of our people saw you there captain i believe you were injured a shot in the leg do i have to ask your superiors about that as well
what exactly do you want
information what do you know about the cabal what genetic enhancements youve seen helix deployments whos giving them their orders
youve got plenty of suliban here why not ask them
we both know they wouldnt be very helpful
then why are they in prison
thats a discussion for another time
there are families here children one man hasnt seen his wife in years
tell me what you know
they dont deserve this kind of treatment
theyre here for their own protection
oh really
the last thing we wanted to do was build these detention centres but we had no choice when the cabal began their activities there was a great deal of fear among the tandarans there were instances of violence fourteen innocent suliban were killed in one day alone we had to find a way to keep them out of danger
then why not just let them find another place to live
they wouldnt get very far its ironic but once theyre out of tandaran territory the cabal will hunt them down and turn them all into soldiers theyre better off here
ive met a few suliban who disagree
one of the cabal leaders is a man named silik he infiltrated your vessel approximately three months ago posing as a borothan pilgrim what did he want did he speak of the temporal cold war answer me
this conversation is taking longer than i expected id hate to see you miss that transport tomorrow morning the next one wont arrive for another sixty days
im afraid the hearings been postponed
why
the magistrate assigned to their case is in the middle of a very complex proceeding and its taking more time than he expected
how much longer are they going to have to wait
hopefully not more than a few days if you stay on course for tandar prime ill arrange for an ambassador to show you our capital city when you arrive
were not interested in a tour we just want our people back
im doing everything i can try to be patient youll hear from me soon
ive isolated their carrier frequency do you see it
im tracing it now bearing one seven eight mark twelve
how far
five point two light years
all im saying is we go take a look for ourselves make sure theyre okay
proceed
most of the people we meet have been pretty eager to get to know us but weve had our share of unfortunate encounters i guess you could say this is one of them
ive lived with tandarans all my life theyre decent people for the most part
what about you what did you do before you ended up here
i was director of research at an engineering institute its in the querella province you should see it assuming your hearing goes well
ive got a feeling we could be here for awhile
why not tell grat what you know get yourself out of here
i dont like being strongarmed and i dont like what hes doing to you and the others has anyone every tried to get out of here
you mean escape a couple of years ago three men pried open one of the security grates they tried to get to the docking bay
docking bay
yes its about a hundred metres away its where they keep suliban ships theyve impounded
what happened
oh they managed to get inside but before they could reach a vessel all three of them were killed colonel grat made a ridiculous claim that they were armed
they might have succeeded with a little help from the outside it wont be long before enterprise comes looking for mayweather and me
i appreciate the offer captain but i doubt many people here would be willing to take the risk
have you asked them how many ships are in that docking bay
writing a letter
its a journal
could be valuable someday people will want to know what happened here
i doubt anyone will ever read this
then why are you writing it
why do you care i see how you look at us suliban terrify you you wouldnt be surprised if i slithered up this wall or turned my face inside out cabal suliban its all the same to you
thats not true
what took you so long
are you all right
more or less
were picking up
suliban biosigns
its not what you think are you sure this is a secure frequency
im triaxilating the signal sir if we were in the middle of starfleet headquarters no one would pick it up
good where are you
in orbit it wont be long before were detected
im getting a transporter lock on you now captain
just say the word and well bring you both home
hang on trip were not ready to leave just yet
those suliban you detected are prisoners too but theyre no more guilty than we are
i want to help them get out of here
captain
have you ever heard of manzanar subcommander
im not familiar with that planet
its not a planet it was an internment camp
on earth during the second world war japaneseamerican citizens were imprisoned there even though they didnt do anything wrong the same things happening here
i thought you decided not to interfere with other cultures
in this case im making an exception
understood
yes captain
ive met a suliban who knows this camp inside and out weve been working on a plan but were going to need your help
well need a few of your people anyone whos had experience with particle weapons
we wont make it ten metres outside the complex before were shot like the others
and even if we did get to the ships and managed to lift off there are patrol vessels in the area
enterprise can handle them
and once weve made this miraculous escape where do you expect us to go
all we have to do is get out of tandaran territory after that we can set a course for the niburon colonies i know some people there they might be willing to help us
its too dangerous
would you rather spend the rest of your life in prison
youre placing a lot of trust in people youve only known for three days for all we know theyve been planted here to stage this revolt so grat would finally have a reason to kill all of us
were not working for the tandarans
think of your daughter are you willing to risk her life too
were getting out of here sajen
im not going to help you plan our suicide
i hope the others were more enthusiastic
this is the wall that i was telling you about its only forty metres from the docking bay
have you had a chance to reconsider im willing to compromise captain just tell me what you know about silik
well hes about this tall a little on the scrawny side bad teeth
if youre unwilling to discuss the suliban maybe you can help me with something else we detected some unusual energy readings last night at first we thought it was random interference but after examining the readings more closely we discovered they were coming from your quarters
you should check your sensors theyre obviously malfunctioning
im told theyre working perfectly
sorry captain
we found this in ensign mayweathers pocket but he wouldnt say how it got there  i was hoping you could tell me  take him to isolation
if i come in low from the east i should be able to evade their proximity sensors
this appears to be a pulse cannon
itll be my first target
bridge to sickbay
phlox here
whats your status
finishing as we speak though im not completely happy with the nose
its almost time
understood
its captain archer
put him through go ahead captain
you seem to be offcourse i thought you were headed for tandar prime what brings you here
wheres captain archer
if youre thinking about trying to circumvent our legal system i advise against it
you come any closer to our planet and my patrol ships will open fire
what happened to you
what do you care
daniks been looking for your captain have you seen him
you might try isolation still think were working with the tandarans you know we could have left this place a long time ago if we hadnt decided to help you
i never asked for your help
why because were not suliban because we look a little too much like tandarans ill admit when i first came here it wasnt easy to see past my preconceptions about the suliban but i did why cant you
were being hailed its him
check your sensors and youll see two patrol ships headed toward you
we didnt come here to fight we came to talk with you
theyll have a weapons lock on your vessel in less than one minute
do you eat meat colonel
what
our chef is preparing a meal in your honour and i was curious whether youre vegetarian i was hoping youd join me for dinner it would give us an opportunity to get acquainted
you have forty five seconds to leave orbit
i cant believe youre really going to destroy our vessel over a trivial incident like this i can tell youre an enlightened man all im asking for is a chance to show you that were enlightened as well were transmitting a copy of earths historical database along with the starfleet charter and a record of all human contacts with alien species if you have any doubts about our intentions this material should lay them to rest send him the vulcan database as well i think youll find that my people have a great deal in common with you too
youre jamming our frequencies break off your transmission now
what about dinner should i set a
im not going to warn you again end your transmission and leave orbit
mister tucker
its done
those patrol ships are closing fast
get us out of here
yes
i understand youre looking for a way out of here
who are you
dont you recognise me travis
malcolm
in the flesh oh you look worse than i do what happened
long story howd you get down here
transporter i think im finally getting used to it
are you sure you werent detected
no thanks to hoshi she kept the sensors occupied
congratulations ensign your case is about to be dismissed
the isolation block is here hes in one of these cells
ill find him
the charges
theyre in place are you up for this
nightly inspection
i thought you said it wasnt for another fifteen minutes
id better get back see you in orbit
good luck
reed to enterprise
go ahead
the guards are ahead of schedule
whats your status
were two hundred thousand kilometres away
were going to need you to speed things up a little
well do our best
here they come
polarise the hull plating stand by weapons
aft torpedoes fire
two direct hits theyre veering off
take us down
did they follow us
they took heavy damage theyre both attempting to land
youre clear to launch commander
acknowledged
go ahead
hes approaching the compound two minutes
tell him
get out there
if this happens again youll all be spending time in isolation
major do you have a second i dont mean to cause any trouble but i was wondering if it might be possible to get some better food no offence but the meals here are pretty awful
eat what youre given
ill try but im not sure i can hold down another bowl of that what do you call it it tastes like sawdust is that what they make you eat because if it is id think about going on a hunger strike i dont know how you
enough
go go
reed to tucker the walls down
i see it stand by
hurry go with the others
hurry hurry go go hurry
father
ill be there soon narra go go
its good to see you malcolm
howd you know it was me
you have no idea what youve done you havent freed these people youve condemned them
my fathers back at the common area he needs help please
ill go
no wait
come on
you had no right to interfere
this isnt about my rights its about theirs
they have no rights they lost them the moment the cabal began attacking us do you know how many people the cabal have murdered how many ships they destroyed colonies you just gave them eighty nine new soldiers
what makes you think theyll join the cabal
these people have nothing left theyre desperate theyll never be able to resist what the cabal has to offer
i havent been here very long but i seem to know these people a hell of a lot better than you do
archer to enterprise
go ahead captain
were on our way
where are those patrol ships
they wont pose a threat
and the suliban
their vessels are breaking orbit
good work
well see you in a few minutes
tell the doctor to meet us in sickbay my skin is really starting to itch
ill let him know
captain think theyll make it
do i think theyll get out of tandaran space safely yes do i think theyll be all right
did you get that
tostka insult some kind of an insult
hes insulting us or we insulted them
im not sure
tostka
ask what we did wrong
kjass skjask las
hwajat ajhakjahs
well
you eat like you mate
you sure that things working
sasooratt
i think they want to leave
that much is obvious
whatever weve done to offend you i apologize
jhaaratun yiitooratt loorii
sasooratt
well this is one for the books briefest first contact
does anybody hear that
what the static
frequency distortions mixed in with the static
youve got better ears than we do
its coming from the comm system
have you run a diagnostic
twice i guess today is just not my day
hows the translation coming along
slowly hwajat their word for eat
what about it
with the emphasis on the first syllable hwajat it means to mate
i can see how that might cause some confusion over dinner
context is critical in every language but kreetassan has the most subtle variations ive ever seen the same word can have a dozen different meanings
we rely on you to recognise the difference ensign
you think it was my fault
i didnt say that
you implied it
i simply noted that linguistic matters fall within your responsibility for all we know it was mister tuckers table manners that offended them
but you think if i picked up the language faster they might have not stormed off the ship
theres no need to react emotionally try to learn from failure it could help your next first contact be more successful
thanks
commander im picking up some kind of interference from the comm system a highfrequency distortion
is it a problem
mostly just irritating
ill track it down first thing in the morning
thanks
is he in there
yes
hows his mood
now might not be the best time
ill take my chances
it better be important
prime rib tonight with real horseradish
thanks ill have the steward send some up thought wed set a course for this brown dwarf system looks interesting
i cant wait in the meantime why dont we shoot a little nine ball you can break
maybe later
i was going to save this for a rainy day but
stanford versus texas
the finals
fresh out of the subspace mailbag youve been threatening to teach me the finer points of the game
unless youre too busy with your brown dwarves
what if they just dont like being touched remember how uncomfortable they looked when the captain tried to shake their hands
they looked that way the entire time besides they didnt really lose their temper until they arrived here in the mess hall
are you staying for the movie tonight
whats playing
wages of fear classic french film no youll like it things blow up
oh sounds fun hoshi
no thanks im turning in early
we might need a translator those subtitles go by pretty fast
ive had enough language problems for one day
were going to have to sit in the back
one minute
i hate missing the beginning
its on the computer you can watch it whenever you want
its not the same you dont want to go back and see the first part after you know how it ends
the power just went out on d deck cargo bay two the lighting grids down
its probably just a blown relay leave it for the night shift
if its just a blown relay itll take you ten minutes to fix here
the comms out too
two and a half hours
two hours and twenty four minutes
seems awfully long for a movie about four men in a truck
youll be on the edge of your seat
you promised me explosions
dont worry
this is all wrong  excuse me reed to bridge
go ahead lieutenant
were trying to watch a movie down here but instead were being treated to a view of you so unless youre planning on giving us a little song and dance maybe you could see whats gone wrong
come on come on goal for stanford
how deeps the pool
deep enough so that no one can touch the bottom
i didnt know it was such a rough game
think of it as one part basketball one part swimming and one part wrestling
and i thought it was just a bunch of guys screwing around in a pool
engineering  michael is that you hello
nice goal
did you see the way number twelve set him up wait hes called the point man right
very good i told you best sport in the world
well ill still take a great offtackle run out of the backfield but i can see how you can get hooked on this
thanks for thinking of it
my pleasure now keep watching while texas trounces your sorry california butts
you havent watched the end of this have you
of course not
hello
what the hell was that
oh number eight on texas just fouled one of my boys hes going to be ejected for twenty seconds
is that fair it gives you guys an advantage
well thats the point i dont suppose itd be practical to put a pool on the ship
i wouldnt want to be taking a swim if the gravity plating went offline
no no
kelly to the captain
go ahead
sir im in cargo bay two and
theres some kind of lifeform in here
lifeform
its got rostov sir hes still conscious but he cant
crewman
weapons to stun
captain
sir
careful
the light
shes alive
captain leave
crewman
leave
captain
get out of here go
this thing appears to be growing theres no telling if itll get out of the cargo bay i recommend we evacuate the entire deck
how did it get onboard
the last time we opened the airlock we were docked with the kreetassans
you think they left us a little souvenir
our encounter didnt go well but i doubt we gave them reason to attack us were not even certain that the organisms hostile
you didnt see that thing go after the captain it seemed hostile enough to me
the kreetassans might know something about this thing i can start scanning for their ship try to pick up their warp trail
well need to communicate with them better than last time
ill do my best
tpol to doctor phlox report
im preparing to examine the specimen would you care to observe
yes stand by
youll note that even though its been severed from its body it survives independently
not unlike the common earthworm or the neethian cradlefish
do you think thats wise doctor
possibly not but im going to need a tissue sample if i hope to learn more about its physiology
thatll be quite enough this is no earthworm
doctor
look at the synaptic activity this organism possesses a very sophisticated nervous system it could be capable of higher mental functions
if its intelligent maybe we can communicate with it the frequency distortions they look a lot like the phonetic patterns in certain andorian dialects
with all due respect hoshi were not talking about nouns and verbs here it could take you days to learn a language like that even if it is one
what other choice do we have give me a chance
im sorry ensign there isnt enough time
subcommander
we need to neutralise it quickly you said phase pistols had no effect
none that i could tell
then i suggest you find a method that does
if i may the organism is highly photosensitive a sustained burst of em radiation might be enough to stun the creature
can you assemble some em emitters
itll take a few minutes
why doesnt it just kill us
take it easy
im sure tpol and malcolm are doing everything they can to get us out of here can either of you see crewman kelly
yes sir
hows she look
shes still breathing
zabels still unconscious
captain
yeah
i imagine in a situation like this theyd cancel the movie
i imagine so
i really wanted to see it yves montand driving explosives through the mountains
ill make sure they reschedule it for next week
thank you sir
its working
bridge somethings wrong
shut off the emitters
doctor
shut them off
off
what happened
their nervous systems appear to be linked to the organisms theyre sharing autonomic functions neural impulses if we continue firing we could end up killing our own people
mister reed withdraw your team
understood
the rate of symbiosis is increasing if we dont find a way to extract them soon their systems will be too integrated with the creature i wont be able to separate them
you wanted a chance to communicate i suggest you begin
how much time do they have
a few hours at most their metabolic rates are dropping temperature respiration
there must be some way to cut them out of there
im not sure if you appreciate how alien this creature is its not attacking our crewmen its trying to integrate them into itself
the end results the same
at some point in the very near future there wont be six lifeforms in that cargo bay therell only be one
if that thing continues to grow were going to have to find a way to contain it
do you have a suggestion
starfleets been working on creating a stable em barrier for the last five years
a force field
right they just havent found a way to control the particle density all the specs are in the database ive been trying to jerryrig a prototype of my own
and
ive got it stable enough to absorb a phase pistol blast sixty percent of the time i think i can improve on that
i suggest you work quickly
i think i found them
where
point five two light years from here
lay in a course
i already have ive been sending out hails but were still out of comm range
let me know as soon as they respond
any progress
believe me youd be the first to know im sorry its frustrating im not having a lot of luck
the situation requires expertise not luck
maybe i dont have the expertise
if you dont no one else aboard enterprise does
im doing my best
it was your suggestion that we attempt to communicate with it if you dont think thats possible well have to find another solution
ive made a little progress but our translation matrix isnt designed for this look at it its more like a calculus equation than a language
mathematics is sometimes considered a form of language
what im trying to say is that i could use help from someone with a background in higher mathematics
perhaps i can assist you
the texas goalie cant block to his right because he keeps his hands too deep
how do you know that
captain i know it too and i dont understand anything about water polo
its this lifeform its linking us together somehow
we got to get out
calm down
this things gotten inside our heads
trip do you know what im thinking about
nows not the time to be thinking about the regionals
trip
senior year north american regionals against princeton we i mean you were down by two goals under a minute left
and what was i thinking what was i thinking
you thought you could win every game you always thought you could win no matter how far behind you were
and we did we went on the finals that year as soon as you give up the games lost
hows our little friend
fast asleep it appears to have entered a dormant state probably a reaction to the shock of being severed from the larger organism
but its alive
very much so
good now if you dont mind id like to run a few tests of my own
what kind of tests
i need to determine how much bioelectric stress it can tolerate
may i ask why
im trying to create a force field to isolate the cargo bay but if its going to work i have to calculate how much of a jolt it will take to repel the organism without killing it or any of the people its taken
if you intend to pummel this appendage with em radiation until it cries for mercy im afraid i cant permit that
why not
this is more than just a severed limb it exhibits all the signs of an intelligent being
intelligent being or not its big brother is in the cargo bay strangling the captain and four other crewmen if we dont do something to contain it now it could pose a threat to everyone on board
there are less invasive ways to gather the information you need
such as
microcellular analysis
how long would that take
less than an hour
in less than an hour that thing could spread across half a deck
im willing to help you mister reed but not if it means torturing this organism correct me if im wrong but isnt our mission to try to better understand unique forms of life
not if theyre trying to kill the captain
we dont know anything about this creatures intentions
i admire your interspecies ethics but until hoshi tells me shes found a way to communicate with it i have to assume its intentions are hostile now if you dont mind
if you want information to help you construct your force field youll acquire it under my supervision
im sure i dont have to remind you doctor i am the ranking officer here
not in my sickbay unless the captain says otherwise
the captain is in no condition to offer an opinion
precisely
fine your rules but wed better get to it
what if we used a bilateral algorithm
i already tried
did you compensate for frequency drift
i wouldnt be much of a comm officer if i didnt
allowing your emotions to control you wont help solve this problem ensign
neither will questioning everything i do
you asked for my help
i didnt ask for you to keep count of every time i make a mistake or to secondguess all of my decisions
as first officer its my duty to supervise you
this goes beyond duty subcommander youve been looking over my shoulder ever since you came on board doublechecking my log entries my translations
its my job
is that all were talking about you dont think i belong on enterprise do you
on the contrary it would be a great loss to starfleet if you were not a part of this crew if you feel ive been unfair to you i apologise but i hold you to a high standard ensign because i know youre capable of achieving it shall we continue
yes why dont we take another look at the subharmonics i was thinking we could run it through the decryption matrix see if we can find a pattern all i see is numbers codes
any code can be broken
you hailed us
you speak english
we studied your database it wasnt difficult
okay we have a problem
yes
therean alien organism on our ship
yes
it came aboard around the same time we saw you we were hoping you might know something about it
describe this organism
well its big but it didnt start out that way its like a large mass of tendrils
tendrils
like a giant web but it moves and grows
we have seen this
where
on its home world perhaps it attached itself to our ship it wasnt our fault
can you tell us where this planet is
apologise
excuse me
we will send you the coordinates but first you must apologise to us for your offence
thats the thing we dont know what we did to offend you
on your ship you put food in your mouths
you mean eat
yes eat
i dont understand
it is like mating it is very offensive to us
we were just eating how do you eat
we eat the same way but not in the presence of others
i see okay please believe me we had no idea that would be offensive to you it was simply a misunderstanding on behalf of the entire crew i sincerely apologise
your apology is accepted
thank you now could i have those coordinates
captain
yeah
i feel youve drifted away over there
you arent feeling much better than i do rostov
hes out when zephram cochrane talked about new life and new civilisation do you think this is what he meant
here here it is i found a third set of repetitions try it just a few more and the ut can start building a syntax
phlox to tpol
go ahead
i know youre under a great deal of pressure
but crewman kellys metabolic rate has dropped to a critical level whatever youre planning to do
youd better do it soon
understood
ready sir
the particle densitys still fluctuating i think the problems in the lower left quadrant
got it sir
try again
better
tpol to lieutenant reed
go ahead
weve made some progress on the translation but were going to need to get into the cargo bay to test it is the forcefield ready
im making the final calibrations now
youll have to do it quickly doctor phlox says our people dont have much time
understood
captain
emitter bs off by three point two microns
the forcefields working but i cant guarantee how long it will hold have you done it
were about to find out
it just sounds like a constant tone
im going to create distortions in the tone hopefully the organism will understand what im trying to do
come on just a little more i think ive got enough to try something simple
ask what it wants
its talking to us
whats it saying ensign
hold on its giving us coordinates
its home world
the kreetassans already gave them to us
these look more like the latitude and longitude i think its trying to give us an exact location of the planet
tell it were taking it back
commander tuckers heart rate is increasing
is that good or bad
good crewman kellys biosigns are stabilising as well
lower the force field lieutenant
medical team report to cargo bay two
acknowledged
here
look at all of them
not them it this is all one organism
the part that got on board why did it take our people
hard to say when it got separated from itself perhaps it needed a physical connection with any lifeform it could find
excuse me
i asked if youve
we heard you what makes you think were suffering from a lack of sexual activity
starfleet forbids officers from fraternising with subordinates unless youve been violating regulations
those regulations dont apply to you have you been suffering
on vulcan we mate only once every seven years
thats a hell of a dry spell
why are you suddenly so curious about this
its my understanding that your mating ritual is effective in easing tension
that hasnt always been my experience
and you think that we need our tensions eased
efficiencys down three percent
weve all gone about ten months without a break i think its normal for people to get a little sloppy
perhaps its time the crew takes shore leave
well i like the sound of that
i took the liberty of locating a suitable planet approximately nine days from our present location its called risa
whats your idea of suitable
its tropical with an abundance of pristine beaches youll find more information in the vulcan database
is it populated
yes by a humanoid culture receptive to easing tension
look at this theyve got sea rays the size of shuttlepods
i didnt know you were a diver
ive never done it but if there was ever a time to learn your guides are genetically enhanced to breathe underwater and theyre all female
mermaids
i read that at any time there can be thousands of visitors there speaking hundreds of different languages
are you going to spend your vacation doing the same thing youve been doing onboard for the last ten months
how i relax is my business
how about you lieutenant
well im certainly up for meeting some new people
why dont you come with me
i appreciate the offer but i was hoping for something more than a linguistic seminar
if youre wearing that to impress the women on risa you may as well stay on board
rule number one youve got to be seen to get noticed and i plan on getting noticed
dont say she didnt warn you
figured out your itinerary yet
i think im going to pass
captain you need this as much as i do
nobody needs this as much as you do the ship will be nice and quiet ive got some astrometric surveys that have been piling up itll be a good chance to get some work done
were going to a planet with over two hundred registered nuvian masseuses and youre going to sit in your cabin with a bunch of star charts
mister tucker has a point
you think i need a massage
the safety of this ship depends on its captain being at his most efficient
i suppose i could read those surveys on a nice beach
incoming transmission from starfleet command
transfer it to my ready room
her names vlar shes the vulcan ambassador to a planet called mazar
if you dont mind my asking admiral why is this our problem
apparently its imperative that she be taken off that planet as soon as possible the nearest vulcan ship is at least a week away
do they expect us to take her all the way back to vulcan
youll rendezvous with the vulcan ship shraan in three days theyll take her the rest of the way
any idea what the emergency is
well this may come as a shock to you jon but the vulcans arent talking
imagine that
thank you for volunteering your quarters
im happy to do it im looking forward to meeting her
i imagine shell spend most of the journey alone engaged in meditation but if it seems appropriate ill ask if shell meet with you
thanks well if theres anything else i can do
if you wouldnt mind taking that
ambassador vlar is accustomed to a spartan environment
hoshi thanks for giving up your cabin
i just hope its spartan enough sir
everything set
i believe so ive prepared this to familiarize the crew with the necessary protocols
we should assign a steward to attend to her needs
dont address the ambassador unless spoken to first dont offer to shake hands refrain from laughing in her presence
those guidelines are largely precautionary i doubt the crew will have much opportunity to interact with her
you seem to be pulling out all the stops
im simply following the protocols used in dealing with an ambassador of vlars distinction
well shell be here soon enough let me know if you need any help
thank you captain
entering orbit sir
were being hailed its the mazarite high council
someones in a hurry
captain archer
im jonathan archer
are you prepared to receive ambassador vlar
thats why were here if youll transmit your landing coordinates to us well send down a shuttlepod im looking forward to the visit
i regret there wont be time for that the ambassador is already on her way to your ship
a small crafts approaching sir
i assume the vulcans have informed you of the urgency of this matter
they said it was important we pick up the ambassador as quickly as possible they didnt say why
vlar has been expelled for abuse of her position and criminal misconduct
captain archer
ambassador on behalf of my crew id like to welcome you aboard enterprise
thank you
may i take that
thats very thoughtful captain
this is commander charles tucker my chief engineer
pleased to meet you
the pleasure is mine commander
and this is my science officer subcommander tpol
tnar pahk sarat yrani
tnar jaral but please ive been anticipating the opportunity to practice my english
i hope you like your quarters ambassador tpol tried very hard to anticipate your needs
fortunately my needs are few captain i am curious though who previously occupied the cabin
the odour the human scent is difficult to mask
actually i was hoping to meet the crew member in order to thank her for allowing me to disrupt her routine i prefer not to inconvenience anyone if possible that philosophy has served me well in the diplomatic service
tpol tells me you negotiated the first territorial accords between vulcan and andoria
the andorians required a somewhat firmer hand at the negotiating table but i was younger then that was before we even made contact with earth
that was over ninety years ago how long have you been a diplomat
commander tucker i understood that on your world it is considered bad manners to ask a lady her age
well i wasnt er i er didnt mean to imply that you were er
forgive me commander my attempt at humour suffice it to say that with tpol and myself here youre almost certainly dining with the two oldest people on this ship
i hope ambassador that you regard the charges against you with less levity
of course i do
how do you intend to defend yourself
there is no defence
are you saying youre guilty
tpol
its all right captain a person in my position carries the trust of all vulcans the fact that the mazarites believe that trust has been compromised justifies tpols concern im afraid my age is betraying me captain would you mind if i retired
of course not
ive never been to earth but i find the humans i have encountered quite unpredictable id be interested in hearing about your experiences there
another time perhaps
i understand
this is your cabin ill say good night
tpol i sense your anger
you presume that my time with humans has left me susceptible to their emotions
theyre our emotions as well we simply hide them better
if youre sensing anything from me it isnt anger
no disappointment
good night ambassador
tpol
captain
is there a problem i should be aware of
i assume youre talking about ambassador vlar
you were a bit abrupt with her
if you believe i was rude ill convey my apologies
i dont pretend to understand vulcans i never have but i wouldnt be a very good captain if i didnt know when something was bothering my science officer
its uncommon for a vulcan to commit a crime
uncommon but not unheard of
unheard of for a person in ambassador vlars position
we dont know what shes done
it doesnt matter if she were innocent she would have insisted on staying to defend herself
you seem to know a lot about her
ive met the ambassador before though she clearly doesnt recall it was many years ago on vulcan during my early schooling she had just negotiated the treaty of katann and i travelled a great distance to see her
was it worth the trip
the ambassador inspired me to choose a direction in my own life a path that led me to the science council and eventually here
ive had a few heroes in my life its never easy when one of them lets you down
vulcans dont have heroes
no im sure they dont
captain can you come to the bridge
on my way
an unidentified vessel sir fifty thousand kilometres and closing
theyre hailing us
lets find out who they are  what can we do for you
my apologies captain theres been a change of plans regarding ambassador vlar
we werent told
weve been having some problems with our longrange communications
whats the change of plans
the magistrate feels that we let the ambassador go too quickly shes needed for additional questioning we dont want to cause you any more inconvenience if youll drop out of warp we can dock with you and take the ambassador aboard our ship
your magistrate seemed in a big hurry to get rid of her now he wants her back
im just a transport captain i never try to make sense of what government bureaucrats are thinking
ill have to contact my superiors
theres really no need
im just a starship captain you dont think theyd trust me to make these kinds of decisions on my own
well wait for you to confirm whatever you have to
get me starfleet command
i cant get through that ships jamming all our comm frequencies
just a transport captain
theyre charging weapons
polarise the hull plating
what the hell is he doing hail him
hes not answering
port hull platings offline
theyre closing fast
aft torpedoes return fire
no effect theyre using some kind of energy shielding
direct hit to engineering subsection 12 weve taken damage
would the phase cannons be more effective
undoubtedly but we cant fire them at warp
what do you mean we cant fire them at warp
particle discharge sir it would destabilize our warp field and most likely blow out both our nacelles ive been working on the problem but i havent quite
drop to impulse deploy the aft cannon
ive got a lock
fire
their shields are failing
see what you can do about their engines
theyre dead in the water sir
not dead enough
resume course warp four
aye sir
any idea what that was all about  well i think we know someone who might
we were asked to pick you up and deliver you to a vulcan ship no one said anything about getting shot at
you have no idea who they were
obviously they werent sent by the council on mazar
then who sent them
i have no answers for you
ambassador were here at the request of the vulcan high command it would be illogical for you to withhold information from us
there are diplomatic matters at stake here which do not concern you to tell you any more would only put your ship and your crew at greater risk
how much greater could it get a few more volleys from that ship would have ruptured our hull
im sorry captain
so am i youre leaving me no choice ambassador archer to mayweather
go ahead
change of plans travis lay in a course back to mazar
sir
you heard me
aye sir
youre under strict orders to transport me to the shraan
its more than two days to the rendezvous point and there could be other hostile ships tracking us unless you can convince me why its worth risking all our lives
the vulcans are raising holy hell about this jon
you could always order me to take her to the rendezvous point
youre out there im not its your call i just want you to know therell be repercussions
they certainly considered the repercussions they knew someone was after her why risk one of your own ships when you can risk one of ours
jon
theyre doing it to us again admiral keeping us in the dark
have you talked to the ambassador
ive tried
maybe she brought this on herself you did say that she admitted the charges against her were true
i dont even know what the charges against her are
well ill talk to soval see what i can find out
you really enjoy this dont you
replacing power couplings hardly
no i mean having people shoot at us
if you must know i much prefer the shooting back part
i thought this mission was about peaceful exploration
i need something to do on this ship commander
fair enough im just hoping we dont keep you quite so busy i read those nuvian masseuses have twelve fingers on each hand
then id say starfleet needs to make its presence known on risa
i hope im not interrupting
not at all
we were just talking about my quarters
i was wondering why they were so sparsely decorated
if you need anything it can be brought to you
i dont want to be waited on and since i doubt ill be travelling to earth any time soon i decided to spend a little time with my hosts thank you for the use of your quarters youll have them back soon enough
pash tah
pash tah
subcommander
have you tried iced tea
i dont care for it
captain archer certainly does its flavoured with passion fruit an appropriate ingredient for him dont you think
it was the captain that i wanted to speak to you about
hes a most intriguing man
he deserves to be told the truth
will you join me please well be back at mazar in a few hours id prefer not to waste that time alone this must be awkward for you having a foot in two worlds loyal to your captain yet still a vulcan
you can make things easier for him the high command has requested his assistance it doesnt seem unreasonable to ask why
you believe captain archer can be trusted
yes
even though he clearly doesnt trust us
hes resentful
why
he believes we held back their development of warp technology
weve kept many things from them all for good reason
but situations like this only reinforce their resentment if we expect to continue our relations with humanity we have to earn their trust
i would not have succeeded at my career for ninety four years without earning peoples trust
i meant no insult
of course not you were simply speaking your mind as you always have it was at vulcana regar wasnt it during the second katann conference you approached me during a recess
you remember
you were not easy to forget your questions about my negotiating tactics were quite presumptuous coming from one so young
i apologise if i acted inappropriately
not at all in fact your bluntness made me reconsider some of my positions much as it has now tpol i have something to tell you
come in
something wrong
i took the liberty of speaking with ambassador vlar
go on
any luck
the ambassador and i spent the last two hours talking shes even more remarkable than her reputation suggests
i dont doubt that but it doesnt affect my decision
i believe it should shes not guilty of the crime shes been accused of
she told you that
the charges were fabricated to get her off mazar and divert attention from her actual mission
which is
she cant reveal that but shes convinced me that its critical we help her accomplish it
im sorry tpol but im going to need more than that
she also told me that if we return her to mazar shell be killed
by who
she wouldnt tell me
but you believed her
yes
why
i cant accept that shed sacrifice a lifetime of accomplishments with an act of criminal misconduct
it happens all the time
not to her we must take her to the shraan
youre asking me to put the lives of everyone on board in jeopardy based on your talking to this woman for a couple of hours
captain since ive served aboard enterprise ive never asked you for anything im asking for this now dont return the ambassador to mazar please  thank you
youve been to risa havent you
yes
well whats it like
a minshara class planet with three moons its gravity is approximately equal to earths sea level
hows the ocean
i wouldnt know
any good restaurants
im told there are its all in the database
did you do anything there
i meditated in an isolation chamber filled with warm alluvial mud
i imagine thats quite good for the skin  three ships coming up fast
polarise the hull plating captain report to the bridge
our mazarite friends sir and theyve brought company
why didnt we see them coming
our aft sensors are still out of alignment
theyre targeting our engines
we could drop to impulse use the phase cannons
and go three against one  youre familiar with the mazarites whats their top speed
comparable to starfleet i dont believe theyve exceeded warp five
then lets give them a run for their money travis increase speed to warp four point eight
aye sir warp four point eight
theyre matching our speed and accelerating warp four point nine
theyre closing to twenty thousand kilometres fifteen
archer to engineering
i was wondering when you were going to call were really stoking the boilers down here
keep shovelling were going to four point nine
just in case anyones keeping track i believe thatll be a starfleet record
lets celebrate later
travis
warp four point nine
theyre holding at four point nine sir
how far to the rendezvous point
at this speed a little over two hours but i dont think we can hold it that long
can we get a message through to the vulcans
the mazarites are still jamming us
keep trying that vulcan ship better not be late
captain whats our situation
were being chased by three mazarite ships
will we reach the shraan before they can do any more damage
im not sure
in that case i need to speak with you
i have to consider the possibility that this mission will fail
you still havent told me what this mission is
ive been under orders to tell you only what you need to know but that wasnt the only reason i kept things from you i didnt trust you as your mister tucker pointed out i have been around a long time i remember when news of your people first reached vulcan i was fascinated by humanity but worried as well
you hadnt even met us
you had just emerged from a global war the idea that you deemed yourselves ready to join the interstellar community seemed premature
and a century of good behaviour hasnt changed your mind
the mazarites pursuing us are criminals they are members of an organisation thats infiltrated all levels of government making themselves wealthy and powerful at the expense of many innocent victims their methods include eliminating anyone who stands in their way
and that would include you
many mazarites want their government purged of this corruption they asked the vulcan consulate to help them expose these criminals
and that job fell to you
i have been gathering evidence against them in three months i will be called to testify it was decided that until then i would be safer on vulcan
why couldnt you tell us
the investigation was considered too sensitive
and the story of you being recalled in disgrace
it was hoped that if my reputation were sullied they would not consider me a credible witness and they might not come after me
obviously it didnt work
the corruption ran deeper than i thought
i appreciate you telling me the truth
i can no longer put you and your crew in danger captain please drop out of warp i plan to surrender myself to them
it hasnt gotten to that yet
its the most logical course of action
if youve learned anything about humans youd know we dont always take the most logical course of action
captain report to the bridge
theyre hailing us
whats our status
holding at warp four point nine but commander tucker doesnt believe we can sustain it for more than another ten minutes
i dont believe they can either sir theyre releasing drive plasma to keep their warp coils from overloading
open a channel
captain ambassador
what do you want
just giving you a friendly warning are you aware that your engines are overheating
so are yours
we have no quarrel with you give us the vulcan and youll be free to go
i have a better idea why dont you slow down before your engines explode
why would you risk the lives of your crew for this criminal
ive been ordered to deliver her safely to the vulcans and thats exactly what i plan to do
theyre increasing speed warp four point nine five
theyre reentering weapons range sir
archer to engineering
please tell me youre ready to slow down
sorry trip but we need a little more speed
i dont know how much more i can give you
its called a warp five engine
on paper
we dont have any choice trip
aye sir
ambassador  warp five
four point nine three nine five
dont take your eyes off that antimatter stream
yes sir
four point nine seven
theyre matching our speed
four point nine nine warp five
theyre still gaining on us
how far to the vulcan ship
their jamming signal is disrupting our sensors as well
then use their last known position and do the math take a guess
if we could maintain our present speed approximately fifty three minutes
the mazarites will be in firing range long before then
what if we could get a message through tell them to get here as fast as they can
the shraan is capable of warp seven if we could maintain warp five wed reach them in twelve minutes
hoshi any way you can get a message through the interference
i dont see how sir
theres a diplomatic frequency we sometimes use its in a lower subspace band i doubt the mazarites are aware of it
its been a few years since i did this
if we do get a message through to the vulcans we dont want the mazarites to see them coming
we could try deflecting their jamming signal sir use it to blind their sensors as well
see what you can do
aye sir
hoshi
we may have gotten a message through to them sir but im not sure
wouldnt they respond
tucker to the bridge
go ahead
the port injectors just blew
weve got to slow down captain
i got it i got it
hoshi
the comm just went down sir
theyre right on top of us
how long
eight minutes
thats a direct hit to our starboard nacelle
were dropping to impulse
theyre hailing us
how long now
if they received our message another ten minutes
i thought it was down to eight
that was before we dropped out of warp
we cant hold off those ships for that long
youve done your best captain and i thank you for it but its time for me to turn myself over to them
we just need to buy ten more minutes
captain
i want you to go to sickbay
sickbay
ill explain later if there was ever a time to start trusting us this would be it
put him through
give us the vulcan
you know i honestly didnt think youd be able to catch us just out of curiosity how fast do your ships go
put her on a shuttle and bring her to our lead vessel
that could be a problem our shuttlebay was damaged thanks to you i doubt we could launch a shuttlepod until its repaired what what would you have topped out at warp five point five warp six i cant imagine that you can do much more than that it seemed like your engines were starting to run pretty hot
prepare to be boarded
malcolm im counting on you tpol
okay
where is she
your last attack blew out systems across half the ship powers down in engineering a plasma conduit exploded on e deck
i didnt ask for a damage report where is she
i was getting to that her quarters are on e deck she was no more than ten metres away when the conduit blew
her injuries are extensive plasma burns neurological trauma
i want to see her
this is doctor phlox
the vulcan
shes undergoing dermal regeneration
open it
i will not i dont know what business you have with this woman but when she was brought in here she became my patient if i remove her from the imaging chamber prematurely shell die
open it  yes
our sensors just went down captain
whats causing it
enterprise is redirecting our jamming signal
no
report answer me whats going on
i imagine they have their hands full right about now
i believe thats the shraan shes a vulcan combat cruiser one of their most powerful if im not mistaken
sir the captain of the shraan wants to speak to you
put it up
captain archer are you in any danger
you could say that
tell the mazarites to turn their weapons over immediately or well destroy their ships  well be standing by captain
thank you
we did what we came to do thats all that matters
i am sorry to disappoint you i look forward to adding this incident to my testimony at your trial
someday id like to walk into a room without it seeming like a state visit
occupational hazard
ill be along in a moment
thank you captain im sorry for the trouble ive caused you and your crew
were glad we could help
i sense a great bond between you a bond of trust and respect but also a bond of friendship i think it bodes well for the future relations of our two peoples
goodbye ambassador
live long and prosper
ive got my eye on a place called suraya bay villas built right into the cliffs a perfect spot to enjoy a few good books might even do a little diving when i  computer pause archer
were picking up a distress call captain its coming from a vessel approximately two light years to port
any idea who it is
no sir should we alter course
go ahead ill be right there  looks like your walk on the beach will have to wait
plasma residue
your warp injectors were full of it
i must be more diligent about routine maintenance
unless you enjoy being adrift in the middle of nowhere
im sorry to inconvenience you something this trivial be sure to thank mister tucker for his time
he wanted me to thank you it isnt every day he gets to tinker with alien engines we also found a microfracture on your starboard hull theyre sealing it now
oh your crew is very thorough
we were glad to help
do you answer every distress call you pick up
if we can
the galaxy could use more people like you
tomorrow youll join me in my home bring commander tucker ill prepare a meal in your honour its the least i can do to show my gratitude
thats very generous but i promised my crew a trip to risa
that can wait one more day cant it
if i put them off much longer im going to have a mutiny on my hands
theres going to be a geskana match i doubt youve ever seen anything like it
geskana
yes you might want to participate assuming you enjoy competition i should warn you captain i am easily offended
send me the coordinates ill break the news to my crew
dress for warm weather
if its all the same to you captain ill sit this one out
its not like you to pass up an away mission
well im up to my ears in work the impulse manifolds need to be purged the gravity plating on c deck still isnt aligned
trip
desert sir the heat the dry air you know how it sucks the life out of me
what about the two weeks we spent in australia we had a great time
survival training in the outback drinking recycled sweat and eating snake meat thats your idea of a great time
its not going to be like that i get the feeling zobrals a man who likes to indulge his guests hes promised to roll out the red carpet for us itll be more fun than purging impulse manifolds well suit yourself ill see if malcolms interested but i was hoping youd enjoy spending some time with your captain
promise i wont have to eat any snake meat
its hotter than hell out there forty one degrees
its a dry heat
welcome
good to be here you remember commander tucker
yes of course of course this is the man who repaired my ship a brilliant engineer
it was just a couple of clogged injectors
oh you are far too modest well i hope youre hungry ive prepared quite a feast
are there many deserts on your world
quite a few but none as big as this one
from orbit youd think the entire planets nothing but sand
oh well we have a handful of lakes and small seas what about earth
two thirds water
extraordinary more wine
please
whats that called again
yalasat its made from a cactus that grows in the northern foothills how was your roast teracaq
its very good when trip and i did our survival training in the desert we never ate this well
i must have lost about three kilos during that last week the heat always takes away my appetite
doesnt seem to be bothering you now
i guess im getting acclimated
it must be difficult adjusting to new cultures
its challenging at times but thats why were out here
did you ever think of turning back
only once we were attacked by a hostile species with a lot more firepower than enterprise i set a course back to earth to upgrade our weapons but we ended up having to do the repairs ourselves
they havent bothered us since
sounds like youve had an eventful journey
its had its share of surprises
well perhaps your visit here will be one of them  oh youre going to enjoy this
looks delicious what is it
blood soup i dont usually eat this well but i promised your captain an exceptional meal
what are these little chunks
the essence of the male chopped and seasoned
beautiful tapestries
thank you which do you prefer
that ones interesting
its yours
no no no i couldnt
please consider it a gift
youre far too generous besides i wouldnt have any place to hang it
something smaller then
i know you will appreciate this a suliban made it a suliban i met several years ago interesting people dont you agree
thank you
the geskana match is about to begin im hoping you will honour us by participating
now i just ate half a teracaq
you will be glad you did geskana requires a great deal of strength
think youre ready
ill give it a shot captain
i cant promise well win any trophies
this is an ideal game for men like you
thanks
were being hailed
the captain
no its coming from a city on the far side of the desert
put it through this is enterprise
several hours ago you launched a small vessel to an encampment in the cygniai expanse would you tell me why
our captain and chief engineer were invited
by whom
a man named zobral and you are
chancellor trellit why are you in contact with this man
his ship was damaged and we assisted him in return he offered his hospitality
hospitality i hope youre aware that most likely youll never see your captain or engineer again
you all right
never better
open open up block out here here here here get in front of him cut him off now
so close
two centimetres to the right and youd have had it
next time ill set you up with a nolook pass
all right
archer
i need to speak to you captain
can it wait were a little busy at the moment
its urgent are you alone
hold on a minute  its my science officer she says its important do you mind
take your time
catch your breath
whats the problem
ive been contacted by a government official in a city about two hundred kilometres from where you are now he claims that youre in danger
what kind of danger
according to him
zobral and his men are terrorists
theyve been responsible for numerous attacks on civilian targets within the city
maybe im wrong but they dont seem like terrorists to me
perhaps not but until were certain who they are i suggest you return to the ship
were on our way
i hope everything is all right
the problem with being a starship captain is youre never really off duty im afraid we have to cut our visit short
oh im sorry to hear that
hats going on
problem with the starboard engine tpol says she needs us up there right away
cant we at least finish this quarter
remember those impulse manifolds you said needed purging you were right
well thanks for one hell of a game
you must have other people that can correct this problem
i wish we did
as i said captain i am easily offended
well come back if theres time i promise
you should not believe the torothans i have just been informed that we picked up a lengthy transmission between your vessel and chancellor trellit whatever he told your science officer it is not true i wanted this to wait till later but i beg you let me explain the real reason why i asked you here you have a reputation for being fair a man of great integrity when you hear what i have to say i am certain you will want to help us
it is called a yrott the word means to stand apart when we lived in the cities we were forced to wear these whenever we walked in public
i take it those days are over
when the caste system was finally abolished we were led to believe that everyone would be treated equally i remember the celebrations yrotts being burned in the streets people saying that we had finally been granted our rights the torothan clan signed the accord but they never abided by it they still control the government the lands the resources everything we spent ten years staging protests appealing to the courts until finally we realised there was only one way to get their attention we have hundreds of camps just like this one all across the desert and we are going to keep attacking the torothans until our voices are heard they call us terrorists but the truth is they have been terrorising us for centuries
you said you brought me down here for a reason i have a feeling it wasnt to hear a history lesson
the torothans have ten times as many soldiers as we do we wont last much longer without your help
i really dont see what i can do for you
they said you would be humble i scanned your vessel you have an arsenal of powerful weapons but more importantly i need your wisdom our current strategy isnt working but i am confident that together we can find one that does i would be honoured to fight alongside you as would all of my men
what the hell was that
torothan cruisers usually they begin their bombardment after dark theyre getting started early today
i dont know what youve heard about me but i think youve been misled
what about the suliban
what about them
you liberated a detention camp freed thousands of prisoners
who told you that
a suliban transport captain he told me of an explorer who was also a great warrior a man who helped them defeat an entire army captain jonathan archer
two cruisers sir theyve hit one of our pulse cannons
prepare my ship this wont last more than a few hours well continue this discussion later
if its all the same to you wed rather get back to enterprise
oh your shuttles thrusters would draw their attention youd become an easy target please i wouldnt be a very good host if i allowed you to get killed
theres a number of ships strafing the encampment
hail the captain
archer
captain are you all right
weve taken shelter should be
thats the best i can give you the entire region is flooded with jamming signals
well we cant just leave them down there what about the transporter
i cant localise their biosigns ill take a shuttlepod and find them myself
in the middle of an assault  see if you can find chancellor trellit
archer to enterprise enterprise respond  rough game
that damn midfielder knocked me down three times during the last quarter i mustve bruised half a dozen ribs
better have doctor phlox take a look at it when we get back
so does the great warrior have any ideas about how were getting out of here youre not thinking about helping these people
i was thinking about those suliban prisoners if we hadnt helped them escape we wouldnt be in this situation
tpols ears must be burning want your chief engineers advice
what is it
walk away they lured us down here under false pretenses and now theyre asking us to help them fight a war thats a lot different than breaking a few innocent people out of prison
theres just one problem zobral i get the feeling hes not going to take no for an answer
come on
i dont know about you but id rather take my chances out in that desert
i thought you hated the desert
not tonight
you neglected to mention that youd be attacking the encampment
and you assured me your people would be leaving the surface why didnt they
captain archer wanted to speak with zobral
interesting where are they now
i dont know if youd be willing to end your assault we could launch a search party
you expect us to stand by while you send more people to join zobral
if you believe were assisting the terrorists youre mistaken
of course i forgot they just went down for the hospitality
let us find them and well leave immediately
thats what you promised before well locate your men ourselves and deal with them accordingly thats assuming they havent already been killed
chancellor
if you attempt to launch another shuttlecraft well have no choice but to consider it as an enemy vessel
ive lost sensor contact with the surface some kind of orbital dispersion field i cant get any readings below a hundred kilometres
two men out in the open youd think they would have spotted us by now were down here
youre going to have to yell a little louder than that
you sure were going in the right direction
it was east of the camp were heading east
how far
about thirty kilometres
thirty what if we find more of zobrals men inside
it looked abandoned
all i saw was sand i dont remember any buildings
thats because you forgot your survival training take a good look on your way in at your surroundings
didnt they also say something about only walking at night cant we wait until it cools down a little
that could be for another eight or nine hours we need to find shelter
twenty minutes captain
trip
ten
to cherryflavoured snow cones what i wouldnt give for one right about now
you hear that
what
it sounds like a ship
i think the heats getting to you
no listen over there a shuttlepod
no something a lot bigger
you all right
yeah
the dispersion field covers half the continent but if i disable these three satellites i think i can get a clear reading of the eastern desert
that might provoke the torothans i suggest you try to find a less intrusive way to penetrate their defenses
why montana of all the places the vulcans could have landed they chose bozeman montana
humanitys first warp drive was developed there it seemed a logical place to begin
well how did they know it wouldnt alarm other nations an alien species makes contact with the united states it could have made a lot of other countries nervous
whats your point
it seems to me that were going to run into similar problems we get invited to dinner and before you know it were accused of taking sides in a war
contacting new worlds always involves unexpected risks the high command has very specific protocols regarding planetary conflicts eventually captain archer will have to create some directives of his own
come on come on we got to keep moving come on
my shift doesnt begin for another six hours
were almost there
where where are we going
nice little place i know plenty of shade
are there blankets down there im freezing
heat exhaustion here come here
here there you go easy easy
here take mine go ahead
no sir i wont take another mans water
you drink it thats an order
got to keep moving
take the water or ill knock you on your ass and pour it down your throateasy
thanks
theres a vessel approaching from the surface its zobral
hes hailing us
open your launch doors quickly
is the captain with you commander tucker
no no ill explain once im aboard
where are they
if im not in your docking bay in the next thirty seconds ill be detected theyll destroy my ship
bring him in
how many
there were eighty nine there were only eighty nine suliban not thousands
and the army you defeated
i would hardly call it an army it was more like a few dozen prison guards and to be honest they didnt put up much of a fight
jonathan archer is an excellent starship captain but hes hardly the invincible warrior described to you
what about his legendary desert tactics
actually im the tactical officer on this ship and i dont have any experience at waging desert warfare im afraid youve come to the wrong people for help
all this for nothing
what about our people
you have far better sensors than we do im sure youll find them
our sensors are being disrupted and the torothans have threatened to fire on us if we launch a shuttlepod
how did you get here without them seeing you
there was a narrow gap in their orbital detection grid it occurs once every forty six minutes but it is only open for less than one minute
ill need all the pertinent data
ha youll need more than that the manoeuvres are extremely difficult it took us years to learn them
im a quick study
you will be shot down before you reach the atmosphere
with you at the helm our chances would improve
i dont have time my men are waiting for me
then theyll have to wait a little longer youre the one that got our people stranded down there
they are not my responsibility
youre mistaken the torothans believe weve joined your cause if captain archer and commander tucker are apprehended theyll undoubtedly be treated as members of your clan theyll become victims of the same oppression youve been fighting all these years you should feel as responsible for those two men as you do for your own
easy
home sweet home
i hope youre not planning to hog that all for yourself
waters off the menu
now this is my idea of a great time
whatd you do rub two sticks together
i found a new use for the stun setting it may not taste too good but i think i boiled away anything that can hurt us
no thanks im not thirsty
lets not get into that argument again
worse than blood soup
you need water
what i need is sleep
youve got a fever trip your hearts racing youve got all the symptoms of heatstroke if you fall asleep you could lapse into a coma
a coma that sounds nice
when we get back to enterprise you can sleep all you want but right now you got to stay with me and drink this water if i had a needle id give it you intravenously but i dont come on sit up here you go good commander
aye captain
the warp reactor break it down for me
what
what are the eight major components
you got to be kidding me
name them thats an order
well theres the drumsticks thighs wings you got anything to eat around here
not at the moment but when we get back to enterprise ill have chef make you a dinner youll never forget what would you like anything
not snake meat
no chef doesnt do snake very well tell me what you want
prime rib
okay what else
mashed potatoes with mushroom gravy the kind he makes on wednesday nights
no problem what kind of vegetables hey vegetables
broccoli
dessert
pecan pie
take another pass over the eastern basin
our sensors would have detected them
no theres magnetic deposits below that basin they could be masking their biosigns
if we increased our altitude this would go a lot faster
we would also risk being detected
geography do you know how to play
geography
you know you say amazon river which ends in an r and then i say rhode island
were going to rhode island
no no its a game youre supposed to tell me some place that starts with a d
oh d er draylax
x x
theres always
no no dont tell me i know an x xanadu
thats not a real place
it doesnt matter
of course it matters
you just used an alien planet draylax
easy easy easy easy easy
all right whatever you say xanadus fine
get your head down
what
get down
we got to get out of here come on
im picking up weapons fire on the surface ninety kilometres due south
a torothan mortar
would they be targeting one of your settlements
we dont have any near there
set a course and prepare to fire i believe theyve located the captain and commander tucker
come on come on
ive got a lock
fire
i see them two humans bearing one one five mark three
im just slowing you down go
i dont remember taking orders from you
my launch window opens in nine minutes i should be going i hope commander tucker is going to be all right
i doubt ill ever convince him to set foot on another desert but hell be fine zobral even if i were the warrior you thought i was thats not why were out here
captain subcommander
what you told him was correct decisions to get involved in the conflicts of other worlds should be left to governments and not starship captains
i know the irony is i have the feeling his cause is worth fighting for
itd be a shame to deprive any of your people
we appreciate your hospitality but a minimal number of crewmembers need to stay on board
if you add a few days to your stay you could give everyone a chance to enjoy themselves the additional charge would be minimal
its tempting but we need to keep some dilithium to run our engines
dont be so sure after two days and nights on risa you may never want to leave i see your crew has chosen a wide variety of locales and activities that should keep them very entertained but i see you wont be joining us subcommander
ive visited risa before it seemed appropriate to give someone else a chance
well im sorry as im sure you remember we have many diversions designed for our vulcan guests
so this covers everything
the package is allinclusive
everything you know food drinks souvenirs
trust me mister tucker  no one will go away disappointed
if anything happens you know where to reach me
i dont anticipate any problems
well its the problems you dont anticipate
the crew is trained to handle emergencies but ill alert you immediately if there are any problems
this doesnt feel right i shouldnt be going down to some pleasure planet while half the crew has to stay onboard
everyone drew lots you had the same chance as the others
all the same the crew should come first
captain you need a vacation
im glad you decided to take some time off sir
wouldnt miss it
do you want to take the helm captain
im on vacation
thanks
enjoy yourselves
ill bring you a souvenir
everyone have big plans travis
rockclimbing sir theres a place called galartha the cliff face changes pitch while you climb it
that sounds kind of dangerous
well if its easy whats the point
just watch yourself malcolm
well supposedly risas very cosmopolitan there are species visiting from all over
malcolm and i plan to broaden our cultural horizons
is that all you two think about
well how we choose to relax is our own business
you watch yourselves too
i plan on doing something constructive with my time i have been relying on the universal translator far too much before i left earth i learned thirty eight languages and now all i do is push a button and the computer does all the work
isnt that what its for
not this time i left my translator on enterprise
you only have two days hoshi if you want to waste your time talking to people
what about you captain
ive never been much for vacations but ive got a little villa overlooking the ocean and porthos and i are going to relax
how long will this last
i usually require six days per year but two should leave me sufficiently refreshed
ive adjusted the dosage to wake you up in exactly forty eight hours
and if someone should require medical attention during your hibernation
crewman cutler is a capable medic
i know where the bandages are
you can always wake me if you need to but please only if its an emergency  well to bed
pleasant dreams doctor
what do you think porthos not bad
come here lets go what are you barking at
what about that one
now i know youve been cooped up on a starship for too long
whats wrong with her
well nothing i suppose i just wouldnt know which eyes to look into hey hey hey hey now shes interesting
i dont think she is the right pronoun but if you think its worth the risk
i dont know maybe i should have brought my scanner with me
thank you
thats a she
what shall we drink to
to us and to a wellearned two days and two nights
howd you get up here stop it you two porthos  come in
im sorry to bother you but i think my dog is on your deck
please
there you are
i hope she didnt hurt
porthos
hello porthos shes been cooped up for weeks i should have known shed run off the first chance she got
no harm done she probably just came over to make a friend im jonathan
keyla
so is this your first time to risa
yes you
first time my science officer felt i needed to relax so i decided to do some reading let porthos run on the beach
you should always listen to your science officer
shed be the first to agree with you i was about to go out for dinner can you recommend a restaurant
theres this little boat that sails into the bay every evening just after sunset you wade out and they serve seafood right off the deck
sounds great
well im sorry to disturb you thanks again
if you dont have other plans maybe we could wade out to that little boat together
youre not here with your science officer
no
in that case oh no im sorry i cant tonight
just a thought
tomorrow
i look forward to it
so do i goodbye porthos
tikara
tikara
its a beautiful night
youve obviously never been here before
why do you say that
the nights are always beautiful
slowly please im just learning risan
really most people wouldnt bother
when i go someplace i like to learn the language
how long will you be here
just today and tomorrow
youve never spoken risan before today
na no how am i doing
exceptionally you hardly have any accent
sara
its been nice talking to you
were attending the festival of the moons tonight you should go if you have the time
thank you ill try
goodnight
goodnight
ikara
ikara
i dont mean to be rude but i overheard your conversation
oh
youre very adept at languages
its my job im the communications officer on a starship shikara hoshi my name is hoshi
ravis
may i  how many languages do you speak
about forty
have you ever heard one you couldnt learn
not yet klingon was hard it took me months to master the conjugations
do you think you could learn my language
where are you from
thats the name of your planet say it slower
you cant say it slower it changes the meaning
try it again
dont feel bad my own people can barely speak it properly
im not ready to give up will you teach me
it could take a while i was about to have dinner will you join me
that place up the street looked pretty lively
well the vulcan database said no one leaves this club unhappy
how would the vulcans know they only mate once every seven years
thats what they say
do you know something i dont
come on seven years i doubt even tpol could hold out that long
oh shes very disciplined
malcolm bearing one eight zero
what
behind you
anything in that database that could help us get a conversation going
if you wanted to have a cultural dialogue you should have gone with hoshi
hello
hello
im deeahn and this is latia
im trip
im malcolm would you join us for a drink
weve been waiting for you to ask
well what would you like
these look good
another round please
so where are you two from
our planets called earth
earth never heard of it
were sort of new to the neighbourhood
well then well have to make sure that your first visit to risa is memorable
jonathan youre up late
just looking at the stars
dont you get enough of that on your ship
never
will you show me what youre looking at
come on up
i wanted to thank you the little boat with the seafood best ive ever had
im sorry you had to eat alone
no problem i had a nice chat with a couple from vega reticuli it turns out its their three hundredth wedding anniversary
well they must have a lot of stories
you cant imagine there it is
what am i looking for
see the bright blue star at the top
is that your sun
no look just below the yellow one do you see it
its so faint
its about ninety light years from here
youre a long way from home
actually this is the farthest any of my people have ever gone
youre an explorer i wouldnt be surprised if theyre naming schools after you back on your world
archer elementary it has a nice ring to it can you show me where youre from
oh i really dont have a very good sense of direction
oh im sure its not that bad
i got lost coming back from the lobby today
well i can see how that could happen i mean its at least a hundred metres from here
and all the villas look the same
youve just got to notice the subtle differences
like the numbers on the doors
now youre catching on give me a couple hours i could have you navigating a starship
why dont you start by telling me about some of the places youve been well get to the starship navigation later
we only had a few hours of air left so i jettisoned our engine and blew it up turned it into a rescue flare
it was my idea
doesnt matter whose idea it was it worked
why dont you tell them about the time you saved enterprise in your underwear
i saved the captains life
i thought you were the captain
we rotate hes captain next week
so captains have you seen the subterranean gardens
subterranean
all the plants that grow there are luminescent its beautiful
maybe you could show us
through here
this is a strange way to get to the garden
theyre very secluded so how much do starship captains get paid on your world
excuse me
what kind of valuables do you have
i think theres been a misunderstanding
theres definitely been a misunderstanding
see what they have
i hope this isnt their mating ritual
quiet nothing
maybe they have something back in their rooms
its too risky we could sell their clothes
listen i bet we could make some kind of a deal
enterprise
its travis subcommander could you send a shuttlepod down
whats the problem ensign
i had a little rockclimbing accident
where are you
in the central hospital but i really want to get back to enterprise
the fun part is the way the rock face changes the problem is the handholds change too
why didnt you let them finish treating you on the surface
have you ever been to an alien hospital
yes in san francisco
well these people have never treated a human before i wanted my own doctor wheres phlox
hes not available
what do you mean hes not available
hes sleeping
well wake him up hes got a patient
the doctor is hibernating
hibernating for how long
just a couple of days dont worry i can handle a broken leg
he said he was having trouble breathing when we were in the pod
did they give you any medication
just a hypospray for the pain is something wrong
oh its probably nothing lets get you to sickbay
morning
i dont know if it was those risan maitais or getting shot but my heads killing me
it was probably both the suns up weve been down here all night
great our shore leaves half over hey we need some help down here hello
i already tried it clubs closed
i dont plan on spending our entire trip tied up in a basement
the vulcan database didnt mention anything about crime
they said it was very rare
what
it had some warnings but i didnt think itd be a problem
wonderful
you think this is my fault
you were willing to follow two strange aliens into a basement
gorgeous aliens dont forget they were gorgeous
they were male
not at first i dont remember twisting your arm
if we dont make it to the loading zone on time theyre going to start scanning for our biosigns do you want the captain to find us like this
i feel terrible
youre having a reaction to the painkiller they gave you
whats his condition
if the swelling gets any worse it could begin to constrict his airway
ive spoken to the hospital theyve never heard of a reaction like this but theyre not familiar with human physiology
i really think we should wake up doctor phlox
im sorry i give up i never thought that id hear a language i couldnt learn
dont feel bad youve only been trying for one day
it only took you one day to pick up english
it is much simpler and you are a very good primari
teacher
what do you call this
oh we dont have anything exactly like it the closest thing would be a strawberry
strawberry and this
it tastes like a kiwi what
in my language keehwi is er
what
i dont know the word may i show you
sure why not
keehwi
kiss thats called a kiss
a kiss theres a place i was planning to go today a steam pool they say its very relaxing would you like to go
avec plaisir thats french
what does it mean
good morning
good morning come in
i thought we could take our dogs to the beach if you dont have other plans
sounds great i just ordered breakfast would you like to join me
certainly
juice
please what are you reading
its a gift from my science officer her people think humans are too controlled by their emotions
i knew there was a reason i liked you
seems like you know a lot about me where im from what books i read i dont even know your dogs name
its rhylo i adopted her when she was a puppy anything else
everything else whats your planet called what do you do do you have a family
weve been having such a wonderful time i really dont want to spoil it
how could you spoil it
i did have a family they were killed my parents my brother my husband
im sorry
it was our own fault wed been warned about the suliban we should have gotten out while we had the chance
suliban
you know about them
yes
im not so sure this is a good idea
theres no need to whisper hes in a state of deep hibernation
yeah thats what im worried about
did you use the correct dosage
dosani dosani yoto aruda
phlox
i dont care what it tastes like
wake up doctor
subcommander has it been forty eight hours
no
then why did you wake me
theres a medical emergency
emergency then call the doctor
youre the doctor
of course whos sick
ensign mayweather
who
ensign mayweather our helmsman
i know who he is where is he
hes in sickbay
were not in sickbay
were in your quarters
well then to sickbay
i could use some assistance please
what seems to be the trouble captain
its travis doctor
hes having some kind of anaphylactic reaction
incredible
what
ive been standing up for almost five minutes
doctor
hand me that scanner captain
ah yes yes its definitely being caused by an antigenic compound in his system well need regulan blood worms
what
theyre excellent at filtering toxins
er which container are they in
no fresh ones would be better
set a course for regulus maximum warp
doctor i think this was a mistake you should return to your quarters
i appreciate the offer but it would be best to keep our relationship professional
lets go doctor
i am the chief medical officer on this ship and i am going to treat ensign mayweather then im going back to bed
this was waiting for me when i checked in compliments of the management i dont know anything about risan vintages but what do you say we throw caution to the wind and give it a try
ill be adventurous if you will
hows your ankle
its getting better
youd think that guide would have warned us
oh the water was very shallow i should have watched where i was stepping
i dont know that thing was pretty well camouflaged to risan sea turtles
its a little sweet for my taste
is something wrong
camouflaged we could only see them when they moved
was there more than one
im not talking about turtles you said you knew who they were have you seen them did they hurt anyone that you cared about
weve seen them a number of times but weve been lucky no one was badly hurt
how do you fight something you cant even see i was told that they take their orders from the future
is that right
all their genetic enhancements they were taught to do that by someone from the distant future
who told you that
its no secret theyve attacked dozens of ships settlements but where do they come from where do they live
i wish i could tell you but i dont know
what are they planning to do next
hopefully neither of us will ever run into them again
you know that isnt true they keep enlisting more of their people into the what do they call it the cabal you must know something about them jonathan
i realise that they murdered your family and im very sorry for that but im not sure what you want me to tell you
most of what i have learned about them has come from rumours and hearsay but you have seen them face to face i want you to tell me what you know where are their helixes where do they live
if this wine is too sweet i think theres another bottle here it might be different
youre the first person ive met in over a year whos had any contact with them
all right i dont know much but ill tell you what i can i could use some fresh air why dont we take a walk on the beach
thank you
its kind of chilly you might want to go get a sweater or something
ill be right back
archer to enterprise
this is tpol
im transmitting a bioscan to you run it through the computer i think youll find a match
you dont sound very relaxed captain
quickly please
understood
ready
not quite
your surgeons did a nice job all the tandarans i met had a very distinctive feature right here
tandarans i dont understand
i took a bioscan they may be able to change your face but not your dna did colonel grat send you
who
i suppose its possible you dont know him he ran the detention camp i was sent to it was filled with innocent suliban grat asked me the same questions youve been asking except he was a little more aggressive on the other hand he didnt try to win my sympathy with fictitious tragedies
youre wrong jonathan youre all wrong i think i should leave
if it wasnt grat then who was it who sent you here who was it
im sorry youve been very kind to me im going to check out now i cant have you interfering
whatever was in that bottle you broke got all over me it stinks to high heaven
its not like i had a choice we needed something to cut through those ropes
good morning
morning
sleep well
very
any thoughts about what youd like to do today risa has a lot to offer
i could spend the entire day right here but im afraid the shuttles coming to pick me up in a few hours
not a very long vacation
two days and two nights thats all we had
i hope you dont think that i
took advantage of me not for a minute
there we go
youre certain
you can check it yourself if you like doctor the analysis clearly shows he was given benzethonium chloride youre quite allergic to it this should do the trick
your biosigns are stabilising it seems to be working
how do you feel
a lot better thanks doc
whats that smell
i dont smell anything
im guessing you two had an interesting couple of days
fascinating culture sir what about you hoshi do anything constructive
as a matter of fact i learned several new conjugations
you look rested sir did you get a good nights sleep
went out like a light
next time we take shore leave instead of just sitting around reading books you should try to get out look for a little excitement meet new people
they dont have a problem with us dropping by
on the contrary the operations foreman said they havent had visitors in nearly six months
is it really a matriarchal society i mean the women make all the decisions
until recently but in the last decade the paraagan males have made great strides to acquire equal rights
still it would probably be best if we didnt get too flirtatious
probably i read that this colony started off twenty years ago with just thirty miners now there are over three thousand theyve got schools landscaped communities even some kind of museum
you think twenty years from now therell be earth colonies out this far human kids growing up on new sausalito
if my father were alive he wouldnt doubt it for a minute were making history with
every light year you know i think ive heard you say that at least half a dozen times
archer here
the paraagans have given us clearance to enter orbit
have you received their landing protocols
theyre coming in now
were on our way
this should take a bit longer than usual
it wouldnt be very polite to ignite their atmosphere when are you supposed to close the plasma ducts
the protocol said fifty kilometres but to be on the safe side im going to lock them off at about seventy five
although the matriarchal elements in the culture have diminished it might be best if i were to ask
enterprise to shuttlepod one captain archer please respond
did you see that
the shuttlepods attitude isnt right
im coming around bring the grappler online
hoshi
not yet now
i closed both plasma ducts im certain of it
are you sure theres nothing left
we could see the colony in full magnification sir the ground was scorched for at least a hundred kilometres in every direction
could one of the dampeners been malfunctioning
i closed both ducts any kind of malfunction would have triggered an alarm two alarms there are backups to prevent these kinds of accidents the ducts were closed
this is no time to be placing blame a thorough investigation should explain what happened how is he
he has a mild concussion but he should be fine
have you tried hailing the colony there has to be someone down there
sir i tried to explain theres nothing left no buildings no trees no people
thats impossible there were thirty six hundred colonists
have you finished the diagnostics
ive analysed six of the pod sensor logs i have two left
well get them done youve had three hours  what about the enterprise sensor logs they must have recorded how much tetrazine was in the atmosphere was the concentration greater than the paraagans specified was it present at higher altitudes than it was supposed to be
thats the weird part sir the tetrazine levels were less than three parts per million thats half what the protocol specified
what about the point of ignition
the flash point was directly beneath the shuttle sir but it seems to have originated at the starboard plasma duct
a plasma duct youre certain was closed
every log on the shuttle indicates that both ducts were sealed and locked
then youd better start reexamining those logs because something doesnt add up here get me admiral forrest this is not going to be fun
tetrazine
its a byproduct of their mining operation it settles between forty five and fifty kilometres in their atmosphere exhaust plasma is about the only thing hot enough to ignite it
but you said your plasma ducts were closed
yes sir were doing everything we can to determine what went wrong but thats not going to change the fact that there are thirty six hundred corpses down there
continue to analyse your logs im going to call an emergency meeting at the command council you realise theyll undoubtedly bring the vulcans into this well have to figure out whos going to contact the paraagan homeworld
that should be my responsibility sir
youre right it should but lets take this one step at a time
how do you tell all those families that
you followed all the protocols that you were given
we came here to meet these people to learn something about them not to kill them
you followed the protocols youve got a crew thats going to be looking to you to figure out how to react to all this dont let them down ill get back to you soon as i can im sorry jon
his behaviour has been erratic he seems to alternate between agitation despondency and guilt he spends most of his time alone ive tried to remind him that this was an accident but his responses have been illogical he seems to be ignoring his responsibilities as captain
ah to be vulcan its been my experience that humans have a great deal of difficulty separating emotional despair from what you call responsibility
nevertheless as his physician you should monitor him closely to be certain he remains fit for command
i understand how uncomfortable his behaviour must be for you but trust me it would be unnatural for the captain not to be affected by grief under these circumstances its er human nature hell be fine
what is it
its admiral forrest sir
thank you
the atmospheric analysis of the probe is coming through
put it up here would you
what is it
the air near the surface is filled with traces of borocarbons
when tetrazine is ignited by plasma exhaust theres only one outcome you can be sure of
traces of borocarbons
you got it
i dont care whether that probe picked up traces of bread pudding both our plasma ducts were locked down and there were no leaks in the system not unless they miraculously mended themselves afterwards
tpol trip
the missions been cancelled
cancelled
from what the admiral tells me ambassador soval will use this to convince starfleet that we need another ten or twenty years before we try this again
twenty years starfleet wont buy that for a minute
wont they
tell him hes crazy tell him thats guilt talking not jonathan archer
the vulcan ship will meet us in three days to get you and doctor phlox please inform mister mayweather to head for these coordinates
i cant believe youre letting them do this to us youve waited all your life to command this ship
dismissed
but sir
i said youre dismissed both of you
you think theyve replaced you in brazil yet
even if they have theyd take me back im a prodigy remember how about you
after a year on enterprise the thought of a cargo ship is pretty unappealing
what if they made you captain youre going to be the most famous boomer around you know
or maybe infamous from what commander tucker tells me people back home think that were doing nothing out here but getting in trouble
then its our job to let the people back home know what really happened anyone who tries to badmouth captain archer in front of me is going to get an earful in any language they want
lieutenant
over here its not exactly a smoking gun but this em signature does not belong here
where did you find it
on the outer hull about twelve centimetres below the starboard plasma duct
it might simply be borocarbons formed by the explosion
i already checked there isnt a carbon atom to be found whatever it is its profile doesnt match anything in our database
come in what was so important it couldnt wait till morning
if youd prefer ill come back
no im sorry what have you got
lieutenant reed and his team have discovered an unidentified em signature on the ventral hull of shuttlepod one
it could be anything
mister reed felt youd be interested
in what does he think that starfleet commands going to take a look at this apologise and send us on our way tell him it was a nice try
is this what humans refer to as feeling sorry for themselves
youre out of line subcommander
i apologise
i wish i was simply feeling sorry for myself but actually im feeling sorry for a whole lot of people every member of starfleet in fact their futures depended upon my ability to succeed at this mission
as soon as we learned about the consequences of the explosion i knew the vulcan high command would take advantage of the situation
whats your point
you have a responsibility to dispute their recommendation
starfleet already bought their recommendation hook line and sinker
then you have a responsibility to convince them as well
and how do you suggest i do that
you are very adept at listing the questionable decisions youve made but there have been other decisions many of them that no one would question im willing to try to convince my government of that are you willing to try to convince yours
you know this has got to be the first time a vulcan has ever attempted to cheer up a human
ill see you in the morning
thats all right commander your company is appreciated but it would be best if you left the packing to me
i would have thought youd be a little more upset about leaving enterprise
well i did expect this posting would last a while longer but im sure an equally adventurous opportunity will present itself
i wish i had your attitude
humans seem to be naturally optimistic im surprised you dont share my outlook that something exciting always waiting around the next nebula
thats just the point there wont be any nebulas in starfleets future at least not for a decade or so
oh i wouldnt be so sure of that
youre wrong doc you worked with vulcans you know what they think of us enterprise coming back to earth with its tail tucked between its legs itll be sovals crowning achievement theyll probably give the son of a bitch some gaudy medal and then cart him off to wherever they send bitter old vulcans to retire
ambassador sovals service record contains an impressive list of accomplishments
you have to find something good in everybody dont you i got to tell you thats one of your unique qualities that drives me crazy
ill certainly miss your outspoken personality mister tucker
ill see you later doc
come on porthos time for bed
porthos up whats the matter boy dont tell me youre
porthos whats going on here  hello
sorry to call so late captain but all three inspection pods are getting their weekly overhauls tonight they tell me they wont be ready till noon so i figured you might want to sleep in
might want to sleep in what do you say to breakfast at nine thirty spacedock cafeteria
you must be reading my mind i was just about to suggest the same thing
see you in the morning  if youre trying to tell me the last ten months was a dream im not buying it
ime can i help you
this is captain jonathan archer starfleet authorisation alpha six four
i know who you are captain what can i do for you
do you have a denobulan doctor in the interspecies medical exchange
yes a doctor phlox hes assigned to starfleet medical here in san francisco would you like me to contact him for you
no thats all right thanks for your help
i didnt even know phlox existed before they brought klaang in and that was the day after the late night call from trip
youre not dreaming captain
daniels
this must be very disorienting i apologise but i had no choice
commander tucker told me you were dead that silik killed you
he did in a manner of speaking we have to talk captain and its essential that none of the other factions know about it i doubt any of them would think id bring you here
so youre telling me you brought me back what ten months ago how about jonathan archer ten months ago wheres he
hes you
then who just climbed into bed aboard enterprise
that hasnt happened yet
thats a load of crap and you know it
ive had this same conversation with half a dozen people it always ends up the same way
cant you ever give a straight answer
it depends on the question
all right try this one why am i here i thought you were supposed to protect the timeline not screw with it
its already been screwed with captain that explosion at the paraagan colony it wasnt supposed to happen
of course it wasnt it was an accident
thats not what i mean history never recorded the disaster someone violated the temporal accord someone who doesnt want your mission to succeed
are you telling me that enterprise didnt cause that explosion
do you remember the temporal cold war i spoke of
its kind of hard to forget
then listen to me carefully we dont have much time
all senior staff report to the situation room in fifteen minutes mister reed id like you in my quarters immediately
it was just where we detected the em signature but i dont understand it was completely invisible how on earth did you know that a phasediscriminator would expose it
if im not mistaken youll find this thing was designed to generate a plasma stream put a team together trip ill need two quantum beacons theyll have to be positronbased and have an output of two hundred gigawatts apiece
positronbased sir
just get started ill bring you the specs in a few minutes were going to need our comm frequencies on the fritz for a day or so see to it
aye sir
put the armoury on full alert turn the ship around travis were going back to the paraagan colony what are you all waiting for
sir
it wasnt us trip we didnt do it
take a look at the dispersal curve here and here youll have to isolate the subassembly tolerances from the emitter algorithms
whoa hold on a minute youre saying the assemblys independent of the emitters
exactly
thats impossible
not if you generate a stable flux between the positron conductors then all youll have to do is renormalise the tertiary wave functions
with all due respect sir this is a level of quantum engineering thats beyond anything i ever learned how the hell do you know this
remember crewman daniels
yeah i saw him get vaporised by our friend silik
well for a cloud of vapour hes one wealth of information i just spent two hours with him
hes on enterprise
not exactly listen ill explain later right now weve got to get back to building these beacons
whatever you say
the circuitry in there isnt compatible with our technology well have to create an interface
what for
were going to be retrieving some suliban data discs i have no doubt youll be able to handle the content but before you can do that well have to find a way to access the data
and daniels claims this is suliban technology
everything hes told me has checked out so far i have no reason to doubt him this
well do our best captain
captain the vulcan ship we were headed for its no doubt detected weve altered course
have they tried to hail us
i wouldnt know sir our comm is on the fritz
why did daniels leave it in his quarters
i dont recall him having much time to pack before he left
no well if it is there and it contains what he said it does it could be invaluable to starfleet
i gave daniels my word malcolm we download the schematics for the suliban stealth cruiser nothing else
pity assuming hes right and we manage to find the cruiser what makes you think the suliban wont come after us
just like those old bible movies malcolm it wasnt written
so far daniels is batting a thousand
wait a minute did you see that theyve got schematics on half a dozen different klingon ships
the stealth cruiser lieutenant nothing else
there there it is
trip
i feel like a chef whos just made a meal with ingredients hes never tasted
you follow the instructions
to the letter
bridge to captain archer
go ahead
were approaching the colony
have mister mayweather locate a binary system two point five light years away and set a course
understood
lets get these mounted on the grappler arms
head for the smaller star then the inner moon of the second planet
bridge to armoury
reed here
have you plotted all the target points
aye sir
stand by
ill meet you two in the launch bay  if this goes well i shouldnt be long  lower the beacons  modify the viewscreen bring up these coordinates full magnification
activate the beacons
right where theyre supposed to be
arent we in range of their sensors sir
they can see us but they have no idea we can see through their cloak just keep on the same course travis malcolm
the closer the better sir
theyre charging weapons
now mister reed
their cloaking generators down
all four weapon banks as well
port and starboard engines disabled
okay heres the tricky part
reed to shuttlepod two
archer here
shes all yours captain good luck
that last shot should have sealed off the two lower decks if daniels is right there shouldnt be more than twenty suliban for us to deal with
is that all
the stun grenades on a threesecond delay
just ten more metres
go
which one
here
go
captain theyre all around us
archer to reed
go ahead
we need some help here
i see them youd better take cover
go
whats the problem
i cant release the docking clamps
ignite the thrusters go to full power
archer to mayweather
we see you captain
set a course back ward the vulcan ship go to warp four as soon as were aboard
yes sir
it took a while before we realized that the three discs had to work in unison the interface seems to be holding
hoshi
the stealth cruiser was definitely in orbit of the paraagan colony when the explosion took place they were monitoring us very closely there are sensors logs that tracked our course our altitude even our hull temperature look at these
i cant believe how close they got
they got a lot closer than you think
those cloaking devices sure come in handy
they were docked with the shuttlepod for nearly two minutes
just long enough to attach this and cloak it good work keep at it get me admiral forrest
sounds like pretty solid evidence where the hell did you get it
its all on three data discs we took from a cloaked suliban cruiser
but how did you know about that cruiser and if it was cloaked how could you find it
ive got friends in high places
this is going to be a very interesting debriefing get to the vulcan ship as quickly as you can ill let them know what youve got i cant tell you how pleased i am jonathan after all youve done i would have hated to see this end
thank you for believing in us admiral archer out
they boarded a cloaked vessel and they knew exactly where to find the discs
they werent acting alone
my ships are fast we can overtake them and destroy enterprise
have your ships bring me archer allow enterprise to continue
but we need to recover the discs
archer you know what happened the last time you failed me
it was ten months ago he brought me back ten months but i knew everything i know now how is that possible
as ive told you the vulcan science directorate has concluded that time travel is impossible
well good for the vulcan science directorate maybe they can tell me how i woke up yesterday knowing exactly where that suliban ship was or how i suddenly had the ability to construct a quantum beacon to see through its cloak and while theyre at it they might as well tell me how i knew where to find those discs
all valid questions but to conclude that the only answer is that you acquired this information from a dead crewman who transported you back through time is illogical
why dont you give me another explanation
i cant
because there isnt one i got a call from trip something about inspection pods it was the exact same call i got the day before they found klaang word for word
perhaps you were dreaming
listen i never thought this was possible either but i travelled through time and i need you to believe me
why
because its hard enough trying to fathom all this without having my science officer a colleague who i trust and rely on the person who got me to stop feeling sorry for myself accusing me of being an hallucinating madman
i dont remember accusing you of anything
bridge to archer
yes
were getting some strange readings sir it might not be a bad idea for you to come out here
ive taken the liberty of asking commander tucker to join us
whats the problem
were having trouble balancing the warp field
looks okay to me
its odd itll be stable one moment and then for no reason itll go slightly out of alignment
what are you guys doing to my engines
the autostabilisers arent functioning properly
the computer ran its last diagnostic on them less than ten minutes ago they look fine
well theyre not weve had to realign the field a dozen times over the last hour
load torpedoes and stand by all weapons deploy the beacons travis modify the viewscreen and aim the beacons aft
swing them down slowly
it looks like were in a swarm of cloaked bees
charge the phase cannons
were being hailed
put it through
i wouldnt advise using your weapons jonathan perhaps if we decloak youll understand why
malcolm
theyre all armed with highyield particle weapons sir
how many could you take out
before they open fire not enough sir
one of my ships is approaching your starboard docking port id like you to board it immediately
what do you want with me
you have five minutes if you dont comply i have permission to destroy enterprise
how do i know you wont destroy enterprise either way
you have my word captain and you also have four and a half minutes left
im placing you in command i advise you to maintain your present course and speed i dont know whats going to happen but try to keep an open mind especially when it comes to things the vulcan science directorate says are impossible
ill try
captain this is crazy how do you know what theyre going to do
tpols in command now trip do whatever you n to help her that goes for all of you  keep an eye on porthos for me would you remember no cheese
your captains playing a very dangerous game subcommander
game
he has thirty seconds left did he think i wasnt serious
the turbolifts on e deck its empty
where is he
im not reading his biosigns he must be on the suliban ship
captain archer is no longer aboard enterprise perhaps you should check with the vessel you sent for him
i thought he was smarter than this he could have saved all your lives what a waste
the docked ship is moving away
its targeting our warp core theyre all targeting the warp core
ten minutes ago that vista was more beautiful than anything you could imagine
where am i
i had breakfast in that room less than half an hour ago then i was instructed to bring you here they told me that the timeline wouldnt be safe if you boarded that suliban ship someone was very mistaken
where is here
youre in the thirty first century captain or whats left of it
you said the suliban wouldnt follow us that wed make it safely to the vulcan ship
as far as i was told that was exactly what was supposed to occur
so youre telling me this just happened it doesnt look like it just happened
no it looks like it happened a long time ago
if bringing me here caused this then send me back ill take my chances with silik
you dont understand all our equipment the time portals have been destroyed everythings been destroyed theres no way to send you back
hes not on board you must have sensors that can confirm that
youve lied to me before if you dont tell me where he is ill have no alternative but to
come see for yourself or send your soldiers youll realise im telling the truth
drop out of warp and prepare to be boarded
security teams to docking ports one two and three
this is subcommander tpol all security teams remain where you are
are you crazy how do we know how many suliban are coming aboard they could try to take over the ship
there are thirty armed vessels surrounding us unless im mistaken their weapons are still targeting our warp core mister reed so unless you have a better suggestion
if this place was destroyed as long ago as it seems to have been then what are you doing here you and your watchdog buddies dont exactly fit in with all this
youre thinking of time travel like were in some hg wells novel were not its far more complicated theres no way for you to understand
try me listen i realise your little utopia is gone and i sympathise but if youre telling me the truth if youve brought me eight hundred years into the future into this future i think i deserve some answers
i dont have any answers and youre right i shouldnt be here which means you shouldnt be here either but you are we are we brought you here to protect the time line we did quite a job
whats wrong
its gone
whats gone
the monument it was right here on the same street as the library it was obviously never built
why is that a problem who did it commemorate
not who
then what
an organisation the federation it doesnt exist for you not yet
but it will fine keep your missing monument to yourself wheres this library you were talking about
it should be right down there if it was ever built and even it was it will be of no help all the datas stored electronically
books made with paper there arent supposed to be books here
well there are so i suggest we use some of them to figure out what you did to the last thousand years when you brought me here this morning
they havent been duplicated
is he correct
dont you believe your scanners
is he correct
we didnt have time to make a copy
leave her alone
lower your weapon  if we find captain archer aboard this vessel youll all be punished for lying to me
hes not here unless hes dead but we did find this
where
in that lift its an hour old maybe two
when i saw him last your captain spoke of a temporal cold war what was he talking about
captain archer believed crewman daniels was from the future but if i recall you killed him
what else
nothing else
theres a temporal signature in your turbolift what do you know of that
the last time we saw captain archer he was entering that turbolift
perhaps you havent been lying to me  you shut down all comm systems and computer terminals with the exception of engineering and the bridge confine all of them to their quarters if anyone resists
understood
under the circumstances it would be best to do what he says commander
theyre three days overdue
i told you ambassador archer said he was returning with proof that they werent responsible for the tragedy on paraagan two
you also told me starfleet had ordered him to deliver subcommander tpol and his medical officer to the vulcan ship dkyr theyre three days overdue
the dkyr has long range sensors have they detected enterprise
captain archers negligence caused the death of three thousand colonists your superiors instructed them to return to earth their mission is over they havent followed those instructions
you didnt answer the commanders question has your ship detected enterprise
the dkyr said they were joined by a number of other vessels theyre no longer within sensor range
what kind of vessels
they were at too great a distance to identify enterprise has ignored our hails and defied starfleets orders i have no choice but to send the dkyr in pursuit
jonathan archer doesnt report to you
no he doesnt but subcommander tpol does and since she would never comply with his present actions i have to conclude that shes being held against her will
i know you dont think much of archer ambassador but he is not in the habit of kidnapping vulcans
fine you send your ship whatever archers up to im sure hes got a good reason he knows what hes doing
does he really
have you cycled through the subtemporal harmonics
hes never failed to respond before
perhaps hes angry that we didnt return with archer
archer wasnt on enterprise why isnt he responding i need instructions
he said to destroy enterprise if we couldnt bring him archer we should tow them out of the nebula and do it now
that temporal signature it changes everything if archer was pulled through time we need new instructions where is he
if hes angry with you youll be punished again we should destroy enterprise
have the surgeons prepare then bring me the vulcan
i havent found a single reference to this federation you talked about
i doubt you will
because that monument wasnt there
because you werent there
so i disappear one day and all history changes
ive looked through the twenty first and twenty second centuries everything looks right up until the warp five programme after that nothing looks right
there were a lot of people involved in the warp five programme
we didnt bring a lot of people here this morning we just brought you
the romulan star empire whats that
maybe you shouldnt be reading that
i dont get it what could i have done that could have been so important
it wasnt just you it was events you helped set in motion
this timeline the one you say no longer exists what can you tell me about it if my mission had continued
it would have led to others
and  okay what about this federation was earth part of it was i part of it
silik wanted you not the data disks the people he answered to were more interested in capturing jonathan archer than in blaming enterprise for the destruction of the colony they obviously knew what role you were going to play in the months or years to come by taking you away from the twenty second century i caused exactly what i was trying to prevent
youve lost me
the only chance i have of restoring my century is by getting you back to yours
sounds like youve got a chickenortheegg problem you said your time portals are gone all your technology there isnt even electricity here you going to find a bicycle turn it into a time machine
maybe we dont need a time machine do you have your communicator
and my scanner
may i the people the suliban were working for came from about three hundred years ago they couldnt travel through time but they did develop a way to send back images of themselves to communicate through time
you cant do that with those
no its a little bit more complicated but not much we learned how to do it in high school but were going to need a few things that might not be too easy to find
what are we waiting for
where is archer
i dont know
who are you working with from the future
the vulcan science directorate has determined that time travel is impossible
does captain archer agree with that opinion
its not an opinion
does archer agree with that determination
captain archer believes crewman daniels comes from the future
but daniels is dead
captain archer claims he saw daniels two days ago
your captain is gone did daniels take him into the past or the future
the vulcan science directorate has determined that time travel is impossible
i cant be sure but i think thats copper
well done i need you to unwrap it and pound it into small strips no more than a millimetre thick
hello please repeat i cant understand i still cant understand you try modulating the subcarrier wave
malcolm can you hear me
barely youre going to need to boost the signal
any better
yeah
i thought the comm was offline
it is im routing the signal through the eps grid i can talk to any doorbell on b deck
are you all right
same as you i guess locked in tight
and the others
i cant get in contact with tpol for some reason
and hoshi and travis are on c deck
any thoughts about how were going to get rid of these suliban
one step at a time the first thing i need to do is figure out how to tap into the door comms
on cdeck ill get back to you sit tight
i wasnt planning on going anywhere
any luck
i still have the spatial coordinates of enterprise but without a quantum discriminator its going to be very tricky to contact the ship on the same day you left
i thought you built these things in high school
where quantum discriminators were on every desk
why is the same day so important what would be wrong with making contact a week before i left or even a month before
i made the biggest mistake in the history of time travel this morning i dont intend to make it any worse
this is captain archer can you hear me tpol this is captain archer can you hear me
i dont think its working
i dont know where he is
you dont know where who is subcommander this is captain archer im having trouble understanding you
captain archers gone a temporal reading in the turbolift i dont know where he is
daniels brought me to the future thats what the temporal reading was all about are you all right
science vulcan directorate has determined that time travel is not fair
whatever you say just tell me are you all right
were all confined to our quarters
where are you
i told you in my quarters
no i mean enterprise wheres enterprise
theres a helix out my window
tpol listen to me i need your help youre going to have to find a way to get to daniels quarters do you understand me
youre on the ceiling why arent you on a monitor
theres no technology where i am
i thought you said you were in the future
tpol do you remember when i asked you to keep an open mind
yes
theres a lot more at stake here than bringing me back or the mission i need you to listen to me very carefully i need you to trust me
it wont work we can only access the decoupling pins from outside our quarters
so if we cant pick the locks what about the shafts that house the eps conduits
theyre adjacent to the air ducts
they were pretty much blocked off when the ship was completed
it would be too tight a squeeze
whats your definition of too tight
well you or i couldnt get through them
maybe a child or
or hoshi
its possible but it would be difficult
what do you say hoshi
you willing to give it a try
isnt there some other way that i can help out something that needs translating you know how claustrophobic i am
theres no one else that can get through those crawlspaces unless we could reach crewman naiman
shes pretty small
theres no time if this is going to work we need to begin now ensign sato
how far would i have to go to get to the doctors quarters
forty metres maybe forty five
then how far to lieutenant reeds
its not that far hoshi
you can do it we need you to do it
hoshi
good guess
how are you holding up
great if you dont mind id just like to get this over with
good luck
whatever youre about to say i dont want to hear it just get me a shirt
third dimension timeline timeline first second
what are you doing
first third dimension
stand up vulcan up
no no no
no stop
you certainly took your time he had this pressed against my head
had to be sure they were preoccupied you positive youre willing to do this it could get pretty ugly
im positive
youve got thirty minutes
good luck
if they regain consciousness dont hesitate to use these
dont worry
lets go
did you think we wouldnt be watching daniels quarters
i guess i wasnt thinking
i guess you werent but you should be thinking now thinking about what will happen to you if you dont answer my questions are you thinking about that lieutenant reed good now tell me what this is what does it do
i dont know
what does it do
i dont know please
yes
i was told to destroy it i dont know what it does
who told you to destroy it
captain archer before he left he didnt want you to find it
and why would that be
he thought you would use it to contact someone i dont know who i swear it
have the lieutenant returned to his quarters
ready
engineering how did this happen engineering
what is it
the antimatter stream has been compromised
shut down the warp reactor
our engineers arent responding ive sent soldiers
keep me informed
yes
these humans are greater fools than i thought
theyd rather commit mass suicide than submit to us
did you correct the problem
its too late the reactors going to breach
we cant endanger the helix evacuate your soldiers and have enterprise towed out of the nebula
theres very little time will you alert the tractor teams
you do it im busy
is that you can you hear me
report ensign
the antimatter streams back to normal
you may have overdone your pyrotechnic display the scorching on the starboard nacelle is extensive
ill try to remember that next time we have to fake a reactor breach
cell ships thirty of them thirty five approaching at high warp
maintain your course and speed ensign
ive tried to reach you i tried for two days i did what you told me but archer wasnt on enterprise there was some kind of temporal signature i need instructions i dont know how to operate this device i need your help  i hear you but i dont understand repeat what you said please repeat what you said
i said youre an ugly bastard
you try shapeshifting on me or pulling one of your chameleon routines and i promise you silik ill blow your head off has enterprise left the nebula
can you see ive brought you archer hes here archers here theres no need to punish me
wheres my ship silik
theyve left theyre gone
how many cell ships did you send after them silik
i dont know twenty thirty
youre going to call them off and then youre going to give me those data discs back now get up
my soldiers wont let you leave
shut up
get going
hoshi any sign of the vulcan ship
not yet
hull plating on the portaft quarters down
alter course ten degrees starboard
theyre closing
the lead ships are overtaking us
port hull platings down ventral plating as well
whyd they stop firing
why waste ammunition they have us surrounded
are longrange sensors still operational
no vulcan ship
subcommander
i see them
son of a bitch he did it
one cell ship approaching aft
stand down weapons open a channel enterprise to suliban vessel
go ahead enterprise
good to hear your voice captain
good to hear yours too i feel like ive been away for a thousand years
is everyone all right
lieutenant reed suffered some minor injuries but hes recovering in sickbay captain im curious why didnt the other cell ships try to stop you
i know its not standard starfleet procedure
but i took a hostage
by the time he wakes up well be long gone
request permission to dock
permission granted
while your explanation of how you obtained these disks is somewhat implausible its obvious that enterprise was not responsible for the destruction of the colony
it may see somewhat implausible to you but
please allow me to finish captain in less than a single earth year youve engaged in armed conflicts with over a dozen species youve escalated the conflict between my people and the andorians which included the destruction of one of our most sacred monasteries you helped eighty nine suliban escape from detention you may claim to be on a mission of exploration i however consider you reckless and irresponsible
a danger to the quadrant regardless of the evidence presented here i plan to advise the vulcan high command not to change its recommendation to starfleet enterprise should be recalled
you guys have wanted to scrub this mission from day one we proved to you that we didnt kill those thirty six hundred people but you dont want to hear it youre pathetic
thats enough commander
no ones more pleased than i am that enterprise wasnt responsible for the tragedy but ambassador sovals argument may be valid starfleet command has a difficult decision to make here
when i was in my early twenties on a trip to east africa i saw a gazelle giving birth it was truly amazing within minutes the baby was standing up standing up on its own a few more minutes and it was walking and before i knew it it was running alongside its mother moving away with the herd humans arent like that ambassador we may come from the same planet as those gazelles but were pretty much helpless when were born it takes us months before were able to crawl almost a full year before we can walk our deep space mission isnt much different were going to stumble make mistakes im sure more than a few before we find our footing but were going to learn from those mistakes thats what being human is all about im sorry you cant see that
your analogy is very colourful captain but i question whether it addresses the consequences of your actions
the concept of learning from ones mistakes shouldnt be difficult for a vulcan of your wisdom to understand ambassador our ancestors
discovered how to suppress their volatile emotions only after centuries of savage conflict you spoke of the destruction of the monastery what about the vulcan listening post that captain archer found there i would hope that our people have learned from those events that using a sacred sanctuary to spy on others was a dishonourable practice to say the least i dont wish to contradict captain archer but learning from ones mistakes is hardly exclusive to humans their mission should be allowed to continue
the command council will review the evidence and listen to whats been said here today im sure theyll hear from the vulcans as well ill let you know as soon as theres a decision good luck jonathan all of you
come in
i cant be certain but crewman fuller might have seen me coming in here
she tends to be discreet what can i do for you
i think you put it over the top forrest said none of the others could believe it when you went to bat for us not to mention that little listeningpost lecture you gave to soval
you spoke to the admiral
he woke me up in the middle of the night can you believe that
i assume with good news
i think you put it over the top
i still dont believe in time travel
the hell you dont
say when
when
i didnt know you drank wine
under the circumstances ill allow myself a small indulgence
make mine a large indulgence
to our science officer its been one year to the day since you officially joined our crew
heres to many more
i appreciate the sentiment but im simply carrying out my assignment
thats no small accomplishment considering the previous record for a vulcan serving on a human ship was two weeks
ten days
ive been filling out your annual crew evaluation just a formality
i understand the high command has requested my evaluation of you just a formality
theres something in your record ive been meaning to ask you about while you were stationed in sausalito you took a fiveday leave
yes
you went to an old mining town in pennsylvania carbon creek seems like an odd place to take a vacation
vulcans dont take vacations
then if i may ask whyd you go there
is this part of my evaluation
just curious
it was a personal matter
you had a personal matter in carbon creek pennsylvania
trip if she doesnt want to tell us
seems a little unfair we tell her plenty of stories
youd like me to tell you a story
if its a good one
i went to carbon creek because i wanted to visit the site of first contact between humans and vulcans
then you were about three thousand kilometres off that took place in montana
actually it didnt
every school kid knows that zephram cochrane met the vulcans in bozeman montana on april 5th 2063 ive been there theres a statue
in fact the vulcans visited earth long before then my second foremother was one of them
your who
my mothers mothers mother would you like to hear the story
i cant compensate
the refusion pressure is still dropping
if our orbit decays any further well be detected
theyd gone to earth to investigate the launch of its first artificial satellite called sputnik
during their third week of gathering information about humanity their impulse manifold began to malfunction they had no choice but to attempt an emergency landing
try to find an isolated area send a distress call to the high command
one hundred kilometres
deploy the stabilisers
our landing vector is too steep
are you hurt
i dont think so captain
what are your orders
why did the vulcans keep this a secret
the incident is welldocumented at the science directorate and the space council
on vulcan
of course
hang on tmir was your greatgrandmother id be the last person to question your math but arent you missing a few generations sputnik was two hundred years ago
dont forget how long vulcans live
right just how old are you
its got to be in her record
trip thats classified information please go on
their subspace transceiver was damaged in the crash they had no way of knowing if their distress signal had even been transmitted
theyd used up their emergency rations within a week after five days without food their situation was growing desperate
two lifeforms
fascinating
one of those creatures could sustain us for some time
are you suggesting we eat it
its logical to take extreme measures to survive
even resorting to savagery
that may not be necessary our scans showed a settlement approximately six kilometres away
if were exposed we could contaminate their culture
and when they find our bodies after we starve will that contaminate their culture
better to leave them with a mystery than with three living aliens
we should at least investigate the possibilities
its too dangerous
im willing to take the risk
mestral  remain here
how do you suggest we proceed
well need to disguise ourselves
were here to find food nothing else well keep contact with the humans to an absolute minimum if we must interact with them i will speak
what is it
i believe you have that garment on backwards
prisoners
they dont appear to be restrained more likely labourers
its hard to believe these people were capable of launching an artificial satellite
and he gets the sigh and heres the pitch dixon hits a scorcher down the right field line the first baseman takes a stab at it but no ellis is charging hard from right field he scoops it up and fires its going to be close theres a collision at the plate but wilcox hangs on to the ball and thompson is out
some type of combat no doubt
i believe it may be an entertainment
a communal gathering place
do they have food
it appears so remember
i wont speak
another
no ill settle up
all right
im next
currency
yes the paper appears to have value
thanks billy  what can i get you
do you have anything that doesnt require currency
you mean free
what brings you to carbon creek
we had an accident with our vehicle outside your town
are you okay
were fine
you folks married
no were business associates
theres a gas station up the road id be happy to give you a lift
no thank you
suit yourself
anybody up for a game quarter a ball
ill play
you better ask your mother jackie
come on mom we could use the money
go on upstairs and do your homework ill bring you up some dinner
im up for a game
what are you doing i told you not to speak to anyone
i can defeat him
you dont even know the rules
its simple
i thought you didnt have any money
he doesnt
well sorry pal theres nothing in it for me
its time for us to go
wait a minute we might be able to work something out if you win ill pay up if i win your business associate has a drink with me
we accept your terms
we do not
the game is based on simple geometry it wouldnt challenge a vulcan child
no
we need their currency
what if you lose ill have to socialise with him
would you rather die of starvation
tough break
the number eight ball in that pocket
cryogenics
l do you suppose theyve experimented with protein replicators
why didnt you ask the merchant you seemed willing to engage everyone else in conversation
i think that wines gone to your head
what are you implying
two vulcans stroll into a bar hustle a few games of pool and walk out with an armload of tv dinners it sounds like an old episode of the twilight zone
if youre not interested in hearing the rest
hold on hold on we didnt say we werent interested
they realised they couldnt rely on gambling
so they took whatever employment they could find while they waited for the rescue vessel to arrive
but as the weeks passed it seemed less likely that their distress call had been received and it became more difficult for them to avoid the humans
the test of a nuclear device is designed for tactical use in place of artillery zero hour was just after five
nothing like an atomic test to make your day
doesnt it concern you
the bomb it scares the hell out of me
id hate to see humanity destroy itself
that makes two of us
want to shoot some eight ball
jack
ive got a geometry midterm next week its good practice
nice try but theres better ways to prepare for a math test
are you interested in mathematics
its what i want to study at college mechanical engineering if i get to go
you will he got a scholarship
only a partial one
its still a scholarship and you worked hard for it everybodys been pitching in to help pay for his expenses books room and board
you can shoot one rack and thats it
your break
this is the third time this week ive had to fix mrs garretts sink
perhaps she enjoys your company
it might be tolerable if her son didnt insist on calling me moe
why does he do that
there is a comic actor known as a stooge with that name the boy believes we have similar hair
there is a resemblance
this is intolerable im a warp field engineer
then perhaps you can help me construct a subspace transceiver
i told you its impossible
if we remain here well die this worlds on the brink of selfannihilation
i dont believe that
because your fascination with this species is blinding you you sit for hours each day in front of this idiotic device
im doing research perhaps if you spent more time observing human behaviour you might not have such a pessimistic view of them
open your eyes they revel in violence they devote what little technology they have to devising ways of killing each other
so did we centuries ago they just havent realised their potential yet
what potential
they have great empathy and compassion look how weve been made to feel welcome
only because they believe were human if they discovered the truth do you think theyd be so compassionate where are you going
to the ship
why
this antenna is inadequate i believe i can use a waveform discriminator to enhance it
itll be safer to go after dark you cant risk being followed
i need to go now i love lucy is on tonight
hi youre right on time
it was different than seeing it on television more invigorating
well theres another game next week if youd like to go or we could do something else take in a movie
that would be enjoyable
can i ask you a question
yes
what are you hiding under that cap a pointed head youre not from mars are you
oh i didnt mean to make fun of you
im not offended may i ask you a question
please
what happened to your mate
you mean my husband
yes
he left a long time ago jack used to get letters from him every now and then the last we heard hed moved to phoenix i was hoping he would help with jacks college but i guess were on our own i can understand why he wouldnt want to have anything to do with me but im sorry im usually better at keeping a lid on my emotions its not always easy
i know
well im due back at the pine tree will i see you later
please i was simply surprised it was very pleasant
pleasant
wasnt that an appropriate response
well its been a while since i kissed a man but still i was hoping itd be a little bit more than pleasant
i did say very pleasant
weve got company
i should go thank you again
waveform discriminator
i went to a baseball game in doylestown
more research
maggie invited me i didnt think it would be a problem
then why did you lie about it
because i knew you wouldnt understand
you were engaging in intimate activity
i didnt initiate it
youre to have no further contact with that woman
you cant make that decision
im still in command
command of what our mission is over its time to accept the fact that we may never leave this world
i was just going to play some pool i didnt mean to bother you what are you doing
i was about to meditate
really are you just trying to clear your mind or reach a higher spiritual plane i spend a lot of time at the library
studying meditation techniques
different things mostly about places id like to visit like tibet the buddhist monks there meditate every day and in india theyre got these mystics called fakirs supposedly they can almost stop their hearts just by using willpower
youd be surprised what a disciplined mind can accomplish what else do you study at this library
astronomy literature sometimes ill just pick a book off the shelf and start reading what about you what do you like to read
i have an interest in astronomy as well
oh really did you know that minutes after dusk when the sun is just right you can see sputnik with the naked eye maybe tomorrow i could show you
ive seen it already
oh its amazing dont you think well ill let you get back to your meditating it was nice talking to you
and you
mestral
hello
hey i got tickets to the ball game this weekend its a doubleheader tims going gavin jack maggie
im afraid i cant
whats wrong with you lately maggie says you havent even
are you all right billy
yeah
why do you need us here
im looking for a particle weapon the armoury case help me find it
why
theres been an accident in the mine at least twenty men are trapped it could take the humans days to free them
we cant interfere
theyll die youd let them suffocate even if we could prevent it
what if they see the weapon
well be certain they dont
at best these humans only live to be sixty or seventy is it worth the risk just to extend their lives a few more years
we cant contaminate their culture
this has nothing to do with contamination it has to do with compassion
compassion is an emotion
theyre my friends and im going to help them dont try to stop me
yes
proceed twenty two metres then turn right at the junction
understood
in eight metres youll find a narrow opening near the ground that leads to an abandoned shaft
i think were getting more guys down there
is the ride free up there
yeah
theres a stratum of quartz on the wall opposite the opening
i see it
set your dispersal radius to seven degrees
two more metres
how far
approximately thirty metres
here over here
after rescuing the twelve miners mestral became something of a hero that day
didnt people wonder how he got them out
im sure they did but no one ever discovered the truth three months passed
and just as they had resigned themselves to the fact that in all likelihood they would never leave earth
tmir
this is captain tellus of vulcan survey vessel dvahl im responding to your distress signal
we thought it wasnt transmitted
your signal was picked up by a tellarite freighter it took them some time to forward it to the high command were approaching the system now meet us at the crash site in three days
understood
i hear youre leaving
thats correct
where to
home up north
im going to miss you youre about the most interesting people ive met in this town
im sure youll meet a lot of interesting people at college
im not going
what why not
we couldnt come up with the rest of the money the deadline for the tuitions friday so
what will you do
keep saving i guess find a job mom doesnt want me anywhere near the mine but thats where the work is around here
can you try again next year for the scholarship
ill reapply but theres no guarantee
im sure they will offer it to you again
and if not theres always the library still a lot of books i havent read good luck up north carbon creeks not exactly a vacation spot but i hope youll come visit us
perhaps
he took those college boards got the highest score of anybody in the county its not fair
so youre the lady with the invention thats going to change the world
morning
jack jack
didnt you terminate your employment
yes but i promised mrs garrett id repair this suction device
its unfortunate that youll be leaving these people without experiencing one thing they have to offer
such as alcohol frozen fish sticks the constant threat of nuclear annihilation
theres much more to them you just refuse to see it
ive seen enough
i havent i plan to stay here
if this is your attempt at humour
theyre on the verge of countless social and technological advancements i have the unique opportunity to study an emerging species
thats what youve done much closer than we anticipated your duty is to return to vulcan and report your findings
theres still more to learn about these people
all of them or just one
this has nothing to do with maggie she has helped me appreciate their culture but i dont intend to remain in carbon creek
where would you go
to one of their larger cities at first after that im not certain theres so much to see
the high command will never allow it tell him its not possible tmir
perhaps i can arrange for you to be on the next survey ship
in another twenty years running more statistical scans from high orbit thats not enough
where is your captain
he was killed in the crash
there were four vulcans aboard your vessel
mestral died in the crash as well we cremated their remains
do you realise youve just rewritten our history books
a footnote at best
footnote this is like finding out neil armstrong wasnt the first man to walk on the moon
perhaps he wasnt
how long did this mestral stay on earth
the rest of his life presumably
and that would be what another hundred hundred and fifty years
possibly longer
an alien is left on earth in the 1950s lives through what thirty presidents travels the world and no one notices him and what happened when he finally kicked the bucket did the undertaker just shrug and ignore his ears
you asked me to tell you a story
and it was a good one but did it really happen
as i said you asked me to tell you a story
damn captain she put one over on us
you did go to carbon creek
if you check my record youll note that i also visited yellowstone park and the carlsbad caverns im a scientist that includes geology thank you for the meal
my pleasure youve certainly kept us entertained
good night
come in
good morning
captain
sleep well
well enough
i wasnt sure what you wanted for breakfast so i took the liberty of having chef prepare his famous eggs benedict
thatll be fine sir
you plan to eat standing up
this isnt a visit to the principals office malcolm at ease
thank you sir i just wasnt sure whether you called me here to discuss something
no no business i just wanted to have a long overdue meal with my armoury officer
i heard that england made it to the finals in the world cup
i beg your pardon
the world cup soccer
oh im afraid i dont much follow football sir
any sports you do follow
no not particularly
thanks
youre welcome sir
ive been working on the duty roster sir we only have two crewmen assigned to the armoury fulltime if we added a third ensign tanner would be free to begin those upgrades to those torpedo launchers i told you about
didnt your mother ever tell you not to bring your homework to the table
sir
this looks fine  archer
im sorry to interrupt captain but weve detected an uncharted system along our present course one of the planets is minsharaclass
take us out of warp im on my way looks like well have to reschedule
whenever its convenient after you sir
anybody home
its uninhabited
what about geographical features anything interesting
theres a chain of volcanoes that spans an entire hemisphere
well i dont know about anyone else but i could use some fresh air put us in a standard orbit
aye sir
find a volcano with a gentle slope preferably one thats not erupting prep a shuttlepod travis well take shifts down to
report
it was a thermokinetic explosion on the outer hull port forward quarter breeches on c deck d deck
bridge to sickbay we need medical assistance
acknowledged
emergency bulkheads
theyre in place but eight subsections have decompressed
was anybody in them
i cant tell sir not yet
find out what happened malcolm
id give you an answer if i could sir the sensor logs arent showing anything all systems were functioning normally
archer to engineering
captain whats going on
i was hoping you could tell me
weve got plasma fires an overload in the eps grid but whatever caused that explosion
i dont have a clue weapons fire an asteroid
nothing on our sensors how are your people
a few bumps and bruises but were all right
keep me posted archer out
any casualty reports
figures are coming in sir seventeen so far including hoshi no fatalities
get this man into the imaging chamber
whats happening are we under attack
i dont know
doctor
captain something just struck the ship starboard side upper aft quadrant
can you get a visual
there just behind the secondary plasma vent you see it
some kind of cloaked ship
its too small
im not reading any biosigns
its armed with tricobalt explosives i think its a mine and judging by the firepower something similar damaged our ship
can you tell if its active
no reason to believe its not
captain its lodged near impulse reactor two an explosion anywhere near there could disable enterprise
what if we polarised the adjacent hull plating
we dont know how its triggered somebody has to go out there and defuse it and it should be me i have the ordnance training
ive never heard of a minefield with just two mines are the quantum beacons still mounted on the grappler arm
i believe so
lower them into position then modify the viewscreen activate the beacon
they were designed to penetrate suliban cloaking devices ill try shifting the phase variance
lieutenant reed to bridge ive opened the outer hatch wish me luck
im detecting something in the gamma spectrum phase variant point zero zero seven five
its surface is pockmarked probably micrometeorite impacts it seems to have been in orbit for some time the spikes are magnetic two of them have locked onto the hull
stand by im going to run an internal scan
there are proximity sensors but they appear to be offline
it looks like the mine doesnt think its hit anything i believe ive found an access panel im going to try and remove it and get a look inside
how bad is it
i cant really tell until we can get into the decompressed sections but i imagine its pretty ugly ive got one piece of good news i did a head count we didnt lose anyone
trip im not sure malcolms going to be able to defuse this thing couldnt we just detach that section of hull plating let it drift away
wed have to reroute some eps conduits theres about three hundred bolt couplings it could be done
how long
three or four hours but i wouldnt recommend it sir wed be exposing a good piece of the impulse manifold
get a team started ill consider it our last resort
im removing the panel
the arming mechanisms extending
captain
we see it malcolm
ever see a ship like that
no its reflecting our scans
why didnt the beacons let us see through its cloak
perhaps the mines use a more primitive cloaking system
sir theyre hailing us
the translators not locking on
archer to sickbay
yes captain
is hoshi in any shape to return to the bridge its urgent
im afraid not she suffered a rather severe concussion
understood
tell him im on my way
youd be of little help in your present condition ensign
any luck
not yet
theyre charging weapons
they missed our starboard nacelle by less than twenty metres
not a very subtle warning shot
can you get us out of here
the orbits of those mines are pretty erratic sir its going to be tricky
well give you whatever help we can bridge to lieutenant reed
go ahead
our friends seem to be anxious for us to leave were going to break orbit nice and slowly
understood if you plan to go to warp sir youll let me know
ill try to remember
maneuvering thrusters only
aye sir
activate the beacon
our friends just vanished
that doesnt mean theyre not still close
lieutenant reed to bridge
go ahead
ive identified four separate detonation circuits if i can isolate them in the proper sequence i should be able to deactivate the mine itll take some doing but to be honest captain its only a theory
how good a theory
the closest thing im familiar with that this device resembles is a tritonclass spatial torpedo ive disarmed at least half a dozen of those i believe i can do it sir
ive got trip working on a backup plan but id prefer not to use it right now youre our best bet be careful malcolm
i see it
bridge
go ahead
another one of those spikes i told you about
what about it
it just magnetised itself to the hull
is there a problem
on its way it went through my leg sir
im on my way lieutenant  the bridge is yours
captain i should be the one to go out there im the engineer
thats why i need you here trip
ensign lie still your injuries dont appear to be serious present circumstances however should not keep up from continuing our denobulan lessons what about anatomy lets begin with the thyroid gland
the thyroid gland
in denobulan
very good how about the hypothalamus
excellent now the xiphoid process thats a difficult one
no no that could be misinterpreted as big toe the proper term would be  all right lets try something simpler pericardia
youll have to wait in line for my osmotic eel to cauterise your wound hes getting quite a workout today
doctor
ensign
they need a translator i should be at my post
i realise youre anxious to help but you wouldnt make it to the turbolift if youd like i could have them bring the comm logs here
thank you doctor
thought you might need a hand
actually id prefer a leg
lets see what we can do with the one you got  could have been worse it missed the bone and it looks like the pressure from the spike is keeping the wound from bleeding too much youll be in sickbay in no time these should cut right through it
actually sir i wouldnt do that my scans show detonation circuits inside the spikes i would consider letting you amputate but if chef got hold of it hed be serving roast reed for sunday dinner just give me something for the pain and ill do my best to reach the access panel
not without doing more damage to that leg
whats more important my leg or your ship
i intend to save both
i dont see how
that backup plan i was telling you about i asked trip to prepare to detach this section of hull plating seemed like a good idea at the time
its still a good idea
not with you attached to it
i hope thats an anaesthetic
phloxs own recipe
please sir may i have some more
i dont want you too sedated im going to need your help someones got to defuse this thing youre going to talk me through it
with all due respect captain disarming mines is extremely delicate business im trained for it youre not
im a quick study
its too dangerous
in case you havent noticed lieutenant were sitting about five metres from an impulse reactor im not leaving until we take this weapon offline
sir
the way i see it you dont have much choice youre sort of stuck here so would you let me get started
i hope youve got a steady hand
theyre ordering us to leave their system immediately or theyll destroy us
charming could you figure out a way to compose a message back explaining were going as fast as we can
i can try
and their next message
they say theyve annexed this planet in the name of something called the romalin star empire
romulan its pronounced romulan
romulans i read about them when i was with daniels
whatd you find out
not much just the name he wouldnt let me see anything else tpol
theyre rumoured to be an aggressive territorial species but the vulcan high command has never made direct contact with them ensign satos translation says that
theyre demanding that we withdraw from this system immediately
thats going to be a little tough to do at the moment is there any way you can explain our situation
she believes shell have a reply prepared within the hour
hows it going out there captain
weve taken two of the detonation circuits offline three more to go keep me posted
the next ones going to be tricky do you see the yshaped components surrounding the circuit
theres six of them
right those are timing relays youll have to rotate each one counterclockwise seventy degrees but it has to be done in the proper order ill guide you through it start with the relay to your upper right raise it one centimetre and then turn it seventy degrees counterclockwise good now pull it out slowly be careful not to touch the housing well done now complete that set on the diagonal
so where were we
sir
this morning at breakfast before we were interrupted you said you didnt follow any particular sport
well im afraid i havent started following one since breakfast sir now go to the relay top centre but watch that one i believe it may be damaged itll need some extra torque to deactivate it
how about hobbies any hobbies
no not really sir
i couldve sworn ive seen you reading a book or two in the mess hall
sir do you really think that this is the appropriate time for a chat
it helps me focus it calms my nerves
well it isnt calming mine
sorry it made you a little nervous this morning too didnt it why is that
if you must know i was honoured to be asked to sit at your table i just wasnt entirely comfortable having a casual meal with my captain i was trained not to fraternise with superior officers
never too late to learn
frankly sir from my point of view that kind of socialising has no place on a starship
i had a co once felt the same way theyre your crew not your friends i thought about that a lot when i took this command but then i realised this is not your typical mission we could be out here for years all we have to depend on is each other
there are two left top left first
i appreciate your suggestions malcolm anything else
well since you asked bridge protocols have become somewhat lax too many people offering opinions were here to carry out your orders sir youre the captain
whats the point of having a senior staff if they just sit around with their mouths shut im glad they have opinions i rely on them keep going
and in the area of security i sometimes think you could show a little more caution sir
im aware of your concerns in that area
not to say that it hasnt been a privilege to have served with you
ah ha
sir
youre talking in the past tense lieutenant
now reinsert all six relays but in the reverse order youre doing fine sir
thanks
youve earned yourself a break travis ensign hutchison can cover the helm for a while
thank you sir but id prefer to stay at my post
bridge to captain archer
go ahead
were clear of the minefield
maintain course and speed
understood
this last detonation circuit has an added attraction im seeing something that looks like a backup arming mechanism well have to fool the circuit into thinking its still online
how do we do that
theres a hyperspanner in the equipment case take out its power cell and strip off the casing
you must have realised this wasnt going to be your typical armory posting that my command style lacked a certain spit and polish
it was obvious if you dont mind me saying so
strange
whats strange sir
i understand you came from a long line of royal navy men your father your grandfather why pick starfleet why not continue the family tradition
god knows i tried
what happened
ill need a circuit probe
so what happened
i was raised on the water i knew how to handle a boat before i could ride a bicycle studied all the great naval battles i dont know i suppose i thought id just grow out of it
grow out of what
aquaphobia
youre afraid of the water
more precisely afraid of drowning
so instead of a life on the sea you chose a life in the vacuum of space
i had a greatuncle who suffered from the same problem but he faced his fears joined the navy had a distinguished career all you have to do is attach it to the cylinder on your upper right its working start with the topmost component use the caliper to lift it a few millimetres and then turn it clockwise three hundred and sixty degrees and then gently reinsert it he was something of a hero to me my greatuncle
the one with aquaphobia
indeed he signed up with the submarine service
talk about facing your deepest fears
he was a brave man wasnt long before hed worked his way up through the ranks made chief engineer on the hms clement do you know the story of the clement sir
i dont think i do
good now the other five components repeat the same process on each one counterclockwise
you were telling me about the clement
they were on a routine patrol when they had an accident now theres a beautiful irony for you they hit a mine left over from some world war there they were trapped underneath an ice shelf several compartments flooding including engineering can you imagine my greatuncle the man afraid of drowning the ship was sinking losing power according to his lieutenant my greatuncle sealed himself in the engine room and kept the reactor online long enough for his crew to make it to the escape pods he went down with his ship he did what he had to do to save his crewmates
i appreciate what youre trying to tell me malcolm but i was hoping youd be able to save your heroics for another time
i just want you to know sir that i am prepared
got you
if were not able to defuse this mine the safety of the crew
i said i heard you lieutenant
im afraid we have another problem sir
what what is it
i need to use the bathroom
i wont tell a soul
in my ev suit sir
sir
were being hailed
youve ignored our warnings
we were unable to translate your language until a short time ago were trying to defuse a weapon lodged on our hull
im well aware of your situation our scans show youre prepared to detach the hull segment surrounding the mine complete the procedure and leave this system immediately
weve got a man trapped out there dont your scans show you that
one crewman you have eighty two others safely aboard jettison the hull segment and leave we will not tolerate espionage
tpol report
theyre demanding that we jettison the section of hull plating and leave
they scanned us captain they know were ready to detach it
im defusing the last detonation circuit stand by
its rearming reset that last component quickly
lieutenant
when you deactivated that final circuit it triggered a sub detonator
how can we get to it
we cant its too deep inside wed have to dismantle the entire mine captain those heroics we spoke about i think it may be time youve done all you can sir for what its worth youd make a fine armoury officer
show me that subdetonator
id prefer a burial at sea if im not completely vaporised
i thought you were afraid of the water your scanner lieutenant
i told you sir theres nothing we can do
well dismantle this thing piece by piece if we have to
thatll take days
my schedules open
and these romulans they dont seem like the patient types the longer we stay in this system the more likely theyre going to attack as much as i appreciate all your efforts you have to detach the hull plating its the only option
im not about to leave one of my crew behind
youre putting enterprise at risk
were wasting time help me figure out a way to get you off of here thats an order
what the hell are you doing
great
if i were the kind of captain you think i should be id bust your ass back to crewman
begging your pardon sir but if you were that kind of captain we wouldnt be having this conversation youd have cut me loose by now
im not going to do that malcolm when we triggered that subdetonator why didnt the mine explode right away
how many seconds went by before i rearmed it
sir
how many seconds
i dont remember ten maybe twelve
it felt more like twenty
ten twenty whats the difference
if it had exploded how big would the yield have been
judging by the damage the first mine caused id guess about a quarter of a kiloton what are you getting at sir
how close is your team to finishing
theyre down to the last few couplings whats going on out there
were going to detach the plating
im sure you did everything you could captain
im going with him can a shuttle pod hatch withstand a quarterkiloton blast
depends how close it was
twenty metres maybe twenty five
theyre reinforced with duratanium alloy they can take a hell of a beating what have you got in mind
i need two shuttlepod hatches have them brought up here on the double
sir
on the double
captain i assume theres no point in my questioning your plan
bridge to captain archer
go ahead
were ready
see you soon
hang on fellas
six hundred metres
another hundred ought to do it
subcommander
hail them
no response
theyre charging weapons
polarise the hull plating
ill do what i can but keep in mind were missing some of it
its rearming
thats it lets go
now malcolm
enterprise to captain archer captain respond
maybe their transmitters were knocked out in the blast travis
i see them bearing two one three mark four closing in
open the doors to launch bay two
the romulans are locking weapons
bridge to doctor phlox
go ahead
meet us outside launch bay two
theyre targeting our engines
a hundred metres more fifty ive got them sealing launch bay doors
go to warp ensign
are you all right
all things considered if i may say so sir your style of command does have its advantages
so how long was it
i counted ten seconds
ten it was more like twenty
respectfully sir it was ten
im not going to argue with you malcolm it was twenty thats an order
its incredible were still in one piece
if that mine had hit another metre to the left we cant polarise the port bow plating until those breaches are sealed
whats your guess
assuming we can find some tritanium alloy three or four months and with this kind of damage the best i can give you is warp two maybe two point one
in other words were a decade away from jupiter station what about the transceiver array
the subspace antennas damaged all weve got is shortrange
weve answered enough calls for help over the past year its time someone returned the favour
you serious
archer to ensign sato
go ahead sir
i want you to get started on a general distress call assistance required minor repairs dont go into too much detail
understood sir
archer out
youre killing me
push lieutenant two more seconds and rest
it cant be ethical to cause a patient this much pain
its unethical to harm a patient i can inflict as much pain as i like a positive attitude is vital to the healing process the more you complain the longer your recovery is likely to take
when will i be able to return to duty
another week possibly two
two weeks
attitude lieutenant the wound might heal faster if youd allow me to apply a few more regulan blood worms
youre not putting any more of those things inside my leg you still havent found the last one
hell come out on his own eventually
did you hear that i dont believe it trip told me he fixed that squeak  go ahead
captain were receiving response to the distress call
its a tellarite freighter
put them through this is captain archer of the starship enterprise thank you for responding
how may we be of assistance
we need help in repairing some hull damage if you can rendezvous with us wed be happy to discuss
schedule wont permit it the signal is
im sorry sir theyre barely within range
can you repeat
transmitting coordinates repair station at
sounded like he said repair station
we have received a set of coordinates
what do you know about these tellarites
theyre not the most agreeable species but theyre usually trustworthy the coordinates are three and a half days away at warp two
i think its worth a look
aye sir
this is captain archer of the starship enterprise we need to make some repairs i was told you might be willing to help us wed be grateful for any assistance you could offer please respond
nothing
biosigns
none that i can detect
maybe its abandoned
we might be able to board it salvage some of the materials we need
it doesnt seem that enterprise could fit inside those docking berths whats it look like inside
im detecting a liquid helium atmosphere the temperatures two hundred and seventy degrees below zero  a biomolecular probe
sir
its reconfiguring to fit the saucer section
the liquid heliums being replaced by a warmer oxygennitrogen atmosphere
still no response to our hails
it appears an invitations been extended
they need to work a little on their hospitality
i dont see that we have a lot of options
take us in
theyve isolated every hull breach every damaged system ill be damned we scratched the hull right here a year ago i bumped it with the inspection pod remember
i thought i told you to have that repainted
i was getting around to it
everythings in english the ship wasnt the only thing they probed i think thats malcolm thats where his left leg was injured
this facility may have the technology to repair mister reed as well
the analysis of your vessel is complete select a method of compensation to begin the repair process
who am i speaking with
your inquiry was not recognised
is there someone here i can speak with
your inquiry was not recognised
i dont think theres anyone back there
perhaps the stations automated
are you saying you can repair all our systems
select a method of compensation to begin the repair process
we can give them either three warp coils five deuterium injectors or two hundred litres of warp plasma
i wouldnt recommend giving up any hardware we cant replace
plasma
i think we can spare it
if we agree to these terms how long will the repairs take
time to completion thirty four point two earth hours
im telling you the boys at jupiter station would take three months
its a fair exchange
select a method of compensation to begin the repair process
compensation will be due when the repairs are completed your vessel will then disengage immediately all personnel are required to vacate areas that are undergoing reconstruction
look at this
its our repair schedule
transmit it to hoshi and have her inform the crew
enterprise to captain archer
go ahead
some kind of mechanical arms are being attached to the outer hull
its all right travis stand by
the recreation facility is now available to all personnel enjoy your visit
if this their idea of a recreation facility you might want to ask for our plasma back
a matter energy converter
it could be a transporter an awfully small one
i believe its a molecular synthesiser of some kind similar to a protein resequencer but far more advanced water cold
i saw a similar device on a tarkalean vessel it was capable of replicating almost any inanimate object
if we had one of these in engineering we could make all the spare parts we need i wonder what else is on the menu one panfried catfish
smells like the real thing
well
not bad
i doubt theres a catfish within a hundred and thirty light years
its genome is stored in enterprises computer as is the recipe the station evidently scanned our database
it would have been nice to have been asked i can only imagine what else this thing knows about us
captain youve got to try this
thanks but ill stick with whatever chefs serving ill be on the bridge
are you sure this thing knows what its doing
thats the third time youve asked
you didnt answer me the first two times
its remarkable your cells are regenerating at an exponential rate do you see how its using a cytokinetic enzyme to stimulate the cell division
lovely
i could certainly use a device like this perhaps the captain could negotiate a trade of some sort
the tissue is completely healed even the scar is gone try standing up any pain
none
come in
repairs are currently underway on c deck work on launch bay one is scheduled to begin at twenty two hundred hours
they even fixed the squeak in the floor i was starting to wonder if we had a gremlin under the deck plating
a mythical creature british pilots used to blame them for problems they couldnt explain
perhaps i should scan for one
that wont be necessary is trip happy with how the repairs are going
he says theyre exceeding starfleet specifications
thats good to hear anything else
if i may make an observation
go ahead
you seemed troubled
guess i need to do a better job at repressing my emotions these repairs are one hell of a bargain at only two hundred litres of warp plasma dont you think
not every culture is based on the acquisition of wealth the stations builders could simply have been interested in helping others
what happened to them they could have at least left a message thanks for stopping by
perhaps they prefer anonymity
dont you find that a little suspicious i know you dont put a lot of faith in your feelings but ive learned to trust mine something doesnt smell right
honestly i started to feel a little sorry for the doctor there wasnt anything for him to do but stand there and watch this thing work
i know how he must have felt i saw an entire transtator assembly replaced in fifteen minutes it would have taken my crew a week with this kind of technology starfleet could build ships that maintain themselves they wouldnt need chief engineers or tactical officers
a starship without a tactical officer i cant say i see the point
youd think a computer that can do all this would have to be pretty big our computers the most advanced in the fleet and its three decks high
i suppose youre right
so where is it
i dont follow
i ran a scan of the station a few hours ago these are the docking berths were here this is the diagnostic room
well that compartments the only place it could be but its barely half the size of this one
a machine capable of billions of calculations every nanosecond and it can fit inside the proverbial bread box id love to get a look at that
you could always ask
i tried your inquiry was not recognised
well i guess thats that
not necessarily this cooling duct runs all the way to the center of the station i saw an access port in one of the corridors
this computer might not take kindly to people snooping around
i havent seen any no trespassing signs were explorers wheres your spirit of adventure
i left it in a romulan minefield
almost got it
if the captain learns about this well both be scrubbing plasma conduits for a month
mayweather
travis its the captain would you mind coming down to launch bay one
i thought that section was offlimits sir
not anymore i could use a hand ensign
aye sir
are you sure this is the right direction
evening subcommander
captain hello hello
do you know how stupid that little stunt was you could just as easily been transported out into space youre senior officers youre supposed to be setting an example for the rest of the crew
it was my idea sir
i think lieutenant reed is old enough to make his own decisions  youve made it clear to me that you think discipline aboard enterprise has gotten a little too lax im beginning to agree with you youre both restricted to quarters until further notice dismissed
yes sir
aye sir
hold on did you notice anything interesting when you were in there
depends on what you mean by interesting
tpol to captain archer
go ahead
youre needed in launch bay one immediately
what happened
hes dead captain
the subcutaneous burns are consistent with an isolytic shock but i cant be certain until i perform a full postmortem ill keep you apprised
it looks like he was trying to tap into the eps grid when this relay overloaded
why the hell would he come down here during his off hours and start tampering with the power systems
i dont get it travis would have checked with me before doing any maintenance
did you notify the crew that this section was offlimits
yes
well apparently somebody didnt get the message what time did he go off duty
eighteen hundred hours
malcolm and i saw him on the station about a half an hour later he was having dinner with hoshi
talk to her see if he said anything to her about this and go over the comm logs i want to know if he talked to anyone else
it might be a good idea to check his quarters as well
post a security detail outside every section thats under repair
aye sir
a member of my crew is dead we dont know what happened
your inquiry was not recognised
my helmsman was killed in launch bay one we think it happened while that section was offlimits
all personnel are required to vacate areas that are undergoing reconstruction
were aware of that you must have some kind of record of what happened
all personnel are required to vacate areas that are undergoing reconstruction
i need to talk to a person someone who can access your database and tell me what happened
your inquiry was not recognised
who built this station what species
your inquiry was not recognised
what species
any damage to these facilities will be charged to your vessel
computer begin recording subjects name ensign travis mayweather human male weight seventy two kilograms age twenty six earth years far too young to be on this table cellular decay suggests that death occurred at approximately twenty three thirty hours preliminary cause of death ventricular fibrillation induced by an isolytic shock the vascular system appears to have functioned as a conduit for the discharge the musculature shows extensive necrosis along the conductive pathway there are subcutaneous burns over approximately twelve percent of the body  the right phalanges and metacarpus exhibit signs of multiple thermal fractures computer pause ensign this is not an ideal time
i wanted to say goodbye
you may find this disturbing
ive seen a body before fifteen of them on that alien ship
its different when its someone you know personally
i was hoping it was another one of his practical jokes travis called me down to decon a few weeks ago he said that he brought some kind of gelatinous lifeform aboard he said it might be sentient that the captain needed me to figure out how to communicate with it
i dont recall that
there was no lifeform it was only strawberry gelatine i told him i was going to get him back im sorry
it might comfort you to know he felt very little pain an isolytic shock instantly impairs the nervous thats odd
what
theyre dead all of them excuse me ensign
anything
no it doesnt look like travis used the comm system last night crewman hayes says she passed him on his way to the launch bay but they didnt speak she said he seemed to be in quite a hurry
whats this
its a letter to his sister it was on the monitor when i came in im afraid there isnt much here he mentions something about cancelling breakfast with him
that was last week i had to postpone it have we been able to locate his parents
subcommander tpols working on it but it could take some time cargo ships arent always easy to track down
archer
its doctor phlox captain i need to see you right away
did you find something
as a matter of fact i did this is not ensign mayweather
what
its a nearly perfect replica ive never seen a lifeform duplicated in such extraordinary detail from its epidermis down to its cellular proteins this is remarkable work
if its so perfect how do you know its not him
you recall what happened to crewman fisher last month after our visit to tessik prime
he came down with rigelian fever
i inoculated the entire crew to prevent an outbreak would you mind rolling up your sleeve
the vaccine contained millions of genetically altered microbes most of them are still in your bloodstream they typically survive for oh at least several weeks
every one of the alien microbes in this body is dead
couldnt they have been killed by the isolytic shock
these microbes thrive on isolytic energy if anything they would have multiplied i believe that someone or something has abducted ensign mayweather and left this facsimile in his place
apparently bulkheads arent the only thing this station can replicate
its ironic in a way the station can duplicate a dead human body in all its exquisite detail yet a living simple onecelled organism is beyond its capability
ive located ensign mayweathers parents
youd better hold off their son may still be alive you and trip managed to get pretty far inside the station how close do you think you got to the computer core
we were within twenty metres when we tripped the sensors
think you could find a way to get past them
i believe so
our repairs will be complete in nineteen minutes the stations expecting us to depart
bridge to engineering
tucker here
trip
have you prepared our payment
the canisters are almost ready sir
dont be in such a hurry
two hundred litres of warp plasma as promised
please place your compensation on the transport platform
hold on hold on theres a couple of problems we need to discuss first now im not real happy with the quality of some of your work are you listening to me
please place your compensation on the transport platform
ive looked at the bolt couplings you used to attach the new hull plating im afraid theyre not up to starfleet specs and the subspace amplifier you repaired were picking up distortion on all the highband frequencies
please place your compensation on the transport platform
were not paying until we sort this out
what guarantee do i have that these duranium pins wont fly out the instant we jump to warp
your inquiry was not recognised
on my world we have an expression the customers always right maybe you should make that part of your programme i want to know how someone files a grievance around here
its there about five metres ahead
sounds like youve got more important things to deal with
incursion detected in primary data core vacate this section or your vessel will be compromised
im detecting one human biosign
are they alive
their vital organs appear to be functioning theyve suffered severe neurological damage
incursion detected in primary data core vacate this section or your vessel will be compromised
their synaptic pathways have been reconfigured integrated into the computer core
incursion detected in primary data core vacate this section or your vessel will be compromised
captain
incursion detected in primary data core vacate this section or your vessel will be compromised
three of the stations arms have just clamped on to the hull
polarise the hull plating
theres no effect
stand by weapons
theyre going offline
the stations tapped in to the ships umbilical ports its overriding our command functions
try to lock out the main computer
i cant our access codes have been scrambled
sir
its okay travis were taking you home
right here
archer to the bridge
the comms down
travis
on his way to sickbay whats our status
its been better the stations got us by the thrusters
impulse engines
offline
were losing main power
life supports failing
malcolm i think its time we deliver our payment
it did some heavy damage sir power levels are dropping but the plasma hasnt ignited the o2 conduits yet
it needs to reach three thousand degrees malcolm be patient
yes sir
im reading secondary explosions throughout the station
command functions are coming back online
engines
impulse and thrusters
one of those arms is still locked onto the hull
if we dont disengage soon well be incinerated
full thrusters
its no good and if i fired up the impulse engines wed probably tear off half the saucer section
can you launch a torpedo
at this range sir i wouldnt recommend it
i agree but i dont think we have much choice
one more lieutenant
get us out of here
you look pretty good for a dead guy howre you feeling
much better sir thank you the doctor told me what happened im not sure i understand
were still trying to figure that out for ourselves
i may be able to shed some light on the subject
it seems to be some kind of interface designed to convert neural impulses into binary code essentially the station was using your brain to enhance its processing power
why would it do that
the cerebral cortex is the most sophisticated computer known to exist
what about all those other people
according to tpols scans most of them had been there for years the damage to their brains was irreversible fortunately you were removed before any permanent injury occurred
when can i have my helmsman back
id like to observe him for another twenty four hours if you dont mind
captains mess friday morning oh eight hundred dont be late
sounds good sir
starfleet didnt send us out here to humiliate ourselves how long were we in orbit grovelling six days
five sir and it wasnt exactly grovelling
apologising asking forgiveness just because we ate lunch in front of them on our own ship months ago i call that grovelling
they were offended
the kreetassans manufacture plasma injectors we need one
so we spend six days grovelling
five days
and when they finally agree to talk to us we go down and what do they do they keep us waiting for twelve hours and then send us packing no explanation no plasma injector just leave go back to your ship
we obviously offended them again
maybe my hairs parted on the wrong side im exhausted and ive had it with these people
go ahead
the three of you are clear to go but im afraid ill need to keep porthos for a while
whats the problem
he picked up a pathogen of some kind on the surface neither decon agent has been effective
what are you going to do
im not sure yet ill let you know as soon as i run some tests
feel better porthos
docll have you good as new before you know it i might even break the nocheese rule tonight
sorry fella you got to stay
were playing with fire captain its just a matter of time before this injector gives up the ghost
youve got four more the ship can run on four
yeah but it cant run on three you know what happens at warp speed when youve only got three plasma injectors online
what are the odds of us losing another one before we find a replacement
im not comfortable with four captain we need five what the hell happened down there anyway
tpol thinks we insulted them again
how you didnt eat cabbage before you left
i was a perfect gentleman were going to have to go somewhere else to find you your injector trip these people are impossible
their components are metallurgically sound dependable we could look for six months and not find anything half as compatible youre a trained diplomat take the high road theres got to be some way you can kiss and make up
ill have tpol see if she can find out what we did but im not promising anything
i went to decon i thought you were there with porthos is every
its all right to pet him youll have to use the isolation gloves
did you run your tests
his autoimmune system is collapsing ive isolated the pathogen broken down its protein sequence i cant explain it captain it shouldnt be affecting him like this but it is
so what are you doing
running more tests im sure ill come up with something
how sure could this be lifethreatening
its too early to tell
didnt we send his genome to the kreetassans along with ours
i transmitted them myself before you left enterprise
so shouldnt they have noticed theres a pathogen in their atmosphere that his immune system cant handle
they should have assuming they took the time to check
im told ive offended these people twice once for eating in front of them the second time i dont even know what for but if their carelessness has hurt porthos or god forbid ends up killing him theyre going to find out what being offended is all about
porthos has no intention of giving up and neither do i
you hear that boy
were all pulling for you
did you reach them
yes
and
i think we should discuss this in your ready room
well
do you recall the stand of trees outside the hall of diplomacy
what are you talking about
theyre alvera trees over three hundred years old
thats fascinating did you apologise for whatever we did wrong are we going to get our plasma injector
the kreetassans consider the alvera trees cultural treasures apparently porthos urinated on one of them
and thats what theyre insulted about
it is understandable
well maybe if theyd bothered to read the genetic profile we sent theyd have told us to leave the dog on the ship and then he wouldnt have had an opportunity to pee on one of their precious trees
i conveyed your sincerest apologies to the chancellery theyre discussing possible acts of contrition
where the hell do you get off conveying my sincerest apologies theyre the ones who should be sorry
i dont need to remind you that commander tucker is relying on us
there are some things more important than plasma injectors
are you referring to your pride
ill tell you one thing subcommander if anything happens to porthos ill be the one watering their alvera trees
if you were a married man id be wondering if your wife had thrown you out
i just thought it might cheer porthos up if i slept here tonight that is if its all right with you
i dont think your dog is in any condition to know whether youre here or not
well then maybe itll cheer me up
be my guest take your pick
hows porthos doing
my submammalian database contains no pertinent files on bugles but theres sufficient information on similar chordata
beagles
yes
let me ask you a question doc just out of curiosity are there any dogs on your homeworld
the denobulan lemur is highly soughtafter its not exactly a dog but you could say its doglike it has a tail fur most have one head
did your medical training include any
captain please you neednt be concerned i hold six degrees in interspecies veterinary medicine
i thought you were just you know a people doctor
as a matter of fact ive also earned degrees in dentistry hematology botanical pharmacology
im impressed so hows he doing
i believe ive eliminated the pathogen the question is whether the treatment ive devised will stabilise his autoimmune system before
before what
in a few hours ill have a more detailed prognosis
before what doctor
there are many harmless strains of bacteria that can become lethal when the immune system is compromised but it is too early to be thinking about that now we should both try to get a few hours of rest if there are any changes in his vital signs the alarms are quite loud good night
i would have brought you some cheese but doctor phlox wouldnt have let me give you any
doctor are you all right
im sorry captain did i wake you just trimming my toenails they grow quite rapidly have to keep them groomed at least once a week
just wanted to be sure youre okay
thanks for your concern good night
im sorry captain did i wake you again
what the hells going on
feeding time
dont be greedy
how long was i asleep
nearly an hour
does this go on every night
only when im here theyre very demanding when they know im in sickbay
great porthos
ill still need at least a couple of hours
is he comfortable
hes fast asleep
im glad to see someone is ill check back in a couple of hours
hows your dog
nice of you to ask well know in a couple of hours
have you heard from your friends on the surface
not yet
i guess they havent finished compiling their list of punishments
theyre not interested in punishing you they only want an appropriate apology
im sorry
for what
just practicing
you shouldnt have brought your dog on a diplomatic mission especially considering we had previously offended the kreetassans
they knew we were bringing him we even sent his genetic specs
they could have asked us to leave him behind they didnt porthos has the right to a little fresh air
youre once again ignoring the consequences of your actions
whats that supposed to mean
you obviously place more importance on the quality of the air your pet breathes than on the quality of the plasma that drives your ship
what the hell does one have to do with the other isnt it logical i could care about my ship and my dog
im not questioning your pluralities im questioning your priorities
i really thought you were beginning to understand something about human feelings
not when it pertains to primitive quadrupeds who havent developed the ability to speak or to use a toilet
whats the matter
i obviously cant keep up with you  tpol
weve just received a transmission from the kreetassans
its their reconciliation demands the captains not going to believe this
youd be surprised hoshi
captain i didnt
its all right ensign
were on our way
well this isnt so bad i was sure thered be something in here about standing on one foot with my eyes shut reciting the night before christmas im going back to sickbay to see if i can get an hours sleep before the doctors results come through let me know if this fits with your definition of an appropriate apology
do we have a chainsaw on board
whats happening
hes gone into anaphylactic shock his bodys rejecting the treatment i selected
you said wed know in a few hours if this would work
exactly its not working
is he going to die
fill this with five ccs of tetrasol its the blue fluid second on the right five ccs
five ccs
i dont think so
what
you asked me if he was going to die
are you trying a different treatment let me guess well know in
a couple of hours yes how are things progressing with the kreetassans
theyve got a perfectly good plasma injector sitting on a shelf somewhere but will they share it with us not until i make a fool of myself by going through some series of ritual apologies the fact that porthos is on deaths doorstep doesnt seem to bother any of them theyre the ones who should be apologising not me tpol thinks i care more about my dog than my ship isnt that delightful
why does tpols opinion concern you
shes my science officer my secondincommand she should know more than anyone aboard how dedicated i am to this mission to every member of my crew
you didnt answer my question
porthos has one paw in beagle heaven because these jerks didnt bother to look at his genetic profile am i supposed to ignore that
i would think youd be more interested in commander tuckers opinion youve known him for many years if im not mistaken
it would be nice to have all five plasma injectors working but its not essential we can do fine with four and the fifth one just started to act up we might get another ten light years out of it
have you considered that your anger may encompass more than just porthos and the kreetassans
what
how long has it been since you were intimate with a woman
what
how long has it been
i heard you i suppose youre going to tell me you have a degree in psychiatry too
absolutely
no way not a chance porthos is the only patient youre treating right now you got that let me know if theres any change
archer to commander tucker captain archer
to commander tucker
something wrong captain
sorry to wake you trip but i need to see you in sickbay
give me a minute
captain wants to see me
hes in there
sir
come on in
what happened sir you look terrible
im fine its porthos whos not doing so well
im sorry to hear it sir is there something i could do
how long has it been since youve been intimate with a woman
excuse me
forget it im sorry i woke you up trip i just need some more information on that faulty injector if we take it offline try to repair it what kind of stress will that put on the other four
its a matter of time the longer we have to rely on four injectors the greater the stress problem is i have no idea how long it would take to repair the one thats malfunctioning
and if the stress gets too high
probably be down to three
and
well with three injectors wed be lucky to reach warp speed
go get some sleep
i had a grade school teacher who was certain i stole a pencil off her desk i think it was a pencil she wasnt going to let me go on the field trip to pensacola unless i apologised my mother told me i should tell her i was sorry but i said i didnt steal the damn pencil you know what she told me its okay to apologise when you shouldnt have to just as long as you dont mean it
why havent you adjusted your time to our capital city
i apologise we werent aware that it was required
it isnt a requirement it is simply a courtesy something your species doesnt seem to understand
ill explain it to the captain immediately
you might also explain to your captain that its been nearly three hours since he received our transmission if he has the slightest hope of acquiring any technology from us hed be wise to pay us the courtesy of responding
i understand ill
ill let him know
keep your head down no matter what i do to secure her cage she always finds a way to get out
i thought you said your bat was supposed to be terrified of that thing
it should have been pyrithian moon hawks eat these bats i know i got the silhouette right and i mastered the call years ago
that stuff isnt poisonous is it
no ill be fine
what now
we need to find her before we can catch her shell stay up high have you thought any more about why tpols opinion is so important to you
its two thirty in the morning and im hunting an escaped bat thats all im thinking about right now doctor that and porthos
sexual tension captain theres no doubt in my mind
by the air duct do you see it
thats just the filter bracket for the past few months ive noticed increasing friction between you and the subcommander you must understand that im trained to observe these things
with all do respect to your training youre wrong tpol and i have been getting along just fine so let it alone
when one person believes their sexual attraction toward another is inappropriate they often exhibit unexpected behaviour such as inordinate anger toward comparisons made between their ship and their beagle
listen doc theres no sexual attraction
shes coming back down watch out
dont let her in the corridor
hey are you all right what are they trying to do to you
the kreetassans called sir
what for
theyre anxious to get your response to their last transmission
its the middle of the night
they also suggested that we should synchronise our time to their capital city
did they
its not a requirement sir just a courtesy
thank you ensign
hows porthos
ill let you know in a couple of hours
everything okay
nothing new ill stay with him
thanks
unless youd like to continue our discussion regarding subcommander tpol
we are gathered here today to bid a final farewell to a faithful and kind colleague a friend who would never hesitate to offer his paw in exchange for a simple smile or a slice of cheese like his namesake this quadruped believed we should stand together all for one and one for all
when one person believes their sexual attraction toward another is inappropriate they often exhibit unexpected behaviour
go ahead
hoshi you and the dog are clear to go but im afraid ill need to keep the other two for a while
whats the problem
you both picked up a pathogen on the surface well have to try another decon agent
feel better
tell me captain have you thought any more about why tpols opinion is so important to you how long has it been since you were intimate with a woman
i dreamt porthos died
lets hope your dream wasnt prophetic
any indication on how your second treatments doing
it doesnt appear to be doing very well
an old girlfriends mother had this beagle i was crazy about even after her daughter and i broke up we stayed in touch when the dog got pregnant i was the first one she called four males in the litter the four musketeers ive had porthos since he was six weeks old i grew up with dogs cant remember not having one you have any pets when you were a kid
my people dont keep pets
i thought you said something about the denobulan lemur being highly sought after
oh very much so their kidneys are considered a great delicacy
i thought you might be hungry
how very kind
was there something on their list about apologising on a full stomach
you read the kreetassans document
sorry sorry im a little on edge i havent slept very much but im doing the breast i the best i can
i understand ensign sato and i have broken down the reconciliation demands into specific categories if youre interested in reviewing them
my only concern right now is porthos
im sorry to have interrupted
no no it its okay when you get back to the bridge why dont you send me your lips lisp list
two pillarian slips within thirty seconds interesting
what are you doing
my treatment was effective at least partially his immune system is stabilising but his pituitary gland was severely damaged its all but disintegrated bring me the small grey cage on the second shelf the one with the blue top
whats in here
a calrissian chameleon fill this for me
ill need to alter its dna to avoid rejection but its pituitary gland should be compatible with your dogs
youre going to perform a transplant from a lizard
unless you have a better suggestion its a shame actually the chameleon secretes a rare toxin thats very useful in treating respiratory infections shes the last one i have
whats the tank for
ill need to superhydrate the canine in order to minimize the shock to his pulmonary system
youre going to drown my dog
only for an hour captain there should be no problem resuscitating him once the surgerys complete
how many times have you done this before
never
has anyone done this before
not to my knowledge
you know this isnt some guinea pig youre working on here this is porthos my beagle my pal from what youre telling me the closest thing your people have to pets are furry little things that go well with onions
perhaps youre right captain perhaps im insensitive to the bond between you and your subservient quadruped ill leave the procedure up to you but whatever your decision make it quickly
just for the sake of argument lets say that some of my anger toward tpol had a component of sexual tension to it im not saying it does but just for the sake of argument
yes
what do you mean yes youre the psychiatrist what am i supposed to do about it am i supposed i to ignore it am i supposed to say something to her
neither
neither
if you were ignoring it you obviously wouldnt be seeking my opinion especially under these circumstances as for discussing it with the subcommander thats entirely up to you but i cant imagine an outcome that would do anything but make matters worse pass me the autosuture please the yellow one
when will we know if the transplants working
one step at a time first we need to resuscitate him
so i cant ignore it and i cant talk about it what do you suggest i do
be aware of it captain simply be aware of it youd be surprised what a difference thatll make lower the fluidic temperature twelve degrees
if porthos pulls through will he need a special diet or treatments having a chameleons pituitary gland
you may have trouble finding him hell have the ability to blend into his background when frightened
youre kidding
yes i am
does your expertise on sexual tension come from professional training or firsthand experience
i do have three wives
and they each have
two husbands besides myself
sounds very complicated
very why else be polygamous
so these three wives
each have three husbands a total of seven hundred and twenty relationships forty two of which have romantic possibilities
you told me you had five children how many are there in this whole extended family
thirty one at last count
you must miss them youve been away for over two years
im ready for the synaptic inductor the small blue one my children all left the nest years ago captain
i would have never guessed you dont look that old
ill take that as a compliment my two daughters im proud to say followed in my footsteps ones a surgeon the others a biochemist
how about the other three
my eldest sons an artist a potter actually he lives in the same town as his mother creates beautiful things
and the other two
my two younger sons and i never saw eyetoeye im afraid we havent spoken in quite some time
im sorry i shouldnt have
perfectly all right you asked me if i missed them the answer is yes every one of them the children the wives even the other husbands but we denobulans live a long time captain and right now there is nowhere id rather be than serving with the interspecies medical exchange aboard this wonderful vessel of yours
listen doc however this turns out i want to apologise for accusing you of being insensitive before
as i recall you accused my entire species of being insensitive then i apologise to you and all your fellow denobulans
well i cant speak for the others but on behalf of myself i accept and to think tpol told me you were incapable of apologising
i didnt think your shift began until oh nine hundred
i took the liberty of temporarily synchronising our clocks to the kreetassans capital city
just a courtesy  ensign will you join me
have a seat youve read the list
yes sir subcommander tpol and i broke it down and
she told me the last part just before the end that little expression that gets repeated do you know what im talking about
its a couplet from one of their oldest political documents
their pronunciation guide doesnt make any sense im going to need some help
come in subcommander
mister tucker reports that the new plasma injector is operating well within starfleet parameters
did he tell you they gave us two spares out of the kindness of their hearts
evidently the finesse you exhibited outside the hall of diplomacy was appreciated
since ive been getting so much practice giving apologies i thought i might give you one
thats not necessary
yeah it is ive been under a lot of stress lately havent gotten much sleep my dog
theres no need to apologise
whatever friction theres been between us id like to try to minimise it
friction is to be expected whenever people work in close quarters for extended periods of time
i guess thats always been true especially when the people are of the opposite sex
then its good that youre my superior officer that were not in a position to allow ourselves to become attracted to one another hypothetically if we were the friction that you speak of could be much more problematic
no apologies captain
i promise
i hear things went very well on the surface
i doubt i would have even gone down there if it hadnt been for you doc i owe you one
youll be pleased to know that while you were gone things went very well up here too
the transplant
not the slightest sign of rejection
can i see him
by all means
hey
its been one hell of a night hasnt it how soon can he leave
nows as good a time as any
but hes
unconscious nonsense hes just asleep
porthos
come on boy yeah were going home sickbays all yours
youre welcome back anytime captain
what are you doing in my chair
i didnt touch anything i just like to look inside the ships that come here
you should have asked
you might have said no
well what do you think
well its a little small and your thruster controls are hard to reach
maybe you need longer arms
how fast can it go
shes designed for one quarter impulse but ive been able to squeeze a little more out of her
youre a pilot
engineer commander trip tucker
qell
nice to meet you
could you teach me how to fly it i can drive the crawler that we use to move our drill rigs
tell you what ill be heading back up to the ship later you can come along if its all right with your folks ill give you a tour
really
two power cells we need six
we cant spare that many maybe three
do you have any idea how much labour it takes to refine a litre of deuterium
actually no id enjoy seeing how your facility works
we have three months of good weather captain three months to pump all the deuterium we can before the winter we dont have time to give tours five power cells for two hundred litres i cant do any better
our medical stores are running low
four power cells and whatever medical supplies we can spare
all right but only if you can repair our pumps
commander tucker and his team will do the best they can
i expect you to leave orbit in two days if the pumps are working youll leave with the deuterium if not youll leave without it are we agreed
agreed
its yours if youd like it
i wouldnt know what to feed it
her needs are modest a nutrient broth every three or four days less often when shes working
working
shell ingest a little blood while shes healing an injured artery
thank you but ill just take some vascular adhesive
try this instead
an autosuture
im surprised you dont have one
this is a very expensive piece of equipment i cant
nonsense please cardiostimulator neural shock kit i had no idea processing deuterium was such a dangerous business
it can be
ive only heard of hexatriol being used to treat serious plasma burns
deuterium can burn almost as hot as plasma when its ignited
i hope you wont need it is there something wrong
no id better get back
of course
thank you again
youve been to other colonies that trade deuterium havent you
several
are they all this rustic
not usually
their equipments falling apart half these structures look like theyre about to collapse phlox tells me they dont even have basic medical supplies deuterium is a highly valuable commodity youd think these people would be better off
were here to trade with them not judge their living conditions
then why do they need us to finish fixing their pumps in two days whats the hurry
lieutenant a ship just dropped out of warp six hundred thousand kilometres and closing
i see her
its probably more deuterium customers
im reading twelve biosigns all klingon
youll want to keep an eye on those phase inverters they tend to depolarise
pump six
koroks ship is entering orbit
i thought we had three more days
secure the pumps get everyone inside
some kind of trouble
help me close these induction valves
whats going on whos korok
they must realise that you trade with other ships
they believe that we have an exclusive arrangement
if they think anyones been here before them they get very angry
please dont get involved well talk to them
archer to enterprise
go ahead captain
have the klingons detected enterprise yet
no indication sir
travis adjust your orbit
keep enterprise out of sight
aye sir
my old friend
we werent expecting you so soon weve had trouble with two of our pumps
my crews hungry lets have food and drink then well discuss business
your deuterium we dont have all of it we did our best but we need more time
can you make out what theyre saying
tessic is explaining that their yield isnt what theyd hoped
good ears
without those pumps we couldnt operate at full capacity
i sense what youre about to say is not going to make me happy
we can give you eighty thousand litres if youll give us one more week well have the rest
youve had enough time well take all of it now
we dont have it i told you two pumps were down
they all appear to be working
we were just able to repair them
youre lying
leave him alone youll get your deuterium
wait please
i can get deuterium anywhere i come here because i like you when you show me hospitality and respect
you take everything we own and you want us to respect you
ill give you four days have it all ready  hijol
lets get him inside
so this is your exclusive arrangement
its not your concern
how long have these bullies been pushing you around
five seasons they take all the first yield deuterium we can extract
hold still
after they leave we manage to pull a few thousand litres out of the deep strata but it takes weeks and its so full of impurities we can barely refine it
it still brings in a decent price we make enough to get through the winter
barely
have you tried contacting your homeworld
its too far away
you must have weapons some way to defend yourselves how many of them are there
usually seven
seven youve got them outnumbered nine or ten to one
youve never seen a klingon in battle have you we tried to stand up to them once three seasons ago five of us died fighting them then they killed three more to prove their point
one of them was his father
maybe theres something we can do
just take your two hundred litres and go if youre here when they come back theyll kill you
mister reed
the klingon ships gone to warp sir im sending a shuttlepod down
well be at the landing site
ill catch up with you later captain sorry i never got to give you that tour
i once saw a kellenite ship with cannons and torpedoes
most big ships carry weapons
like enterprise
yeah like enterprise
you could have fought the klingons beaten them
maybe
why didnt you try
its not that simple
come in
the deuteriums been stowed two hundred litres should i instruct ensign mayweather to break orbit
so thats it we just take our deuterium and leave they work their asses off to provide for their families and then the klingons just stroll in and rob them blind does that seem right to you malcolm tells me that klingon ship isnt much more than a freighter id lay odds theyre no match for enterprise
and if they withdraw what will keep them from coming back after weve gone
we could try to contact the klingon high council we saved klaang from the suliban we pulled one of their battle cruisers out of a gas giant i say they owe us a favour
i doubt these marauders answer to the high council
i already know where vulcans stand on interfering with other cultures but this isnt a culture seventy six settlers are being preyed upon if this were an earth colony id be grateful if someone showed up to give me a hand
captain this may surprise you but i agree however short of killing the klingons any action we take will only make the situation worse
i just hate the idea of turning our backs
need a hand
control arm is jammed i could use some help with the release valve
okay
turn it to the left
this one
thought youd be off charting your next start system by now
sometimes i have a bad habit of overstaying my welcome
you obviously didnt come down here in the middle of the night to help me with this crawler
seems to me this crawlers the least of your problems
weve been through this before its not your concern give it another turn
you said theyve been coming here for what five seasons how much longer do you plan on letting this go on another five
thats good leave it there reconnect this coolant line intakes above your head
i had a talk with my tactical officer were confident you have the ability to defend yourselves
we already tried there are eight people buried not far from here who can attest to that
it would be different this time we would help you prepare
i dont want your help im responsible for my people not you they put their trust in me they depend on me im supposed to protect them look at me i can barely keep this crawler running you say you and your tactical officer want to help us even if you do once youre gone well be alone again waiting for them to come back
theres a saying on my world give a man a fish and he eats for a day teach him to fish and he eats for a lifetime
i was hoping for a bit more to work with
they do a decent job keeping the shiba lizards from chewing on the power couplings
with a few modifications these should be effective against more than lizards
you must have a well stocked armoury onboard enterprise
but this battle wont be won with firepower deception and surprise can be just as potent as brute force
klingons are aggressive warriors but their tactics are crude theyre slow to adapt to changing circumstances
this all sounds very ambitious what exactly are you expecting us to do
youre going to lure them into a trap
what kind of trap
a very hot one the deuterium in those wellheads how much pressure is it under three four thousand millibars
five
should create some interesting fireworks
youll never get the klingons near that deuterium field they know it isnt safe
they may be crude but theyre not fools
thats where deception and surprise come in did you bring the map i asked you for
its right here
the structures in the colony theyre mostly modular right
theyre all modular most deuterium fields are depleted within three or four years at most it forces us to be itinerant
so youre saying you could relocate these buildings in a relatively short time
it depends where youre suggesting we relocate them
about fifty metres to the south right here
what good would that do the terrain there is no different than where the town is now
thats what were counting on if we can move the structures and the rigs everything should look pretty much like it did yesterday
everything except the wellheads
theyll have to be capped off and camouflaged
we can do that
the gullies on this hillside are they deep enough to hide in
if you keep your head down
well shuttle small groups to enterprise for whatever training we have time for preferably people who have experience with weapons
weve got three days we should get to work
what are we waiting for
one more metre okay shut her down
you ready
and begin
shiba lizards dont move that fast
do you mind lieutenant
i can see your finger tensing on the trigger before you fire its throwing off your aim i used to make the same mistake keep your eye on the target and dont squeeze the trigger until you have a clear shot
try again
i think the table was a little bit to the left
thanks how are things going with the pumps
itll be tomorrow before theyre all in place we started capping off the heads
let me know
i got it if you need more people
i rigged two ignition sequences the perimeter and the centre are on separate circuits
i thought taking the town apart was tough but putting it back together
this plan is a long shot isnt it
do you think its a mistake
i didnt say that
ive never liked bullies trip not on earth and not out here
klingons carry disrupters but they prefer to use bladed weapons in combat the two most common being the batleth a curved bilateral sword and the mekleth a twopronged dagger the batleth can decapitate its victim with one stroke while the mekleth is typically used to slash the throat or disembowel i cannot teach you to defend yourselves against these weapons the vulcan martial art suus mahna takes years to master however i can teach you a simple evasive technique ensign mayweather
since i dont have a batleth this will have to suffice
try to strike me you wont hurt me
its not you that im worried about
that was called the navorkot it isnt difficult to learn who would like to try first
thanks
lieutenant reed said id have to hide in the canyons when the klingons come back
he doesnt want you to get hurt
but i want to help i can shoot a shiba lizard from forty metres
malcolms got this rule youve got to be taller than the gun to use it
i dont want to hide
shooting at a lizard is a whole lot different than shooting at a person and lizards dont shoot back when those klingons show up i want you to do exactly what lieutenant reed says understood
yes sir
we had a little trouble moving one of the pumps but its in place now were ready
i just hope everyone survives this your people as well as mine
we left earth just over a year ago to explore to meet people like you wed only been out of spacedock for three days when we found ourselves in a fullfledged firefight with some pretty nasty characters called the suliban i got shot in the leg just before i passed out i remembered thinking this isnt what i signed up for i should be mapping star clusters or making first contact with friendly species but when those suliban started firing at my crew i knew i didnt have any choice but to fight back im not ashamed to admit i was nervous im nervous now but i know we can do this  archer
the klingon ship just dropped out of warp captain
acknowledged
listen
what
the pumps theyre silent  wheres your hospitality this is no way to treat your friends show yourselves
this will cost you more than deuterium
ptaq
hey
come on
there
what are you doing youll kill us all those wellheads theyre under great pressure if you ignite them youll incinerate the entire town
theyre making fools of us
theyre hiding in the dirt like targ theyll learn to show us respect well kill another four perhaps the boy as well
captain
theyre too far south
weve got to get them to move fifty metres to our left
everybody this way
a little farther this is good
a few more metres
this shouldnt be here
now
theyre all yours tessic
korok
i wouldnt do that theres two more wellheads by your feet leave here now or well ignite them
ptaq youll live to regret this
if youre thinking about coming back i wouldnt advise it well be ready were not afraid of you anymore
we can find deuterium anywhere yours isnt fit for a garbage scow
unless youre planning to join starfleet im afraid youll have to give up that chair
i wish you didnt have to leave
yeah thats one of the tough things about my job saying goodbye to people like you and your friends oh almost forgot
schematics for enterprise you said you like to look at starships this onell knock your socks off
thanks do you think youll come back
who knows our engines need a lot of deuterium
there must be over a thousand litres here
two thousand
our deal was for two hundred
our deal was for power cells medical supplies and repair work you provided us with much more than that
besides we seem to have a surplus at the moment
give your crew our thanks
have a good season
subcommander
yes
did i wake you
its all right is something wrong
weve located menos
where
less than three days from your present location
are you certain its him
yes
come in
good morning
captain
toast
no thank you
what can i do for you
admiral forrest will be calling you this afternoon sir
oh will he and how would you know that
i was contacted by the vulcan high command last night theyve requested my services regarding a matter of security
and theyve already asked admiral forrest
he should be contacting you this afternoon
matter of security
the admiral will inform you that enterprise will be asked to alter course to the pernaia system where i will need a shuttlepod and a pilot for three to five days
you didnt answer my question what kind of matter of security
a vulcan ship will rendezvous with the shuttlepod when my mission is completed
theyre sending you to get somebody somebody youll be handing over to the vulcans why you
admiral forrest will be contacting you this afternoon
thanks for being so enlightening dismissed
did you find the coordinates
pernaia prime yes sir
set a course when we arrive youll be piloting the shuttlepod
where exactly will we be going
somewhere in the pernaia system no doubt as far as the exact location admiral forrest doesnt even know that it seems the subcommanders on a highly classified mission
is this pernaia prime inhabited
the vulcan database says it has a methanebased atmosphere
so shes going to another planet in the system are we supposed to play some kind of guessing game
no were supposed to wait at pernaia prime for tpol and travis to finish their mission
and do what in the meantime
i could use a few days to recalibrate the torpedo launchers
i could polish all the handles and rails in engineering
i guess i could purge the impulse reactors
its only for a few days weve got plenty to keep ourselves busy is there anything specific you and travis are going to need
coldweather gear restraints and phase pistols
come in
if the vulcan high command doesnt approve of the water polo match im watching id be happy to find another
your orders to bring me to pernaia came from starfleet not the high command
what can i do for you
i have a personal matter id like to discuss
before i joined the science directorate i was assigned to the ministry of security i was trained in reconnaissance and retrieval
move over porthos let the lady sit down sounds like this is going to be good come on sit down
how long ago are we talking about
i completed my training seventeen years ago
go ahead
are you familiar with a planet called agaron
theyre close allies with the vulcans right
not always agaron was a very corrupt world when their leaders were first trying to forge an alliance with vulcan they asked for our assistance that was nearly thirty years ago hundreds of our agents were surgically altered and sent to infiltrate the most criminal factions of agaron society eventually they were instrumental in the overthrow of those factions
youre not going to tell me youre one of those agents
im not that old captain after the alliance was formalised the vulcan agents were recalled they all returned voluntarily all but nineteen
i guess even vulcans can fall prey to temptation
the ministry of security sent a team of newlytrained operatives to retrieve them i was only able to apprehend five of the six fugitives assigned to me
so tomorrow you get to pick up number six why couldnt someone else do it why you
the ministry considers it a matter of honour
how very vulcan so why have you decided to tell me all this
id like you to come with me
what
the man im being sent to apprehend is extremely dangerous it would be wise for me to have assistance
you said theres a vulcan ship coming im sure they can provide all the assistance youll need
id prefer it if youd come with me captain
why
i need to be with someone i can trust if you dont wish to help me i understand good night
whats his name the man were going to apprehend
menos
see you in the morning
if you agreed to go with her you must know something about what shes up to
well be back in three to five days trip if that vulcan ship comes snooping around the last thing you want to tell them is that im with tpol
whys that why would you being with her be a problem to them
three to five days trip
come on captain last night you were just as frustrated as i was about having to sit on your hands while she goes off and does whatever it is shes going off to do
this isnt just a case of curiosity what if you get hurt kidnapped you put me in charge of this ship and you wont tell me where youre going how am i supposed to be a good temporary captain if i dont know where my people are tell me that
shes got some unfinished business trip im not sure why but she needs me to go along well be okay
there are a lot of definitions of unfinished business could you be a little more specific
youre in charge commander  have you given travis the coordinates
yes
have fun
before he was sent to agaron the dorsal lobes of his ears were surgically altered the ridge on his forehead was added sometime afterward
why didnt he want to come home
he was assigned to infiltrate a cell of smugglers he learned their craft he became very proficient at it amassed a large fortune
smuggling what
synthetic biotoxins used to manufacture transgenic weapons i spent three months trying to find him he used his wealth wisely whenever id get close id find hed left a day or two before
you never found him
only once on risa they thought they were invulnerable
they
he he thought he was invulnerable there that no one would think to look for him on such a peaceful place
what happened
i got very close twenty metres maybe ten
tpol
i never found him again no one did not until now
hes here
where
within thirty metres
if he sees tpol he may try to get to his ship
he saw me
which way
im not certain
i couldnt agree more
dont move
you have no jurisdiction here
follow me
come in gentlemen come in glad you could join me
water polo
very exciting sport you should learn more about it
please sit down i had chef prepare a special lunch bangers and mash for you and denobulan sausage for the doctor
very nice
are you sure the captain wouldnt have a problem with you using his dining room
acting captain captains mess i dont see a problem thank you crewman
enjoy
thank you oh i detected a lymphatic virus on board this morning most likely it sneaked in with one of the deuterium canisters we should probably inoculate the crew
why didnt the bioscanners detect it
well its a very reliable device but its not perfect the inoculation does have some side effects
what kind of side effects
headache nausea diarrhoea but they would subside in a day or two do i have your permission
id hate to be responsible for giving the crew the runs maybe you should wait till the captain gets back
im afraid the virus will have spread by then i really need an answer today
why dont i get back to you later doc
not too much later
while were on the subject of approvals i promised captain archer that id recalibrate the torpedo launchers ill need to divert computer access from main engineering
that would mean wed have to power down the warp core
itll only be for a day were not exactly going anywhere
were also not at war im just not comfortable taking the engines offline right now
is that the chief engineer talking or the acting captain
let me get back to you  tucker
we were just hailed by the vulcan ship nyran sir its approaching the system at high warp theyre asking to speak with captain archer
tell them the captains indisposed at the moment hell get back to them in a little while
yes sir
the captain said not to tell the vulcans he went with tpol he was very emphatic about that
its going to be difficult to convince them hes indisposed for the next four days
go ahead
captain tavek says he has a message from admiral forrest he seems very anxious to speak with captain archer what shall i tell him
ill get back to you
your warrant is valid but you wont be able to take him not for at least four hours weve begun thermalising the landing deck
we just need to get him to our ship
theres a half centimetre of xylathoric acid on that deck i wouldnt recommend it not if you value those pretty feet of yours
do you have somewhere we can put him until we leave
does this look like a prison to you
any one of these people could be working with him
the ministry of security very clear about that he works alone
i havent always
youre human and you as well they wanted to rehabilitate me bring me home flatten my forehead and repoint my ears they wanted to teach me to forget the life they had taught me so carefully how to live they assumed i had become corrupt and that left to my own devices i would remain corrupt three years in a vulcan clinic rehabilitation can you blame me for running im not a thief im not a smuggler i never was i worked with smugglers i worked very close with them for a long time its what i had been trained to do do you know how ive survived the last twenty years how ive fed my family i haul spent warp injector casings not a very popular occupation but a necessary one a doctor on andoria says that my hemolytic cell count is over three thousand you dont find too many old men hauling spent injector casings in my left front pocket if you dont mind
i wouldnt it may be a weapon
its a hologram of my family they wont hurt you
the injector casings are going to take me away from them soon enough i dont want to die in a vulcan prison
the information that i was given says that you buy high grade biotoxins and sell them to anyone who will meet your price
if all of the ministrys reports about me were true i could easily shapeshift and slip out of these restraints or sprout wings and fly to my ship
why should she believe a fugitive and not her own government
because her government sent one hundred nine agents to agaron thirty years ago and they want all one hundred nine accounted for right or wrong dead or alive
if youre innocent im sure youll be given a chance to defend yourself
bur im guilty im guilty of not returning when i was told to im innocent of selling biotoxins but im guilty of being a fugitive but i dont deserve to go to prison and i dont deserve to be shot
were here to take you to vulcan no ones going to shoot you
what about her
youre a liar
tpol
what are you doing tpol
hes not telling the truth
where the hell are you going tpol
he says he has a ship full of injector casings
but the platforms covered with acid
jossen
youre sure
theres no record of them ever having spoken but i cant be certain
has he ever been to earth
if he has the vulcan database doesnt mention it
i hope they havent put starfleet yearbook photos into that database lets get this over with
captain archer
yes is there a problem
you seem very young for a starfleet captain
healthy living you have a message from admiral forrest
im not certain what this means but the admiral asked me to inform you that cal beat stanford seven to three
ill be sure to tell him
tell who
im afraid its confidential thank you for relaying the message archer out
that wasnt too smart you could have been hurt what did you find
spent injector casings
youll have to go through decon when we get back
i want to speak to menos alone would you allow me to do that
come on travis lets see if we can find something to eat
who is jossen
you didnt find what you were looking for did you
who is jossen
if this is your idea of humour
tell me who he is
jossen was no different than me he didnt want to be rehabilitated either
where did i meet him
meet him on risa jossen and i were on risa in the tropical zone we were innocent of the crimes the ministry had accused us of but we were running all the same why do you want me to tell you things you already know
youre telling me lies
no the truth
i followed you to risa no one else i bribed the tellarite transport captain who brought you there he told me exactly where to find you i wasnt looking for anyone else
then why are you asking me about jossen he never hurt anyone he didnt deserve to be hunted down like an animal
i killed him
yes and he didnt deserve to be killed he was an innocent man just like i am
you really dont remember how is that possible why did you kill him he never would have hurt you
stop talking
youre a vulcan youre trained to repress the emotion of killing not the memory of the act
i said stop talking
look what its done to you taking an innocent life bringing me back to vulcan will be no different youll be destroying another life how will that affect you will you conveniently forget what youre about to do to me
wheres menos
get back over there
aye sir
what happened
there were seven
seven what
i was sent to bring back seven fugitives not six
i dont understand
menos had a partner or a friend im not sure his name was jossen i followed them both to risa not just menos the day i told you i saw menos and lost him i saw jossen as well they tried to escape jossen fell to the ground he began to reach for his weapon
but you fired first
i had forgotten all of it until today
how
have you heard of the fullara
no
its an obsolete vulcan ritual where the memory of an event is repressed along with the emotions associated with it
and you had this
fullara
this fullara ritual performed
when i returned to vulcan i was unsettled i resigned my position with the ministry and sought guidance at the sanctuary of pjem for months one of the elders worked with me to control the guilt to restrain the despair of having taken a life but the feelings remained
why would you feel guilty if this jossen was about to fire at you
i suppose i was never certain what his intentions were the elder had no choice but to perform the ritual when i left the sanctuary i didnt remember anything about jossen or the fullara
when did it start coming back
when the first call came in about this new mission maybe thats why i wanted you with me what if jossen wasnt a smuggler what if he was innocent then it wouldnt have mattered whether he intended to use that weapon or not
that doesnt make any sense whats menos been telling you
menoss ship was filled with injector casings nothing else he has a family our scans should be able to confirm if hes dying of radiation poisoning
whats he been telling you
he kicked over the table
and you claim youre a peaceful man
ironic isnt it burning to death on a frozen moon but id rather die here than be brought back and punished for crimes i never committed
tpol
refasten them
wheres menos
travis come on
wheres his ship your mission is to return him to vulcan not determine whether hes guilty or innocent wheres his ship
hes not aboard
lets be sure
well all need to go through decon now
hes not here
was that the only way in go back to the cockpit travis
aye sir
get life support fired up if you can its pretty cold
he shouldve gotten here before us this ship shouldnt be here
why risk using his own vessel hed know wed follow him
so he couldve left with any one of those other ships
any one of them
you seem okay with that
when we return to enterprise ill inform the vulcan ship that menos escaped if the high command wishes they can question as many of the vessels that left here as they can find
youre giving up a lot easier than i wouldve guessed
hes obviously gone
we dont know that he got to you didnt he youre beginning to doubt yourself he figured if he could get you to question what you did seventeen years ago youd begin to question what youre doing right now
i may have killed an innocent man seventeen years ago
did jossen reach for his weapon or not
i dont know
is that what you remember or what menos wants you to remember
whats the difference
theres a big difference hes playing on your guilt dont you see that
thats impossible i went to pjem they performed the ritual
dont give me that your emotional immune system started to collapse again the minute you remembered what happened that day on risa
captain
what is it travis
theres something funny up here sir think you could take a look
whats up
after i got the board running i brought life support up to level three as soon as i got more light in here i noticed some condensation on this subpanel
theres a hell of a lot of energy flowing through those circuits any idea what they are
our scanner showed everything powered down
well obviously somethings powered up theres one way to find out what it is
im a very patient man tpol
i was simply waiting for you to leave but your captains curiosity has put an end to that would you please lower your weapon
theres some kind of energy field running
i dont want to harm tpol captain but i will
those are violent words for a peaceful man
at the moment im a man who needs to survive theres a locker right next to you i want you to both put your weapons down and then walk into it you wont be hurt
what about her
tpol is my guarantee that the two of you will walk quickly and quietly into the locker please
the locking code is one six six one theres a very specific tone when its entered properly
you okay
yes
we dont do quickly and quietly very well but we are good at arithmetic it seems there are three of us and only one of you
stop please
i dont trust this guy travis find something to tie him up with
aye sir
what are you doing
get up
stop
youre not going to shoot me tpol youre not going to kill another innocent man this is none of your concern captain you know nothing about what happened on risa
captain
why did you want me here
because i trust you
then trust me you were sent to apprehend him not to judge him
hes not going to get out of that too quickly
i think i know why he was so nervous about us firing at him while he was over here look at this
biotoxins if one of our weapons had struck this
i guess he was hauling more than injector casings after all
i guess he was
whats your status trip
everythings ready to go captain welcome back
thanks well be going to warp three
you got it
now that your secret mission is over you think you can give your chief engineer a little hint about what you were up to
did i say warp three i meant warp four commander
not even a hint warp four aye captain
come in
subcommander am i about to get another call from admiral forrest
no sir
sorry dealing with these memories its not going to be easy for you is it
no its not
if you feel you need a leave of absence
that wont be necessary i was much younger then
youve also spent a lot of time around humans lately
you do have a way of putting questionable actions behind you
when you dont have the ability to repress emotions you learn to deal with them and move on was there something else
if you ever need someone you can trust
i wont forget
i need to spend more time in the gym
if i knew there were going to be so many hills i would have picked a different city to explore
it was worth every step sir the architecture alone
i could have spent all day in that temple
with your permission captain id like to write        the report to starfleet it was my first visit to a prewarp culture seems only fitting
i dont suppose it has anything to do with the tactical situation down there
am i that obvious
i cant think of a better man for the job
welcome home
any unexpected guests
not a single parasite spore or virus i take it your expedition was productive
very
youre done here
you know as interesting as that was its always good to get home
the speaker at the political rally what was his name chancellor kultrey
kultarey
you could write a book about him alone his speech reminded me of winston churchill before the second world war
something wrong malcolm
my communicator
what about it
its gone
its not in decon any luck
none yet
what about the launch bay crew could they have found it while they were securing the pod
ive already spoken to them
i did everything but tear up the floor plating
when was the last time you remember having it
i contacted tpol to let her know wed entered the city
after that did you have any reason to take it out of your pocket
no
are you sure
id remember either i dropped it or someone picked my pocket
we covered a lot of ground it could be anywhere
i think i can narrow down the search captain an inverse carrier wave should amplify its        power signature with any luck ill be able to isolate it
im getting something ive got it down to two square kilometres
can you do a little better
ill try
didnt you say something about a war brewing down there
we saw a lot of propaganda but from what we could tell nobody started fighting yet
its crucial we retrieve the technology we cant risk contaminating a prewarp culture
ive isolated the signal to within three city blocks thats the best i can do sir
this lshaped structure isnt that the fountain the one with the statues the tavern was        directly across the street here the communicator could have slipped out of my pocket when we sat down
its a good place to start  youve got the bridge tell doctor phlox were going to need        his cosmetic services again
you could use another set of eyes down there captain
i appreciate the offer trip but the fewer set of eyes the better
im a regular bloodhound
next time
well be in range of their surveillance towers in less than two minutes
the hull platings already been polarised
your feet ready for another hike
its not a problem sir captain my carelessness was inexcusable im prepared        for whatever reprimand you feel is appropriate
how about thirty years in the brig or maybe a good flogging
sir
it was an accident malcolm it could have happened to any of us
three military aircraft seventy two kilometres off starboard i suggest you increase our descent vector        that should keep us well below their visual threshold
this was the table
positive
try your scanner
welcome back what would you like
can you give us a few minutes
of course wheres your friend the young woman
you have a good memory
she was difficult to forget
ill pass along the compliment
do you live here
no just visiting
we received a shipment of allakas malt this afternoon
sounds good
ive got it
where
its in a room off that corridor
were you in there
no
there are two people inside
better wait till they come out
does this belong to you what is it
i dont know
what kind of weapon is this  wheres general gosis
on the eastern perimeter
send a level four communiqué and tell him i think weve found a pair of enemy spies       take them to the complex and put your men on alert you wont be seeing your friends in the alliance for a long time
im telling you somethings gone wrong we should hail them
if theyre in a public place the communicator would draw attention
well have to take that risk tpol to captain archer
the comm lines open
captain please respond close the channel
did you get a fix on the signal
somewhere in this district
thats more than thirty kilometres from the tavern wheres the shuttlepod
it hasnt moved
they couldnt have travelled that far on foot not that fast
maybe they took a train or a car
if there was a change of plan they wouldve told us
try to isolate their biosigns i want to know exactly where they are
there are nearly a hundred thousand people in that part of the city
wed have more luck if we moved into a lower orbit
any closer and wed be detected do your best
still bothering you
i didnt have time to visit the doctor i wonder if the guard would bring us some epsom salts       if i asked politely
i wouldnt count on it
we came down to retrieve my communicator now weve lost two of them not to mention my phasepistol and a pair       of scanners
i just hope they dont find the shuttlepod
if they really think we are spying for this alliance perhaps we should consider telling them the truth
im not sure anyone would believe us
it couldnt hurt to try
visitors from another world theres no way to know how theyd react the less we say the better
understood
follow me
which of you is the captain something unexpected happened when i was examining this transmitter       it began to make a sound so i opened it someone calling herself tpol seemed very concerned about       her captains wellbeing which one of you was she trying to contact
im the captain
the alliance must be growing desperate if theyre recruiting military officers as spies
were not part of the military
i suppose youre the captain of a pleasure boat this transceiver whats its frequency its range
i dont know
this appears to be a computing instrument tell me how does it work
my superiors expect answers as an officer im sure you can appreciate that       i have no desire to harm you but i need you to cooperate
im sorry i cant help you
i trust you enjoyed the rally this morning thats why youre here isnt it       its curious the two of you visiting the city the same day as chancellor kultarey       did you come here to observe his security arrangement or perhaps assassinate him       were aware of your ancestral claims against our city it must make a tempting target
were visitors not spies
this tpol who tried to contact you where is she
youve been surgically altered
general his blood its red
take them to temec have him perform a full examination
theyre here inside this compound
guard towers gun emplacements its not a hotel
we could take shuttlepod two set it down here theyre being held less than thirty metres away       wed be back in orbit before anyone knew they were gone
if you were captured youd be giving the inhabitants more technology       it would undoubtedly affect the evolution of their society
what if they didnt see us coming weve still got that suliban cellship the one we used to rescue       klaang from the helix ive been working on it in my free time im pretty close to figuring out how it works       if i can bring the cloak on line we can get past their defences grab our people and no one will see a thing
work quickly
i could use a hand
aye sir
i suggest we monitor the communiqués coming from the compound they may tell us whats happening       to the captain and mister reed
right away
i dont get it the power converters engaged juice is definitely flowing through these relays       so why can we still see the ship
maybe this panel isnt the cloaking device
ive identified every other component its got to be it run the powerup sequence again
this would be a lot easier if there was a button marked cloak
hold on a minute travis
are you all right
just got the wind knocked out of me a bit
maybe a little more than that
is there any pain
it tingles a little
can you move your fingers
hows that
you tell me
they feel all right whats your scanner say
very little im afraid quantum physics is hardly my specialty but id guess that you       received an intense dose of whatever particle radiation that ship uses to conceal itself
are you saying im permanently cloaked
its difficult to determine but i suspect your appendage will eventually rematerialise on its own
eventually
come back in an hour ill check on your progress
what am i supposed to do in the meantime i cant work like this
id also recommend a fresh uniform
thanks
shall we try this
its some kind of coherent energy pulse i thought this technology was only theoretical
our alliance friends seem to have turned theory into reality
may i
there appears to be another setting
if the alliance has equipped its troops with these weapons make sure the devices are kept       under guard at all times use men you can trust
what did you find
see for yourself
how is this possible
theres only one explanation our prisoners belong to another species
doctor temec tells me your deformities are not the work of a surgeon he found no obvious incisions or scar tissue       youre even more abnormal on the inside a redundant renal organ and youre missing four thoracic vertebrae       temec cant even begin to explain this mass as for your red blood the doctor tells me your haemoglobin       is based on iron a toxic element he conducted the test four times to be certain       he has a theory about where you came from i found it difficult to believe until i saw this       one of our surveillance aircraft took this image early this morning       the pilot said the object was traveling at very high speed can you explain
none of the other planets in our system are capable of supporting life where do you come from
our scientists tell me its unlikely that a craft of this size could have travelled from another star system       they suspect a larger ship must be somewhere nearby perhaps orbiting our planet
tell me your orders have you made contact with the alliance
answer me
our intelligence reports underestimate you general alien creatures youre even more delusional than we thought       this isnt a spaceship its suborbital a highly experimental aircraft weve been observing your territory for months
how did you evade our surveillance towers
its made from a composite alloy invisible to any of your tracking systems
and your biological anomalies
weve been genetically enhanced
what kind of enhancements
our immune systems are resistant to chemical and biological weapons and our internal organs have been       modified to increase cellular regeneration by thirty percent that way our wounds can heal more quickly
create the perfect soldier
how many of you are there
were prototypes the only ones
and your devices are they prototypes as well
all of them
take them back
do you believe them
its a plausible explanation
the alliance could have thousands of soldiers with these mutations
we need to verify what theyve told us
i ran every imaginable test if i were to extract the organs i could study them in more detail
youll be in charge of the execution ill inform the prisoners
subcommander another communiqué its from a general gosis to the chancellor he said theyve       captured two enemy spies theyre going to hang them
reconnect the diffraction relays and well give it another shot
any change
still missing in action
having a cloaked hand could have its advantages be useful in a poker match
i could probably become a worldclass magician
it might be helpful on movie night if you bring a date in case you want to steal some popcorn
lets try it again
go ahead
is it working
not exactly shut her down the cloaking generators running at a hundred and ten percent       and its still not enough lets route more power from the warp relays maybe that will do the trick
how soon can you launch
were still reconfiguring the power matrix but im pretty confident
you dont have time theyre going to be executed in less than two hours
well get it working on our way down if we have to look invisible or not       this cell ship can take more of beating than our shuttlepod
youre about to find out prepare it for launch
an upset stomach do you really think hed fall for that
well it may be an old trick where we come from but maybe they havent heard of it here
even if we got out of the compound wed never make it to the shuttle not looking like this       genetic enhancements very creative malcolm
thanks improvisation isnt my strong suit
you made us sound like the suliban
what do you suppose enterprise will do after were
if i know tpol she wont want to leave any contamination behind it may take some time       but shell find a way to get everything back including our remains
its ironic giving our lives to protect people who want to kill us
its a big planet malcolm im sure theyre not all like that
im not afraid sir
what if we did tell them the truth
you said it yourself captain theyd never believe us
if we show them to the shuttlepod bring the general up to enterprise give him the grand tour       top it off with dinner in the captains mess wed probably all have a good laugh over how he       almost sent us to the gallows ive gotten plenty of lectures on cultural contamination but       tpol never mentioned anything about sacrificing crewmen to prevent it
if we did tell them who we are maybe it would do them a world of good look what the vulcans did for earth
that was different these people havent even split the atom yet the vulcans waited until we were ready       until we had the ability to travel to other stars were doing the right thing malcolm       im sorry you wont get a chance to write that report
it could still happen sir im expecting a rescue party to come barging through that door any moment
well be in range of those surveillance towers in less than two minutes
theyll never see us coming
on your feet
what was that
theres a power drain in the cloaking generator
are the warp relays offline
primary and backups
the weapon nodes are active i thought we diverted power from the secondary systems
we did
they may have been programmed to reactivate when we launched
three military aircraft off our port side theyre on an intercept course
travis cant you hold this thing steady
itd be a lot easier if they stop firing at us
commander
stand by
hes my tactical officer he can tell you everything you want to know about the alliances troop deployments       their weapons
captain
you dont need to kill him
your rides here
sir the phase pistol our equipment
dont leave without me
lets go
the shuttlepods right where you left it sir well be there in two minutes
captain
sir looking for this
come in
i scanned the region ahead theres a blue giant cluster three light years from our current position
any planets
none that are inhabited
sounds like a nice change of pace have travis set a course
yes sir was there something else
you took a risk coming down in that cell ship its cloaking device could have failed
a calculated risk
im glad you did it whats important is that we got everything back the communicator the phase pistol       the shuttlepod we could have done a lot of damage to those people if wed left any of it behind
we did do damage to those people
weve changed their perception of the alliance
they now believe their enemy is capable of creating geneticallyenhanced soldiers not to mention particle weapons
and thanks to that suliban ship they also think the alliance has developed invisible aircraft
you dont have to leave technology behind to contaminate a culture  you were willing       to sacrifice your life to protect them i would not have expected that
you are making excellent progress
yeah what about this
thats nothing
maybe nothing to you
give it time give it time
thanks doc
im continuing my analysis of the condition thats stricken the crew without doctor phloxs assistance im not hopeful about reversing its effects im documenting my findings so that starfleet will at least have a record of what happened the symptoms began not long after we set a course for the trinary system that was nearly two days ago
youre sure its a black hole
a class four
according to the vulcan star charts your people have surveyed more than two thousand of these things
thats correct but none of them were part of a trinary star system
how close can we get
the gravitational shear between the stars is extreme wed have to drop to impulse but we should be able to approach to within five million kilometres
close enough to get some nice pictures
how long would it take to reach the system at impulse
two days
set a course
trip if youve got some free time id love it if you take a look at my chair
sir
the captains chair
whwhat about it
 you may have noticed that i dont sit in it very much
is there a problem
its uncomfortable when i lean back i feel like im about to slide out of it i have to sort of perch on the edge
i always assumed it was the best seat in the house
take a look at it for me
i was going to purge the impulse manifolds
the chair first if you dont mind
aye aye sir
come in
good morning
morning
am i interrupting
no no just thinking about something
todays duty roster
thanks
lieutenant reed has a new security protocol hed like to discuss with you
ill drop by the armoury anything else
chef didnt report for duty this morning hes ill
is it serious
doctor phlox said its a simple virus he should be fine after a few days rest ensign sato has offered to take charge of the mess hall apparently she spends some of her free time in the galley and is eager for an opportunity to cook for the crew
if its all right with chef let me ask you a question i received a manuscript from earth a biography of my father ive been asked to write the preface would you mind reading it when im done
id be happy to
if i can ever get it finished ive been putting it off for weeks
the next two days should provide you with ample opportunity
its not that i havent had the time they only asked for a page how am i supposed to sum up my fathers life in a page it wouldve been easier if theyd asked me to write the book
perhaps by focusing on one incident a single event that exemplifies your relationship with your father youll be able to condense your thoughts
a logical approach maybe youd like to write it for me
im hardly qualified
chef was planning to make fried chicken tonight with scalloped potatoes and some of the minaran spinach we picked up on risa
the orange spinach
hes convinced theres a way to make it edible
why dont we let him tackle that when he gets back i have something else in mind
its one of my grandmothers specialties the recipes been passed down for generations
ill need a translation before i can programme the protein resequencer
oh no you can resequence all the chicken and potatoes you want but i am making this from scratch
ensign is there something i can do for you
ive got a little headache nothing serious
why dont you let me have a look
i was hoping you could just give me something im right in the middle of upgrading the navigation sensors
it would be irresponsible to dispense medication without examining you first please any other symptoms dizziness blurred vision
no
how long have you had it
a couple of days on and off
well ive been meaning to have you drop by sickbay in any case to see if youve had any problems since i removed the neural implants you received at the repair station
you think it could have something to do with that
oh i never rule out anything then again it could be as innocuous as muscular tension on the other hand terrellian plague starts out with a simple headache then all manner of nasty things begin to happen
commander commander
push it forward thats good hold it there
commander
perhaps you could finish that later
this may not be as glamorous as a black hole but the captain gave me an order
he also requested detailed sensor readings of this trinary system
i thought vulcans had all this mental focus and discipline
we also have sensitive hearing
ill be in my quarters
well let you know when were done
keep those target discriminators aligned we dont want a torpedo mistaking one of our own nacelles for an enemy vessel
you asked to see me malcolm
i would have come to you captain
its no problem whats on your mind
ive been reviewing our encounters with hostile species the crews response has been admirable but i feel we can do better sir
and you have a proposal
ive been thinking about a ship wide emergency alert something a bit more comprehensive than battle stations were taking far too long to react to potential threats with a single order from you or an impact to the hull the plating could be polarised weapons brought online critical systems secured
i appreciate your concern malcolm but this isnt a warship
thats obvious sir during our last runin with the suliban we were unprepared for their boarding parties when the mazarites attacked they disabled our aft sensors with their first shot the list goes on
i can see that run this by the senior officers get some feedback and well talk again
yes sir
and malcolm dont call it battle stations think of something less aggressive
how is it
condition red
huh
what about condition red for the new security protocol
why dont you just call it security protocol
well thats not very dynamic
do you think a cup holders too much
i beg your pardon
for the captains chair he just wanted the seat adjusted but i figured as long as im working on it
just what the captain needs in a crisis a place to rest his beverage
im also upgrading the status displays hell be able to access tactical data from the armrest
if you really want to improve tactical readiness why dont you help me with this protocol
im a little busy right now malcolm
its a chair
its the captains chair its just as important as your reed alert
reed alert thats not bad
enjoying your lunch
yeah thanks it was terrific
its called oden every japanese family has their own way of preparing it
well it seems to be a big hit congratulations
thank you lieutenant you barely touched yours
it was lovely
ill get you a fresh bowl
thats not necessary
its no problem
please not hungry
are you sure theres nothing wrong with it
well it was a bit salty
salty
it tastes fine
well it just must be me then everybody else seems to be enjoying it
how much longer is this going to take
that depends
on what
hold still ensign
i have to get back to the bridge
im afraid you wont be returning to duty today
the captain needs those upgrades doctor
when it comes to medical matters my authority overrides the captains im keeping you overnight for observation
but your scans didnt show anything
thats what concerns me whatevers afflicting you may be laying dormant im going to run a full biomolecular scan to see if we can find where its hiding now lie back and dont move
when i was about eight years old my father took me on a tour of the warp five facility outside of bozeman montana he introduced me to the people he worked with scientists with names like tasaki and cochrane at the time i didnt realise the significance of those names or the significance of my fathers work  computer pause ill feed you in a minute computer resume recording in a way creating a stable warp field mirrored the the flux of emotions my father felt when he embarked on computer pause delete the last paragraph hell delete the whole thing  quiet
come in
heres your sensor interface whats the emergency
this trinary system is emitting some unusual radiation im trying to identify it
you dragged me up here so you could identify radiation
correct
you said it was urgent
i said it was important
i get it youre paying me back making me jump through hoops because i was making too much noise well youll be happy to know i moved the captains chair down to engineering so its nice and quiet on the bridge now
i prefer to work here ill need your assistance with this
werent you listening to me i dont have time to cater to your whims you want to get your name immortalized in the vulcan database get someone else to help you do it
are you feeling all right commander
i know you dont think this chair is important but youre wrong whats the most critical component on this ship the main computer the warp reactor uhuh its the crew and the most important member of the crew is the captain he makes life and death decisions every day and the last thing he needs to be thinking in a critical situation is gee i wish this chair wasnt such a pain in the ass
doctor
shush
when are you going to
wait
i have just enough time to shower and get changed
i havent discharged you ensign
i havent slept all night and im supposed to go on duty in fifteen minutes
i need to perform a cerebral microsection
a what
lie down
no more tests i have to get to the bridge
im giving you an order
if i dont finish those upgrades i could get a reprimand itll be in my permanent record
you have far more to worry about than a blemish on your record do you see there your cortical scan shows elevated levels of serotonin and several other neurotransmitters
what does that mean
ill let you know once ive completed the microsection
cant it wait until after my shift
absolutely not
if the captain doesnt think i can handle my duties ill be scrubbing plasma conduits on d deck for the next five years i could be courtmartialed
and what if youre carrying a protocystian spore and you infect the rest of the crew how will that reflect on you or what if you suddenly suffer a seizure at the helm because youve contracted andronesian encephalitis now there is something wrong with you ensign and i intend to find out what it is
not today not during my shift unless youre ready to tie me to a biobed im going back to my helm
at least let me give you an analgesic for the headache
thats all i wanted in the first place
if it gets any worse or you suffer any other symptoms return here immediately
what did you
ive been working on the new security protocol obviously the reactor must be secured immediately during a tactical alert
tactical alert
i considered your suggestion reed alert but it seemed a bit narcissistic
hand me that hyperspanner would you
ive also been working on a new alert signal tell me what you think  or this one  well which do you prefer
for what
a tactical alert
they both sound like a bag full of cats
well they were designed to get your attention
ill look this over and get back to you
i also need your help on an emergency shutdown procedure for the eps grid
i said ill get back to you
fine lets hope we dont suffer a catastrophic reactor breach in the meantime
malcolm one of your boys borrowed my laser micrometer if youre heading to the armoury could you get it back for me
ensign if we dont serve something soon were going to have a riot on our hands
is this too salty somethings not right hand me the kreetassan spice ill add it to the stock oh im out of carrots
there are twenty five people
carrots
with all due respect youve been cooking the same meal over and over again
i believe im in charge of the galley
i understand
youre relieved
maam
get out
lieutenant i need your
clearance code
i beg your pardon
what is your clearance code the armoury is a restricted area
even to the first officer
how do i know you are the first officer weve encountered species that can alter their appearance they could masquerade as any one of us ive issued codes to all senior officers to reveal if the ships been infiltrated by impostors
part of your new security protocol
it was sent to your console as a voiceencrypted command packet
i havent been to the bridge for several hours as i was saying i need assistance establishing a sensor interface in my quarters ive asked commander tucker but he became agitated it was uncharacteristic even for him have you noticed anything abnormal about his behaviour
why do you want to access the sensor array from your quarters
i was asked to run detailed scans of the trinary star system
i wasnt informed
it isnt a tactical issue lieutenant why are you armed
from now on security personnel are to wear side arms in all restricted areas
have you cleared this with the captain
its in my proposal
has he approved your proposal
ive been trying to get him to pay closer attention to security since we left spacedock but hes more interested in fraternising with the crew inviting them to breakfast and to watch water polo i intend to implement some longoverdue changes and if the captain wont approve them then ill go directly to starfleet command was there anything else
no
it wasnt long before i realized the odd behaviour wasnt limited to commander tucker in fact everyone i encountered was acting strangely growing consumed with matters that seemed trivial at best i also discovered that although i appeared to be immune the captain was not
what happened to my chair
did you know that this chair is the exact same model used on neptune class survey ships
is that why you called me down here
enterprise is the first warp five vessel in human history the pride of the fleet and youre sitting in a chair theyve been using on warp two ships for over a decade you deserve better so im starting from scratch im going to build you a throne stand right there i need to get a few parametric scans to get your exact dimensions this baby is going to fit like a glove
isnt that used for aligning phase coils
you wont feel a thing
as long as im down here maybe i can get your opinion
dont move
how does one measure a mans legacy is it defined by the works hes created the technological advances that will forever alter the course of human history
turn around
if so then no man since zephram cochrane himself has made a more lasting contribution to the future of humankind than my father doctor henry archer
all done
what do you think
sounds good
let me read you the rest
i really need to get to work on this
its just a few more pages
how many more
nineteen
nineteen are you writing the preface or the book
ive got a lot to say
no kidding
whats that supposed to mean
if i may sir its a little longwinded
youre lucky youre a decent engineer because you obviously dont know anything about writing
im not the only one
i have eighty three people to feed not just senior officers
all i requested was a bowl of plomeek broth
i dont have time for special orders anyway youll like this better
wheres lunch
itll be ready in one minute sir
i dont have a minute
if youre so hungry fix yourself a sandwich
captain may i speak with you
that is a very complex recipe i will not serve it till its just right my familys reputation is at stake
this is a tactical alert all hands report to your stations i repeat this is a tactical alert
report
the crews response was unacceptable thirty eight percent of them failed to report to their stations critical systems havent been secured i havent even heard from engineering
shut off that damn noise shut it off i dont recall authorising a tactical drill
it wouldnt be much of a drill if everybody knew about it sir one minute and fifteen seconds
what
it took you one minute and fifteen seconds to reach your post id expect more of our commanding officer given that the crew just might follow his example
captain
one minute and forty nine seconds
you might want to see this sir
interactive status displays secondary helm control its even got inertial microdampers the ship could be shaking apart and youd hardly feel a thing
you ignored a tactical alert for this
i want to run some colours by you for the headrest
this is all a big joke to you
give it a rest
this isnt a bloody pleasure cruise without proper discipline on this ship this mission is doomed
why dont you go play soldier somewhere else
if this were a military situation youd be taken out and shot
hey hey hey hey
i dont care what colour the headrest is or whether it can serve me iced tea i just want a place to sit when im on duty
and if i hear that alarm one more time i may have you taken out and shot  unless theres a real emergency like a reactor breach i dont want to be disturbed
go away
do i have to start locking my door
you said to interrupt you if there was an emergency i believe there is
is that right
the crews behaviour has become erratic even by human standards theyve grown distracted everyone ive encountered appears to be preoccupied with trivial matters ensign satos recipe for example your preface we should declare a medical emergency and have doctor phlox examine the crew i suggest he begin with you
im busy
captain
dismissed
your crew is in danger
i gave you an order
captain
i suggest you follow it or ill have you confined to your quarters until until a vulcan ship can come and get you
youre just in time subcommander theres a surgical gown in the compartment by the microscope this is a rare opportunity to explore the human brain
was he injured
a headache at first i thought it was a simple vascular dilation but then i discovered a chemical imbalance in his prefrontal cortex im going to begin by extracting the first twelve millimetres of his parietal lobe a subcellular analysis of the tissue should shed some light on the mystery
doctor you may want to delay the procedure we have a larger problem the entire crew is ill
theyll have to wait
youve been affected as well
please remove your hand
i wont ask you again  ill let you know when ive completed the surgery
the crews biosigns were growing erratic i began to doubt any of them would survive more than a few hours
ironically dr phloxs obsession with ensign mayweathers headache has provided some useful data his cerebral scans have helped me determine that the radiation coming from the trinary system is causing  computer pause
computer resume log my radiometric analysis is complete as i suspected reversing course wont take us out of danger quickly enough the radiation appears to extend outward at least half a light year in every direction except one if i can chart a course between the stars we could escape the radiation before the crew succumbs but i wont be able to pilot the ship alone
captain captain archer youre needed on the bridge
i told you not to disturb me
we have very little time
what are you doing
your crew may be dying
what
do you remember that trinary star system
the one with the black hole
its emitting a dangerous form of radiation its affecting your prefrontal cortex
i believe thats why you and the crew have been exhibiting obsessive behaviour some of the crews biosigns are already unstable if youre exposed to the radiation much longer you wont survive
do you understand what im telling you
turn it off
do you understand
yes radiation tell phlox if the the crews sick tell phlox
hes been affected as well
but not you
vulcan physiology seems to be immune
bring us about turn the ship around
its not that simple if we go back the way we came well spend two more days in the radiation field ive charted a course thatll have us clear of the radiation in less than seventeen minutes
lousy coffee
but well have to pass within two million kilometres of the black hole theres considerable debris and gravitational shear someone needs to pilot enterprise while i determine the course corrections
travis
hes been sedated
im in no condition to fly a starship
we have no other choice
more gravitational shear were too far to port
but you said bearing two point four
twelve point four
my mistake twelve point four
how much longer is this going to take
six minutes
im good for that
another shear front we need to rotate our longitudinal axis by twelve degrees and bring our flight vector to zero one four mark two seven
hold on hold on zero what
zero one four mark
mark twoseven
just minor debris the hull plating is holding our lateral vector is drifting captain
hang on a second i feel like im in flight school again
youre doing well new heading zero zero six mark four
captain
i see it
we need phase cannons
theyd take too long to charge
all weapons are online it must be part of the new security protocol
fire
could you shut that off
how much longer
less than ten seconds five more seconds
any more surprises
nothing on sensors
did we get some nice pictures of the black hole
how are you feeling
a little tired but the headaches gone whatd you do
very little fortunately youre free to go
captain
hows the crew
oh im continuing to monitor vital signs but ive detected no lingering effects from the radiation mostly just rattled nerves a few bruises and sprains from when some of them lost consciousness i appreciate your intervening before i got any further with mister mayweathers procedure
i wasnt certain it would work on a denobulan
it worked quite effectively i can assure you
what procedure on mister mayweather
the radiation affected my nervous system rather severely
ill be with you in a moment ill provide you with a full report when ive finished treating the crew
you wanted to see me captain
i did when tpol and i were navigating the debris field your tactical alert went off
i heard sir ive already deactivated the new protocols
you shouldnt have they brought the weapons online right when we needed them if you have no objection id like to make it standard procedure
no objection sir
you still need to work on that alarm
ill get right on it
it doesnt look any different to me
give it a try
it feels better whatd you do
cross your legs
what did you do it seems totally different
i lowered it by one centimetre
thats all
didnt have time to install the new status displays or the inertial microdampers but if you give me a couple of days
i think thisll be fine commander thanks
how about i just attach the cup holder
thisll be fine
how does this sound
these are at least three hundred years older than the ones in the last chamber
you sure you cant read any of this
no how about you
well i think this says tall guys are popular
youre a budding linguist lets get a shot of that one
i wonder what happened to them
it is kind of weird not a single biosign on the entire planet  tucker
you about finished down there trip
you cant believe these ruins sir weve been through two dozen chambers no telling
how many more there are
im afraid youre not going to find out today that storm we told you about hasnt changed course
you and hoshi are going to need to get back to enterprise
well just finish up with mister tall and popular we should back to the shuttlepod in five six minutes
dont take any longer than that archer out
captain we have another storm
another one
the discharges are more intense
its a good deal bigger
and stronger its pushing the first storm through these mountains at twice the speed it was moving a few minutes ago
theyre diamagnetic storms captain saturated with polaric energy
this is the shuttle
less than ten kilometres from the first storm
you may not be able to see yet but itll be coming through the mountain pass to the north
we can see it just fine captain
the storms are throwing up too much interference into the atmosphere the shuttles out of the question
captain these ruins have very thick walls im sure well be safe inside
im afraid were not talking about thunderclouds hoshi a polaric burst that could shortcircuit a shuttlepod could do a lot worse to your nervous system
but sir these buildings are
over four thousand years old im sure theyve survived hundreds of these storms
ive sent malcolm down to the transporter were going to need to bring you up
one at a time
couldnt we wait it out inside the shuttle polarise the hull plating
that would most likely attract the polaric discharge
you have to do this hoshi
theres no choice ill need you clear of the structure
one at a time
understood captain ladies first
have you ever done this
no but the captain has and malcolm did it twice they said theres nothing to it
your molecules get pulled apart
then they get put back together again
do you know how many molecules youre made up of
lots
all right how many
a few trillion
thats a pretty big jigsaw puzzle what if some other pieces get put in the wrong place you know i bet a lot of them look real similar
starfleet said its safe thats good enough for me
okay okay but you go first and if you get to enterprise in one piece ill be right behind you
fair enough tucker to enterprise
i read you commander
ready to go
commander
safe and sound
im on my way sir
ensign sato ready for transport
welcome to the club
how do those molecules feel all in the right place
ill let you know
come in
no worse for the wear ensign
i guess you could say that sir ill be at my post in a few minutes i just want to clean up and change
i think youve had enough excitement for one afternoon the morningll be fine
thank you
i assume you and trip will want to finish your survey tomorrow weather permitting
sir
you left a shuttlepod down there remember somebodys got to go back and get it
im sure commander tucker can find someone else to hold the second flash unit
you wouldnt be using the transporter hoshi youd be taking the other pod
i dont want to get lost
lost
too much excitement for one day i could really use some rest sir
see you in the morning
so he tells her it was merely a warp imbalance
thats a lie malcolm
we all heard it commander theres no use pretending
come on travis
anyone sitting here
dont you think a vulcan would see right through this one
but thats what you said though
is anyone sitting here
no please
so what was it like
travis let her eat her supper
it was very unsettling didnt you find it unsettling
for a minute or two but once i counted my fingers and toes
i dont know i just dont feel right
it was probably that storm you dont forget things like that too quickly
not the storms its the transporter i dont feel like myself since i went through it i need to check the medical database and find out what happened to people they used when they were testing that thing
you mean other than cyrus ramsey
cyrus ramsey
dont tell me you dont know about poor cyrus
am i supposed to
you cant go on a survival overnight without hearing a story about someone seeing ramseys molecules rematerialising on a foggy night
what happened to him
next thing youll tell us you never heard of the easter bunny
what happened to him
madison wisconsin may i think 2146 he was a test subject for the first longrange transport just one hundred metres something went wrong with the pattern buffer he never rematerialised
come on hoshi everybodys heard of cyrus ramsey
i must have fallen asleep before the ghost stories
whered you do your survival training
death valley california middle of july naturally you
captain and i were in the same group alice springs australia never saw so many flies in my life biting kind  tucker
the storms are breaking up i dont think well have any trouble getting you back down in the morning
travis was just telling me hed like to see the ruins
well i dont think hoshi will be joining you
ill need a pilot to bring the other pod back
travis it is ill see you both in the morning archer out
never say i dont take you anywhere
you dont take me anywhere
see you later
doctor doctor phlox hello
ensign something i can do for you
i just looked in there were you in there did you hear me come in
i was feeding my leeches are you all right
you didnt hear me
im right here ensign are you not feeling well
no im not feeling well i dematerialised and then i rematerialised and no im not feeling well
i heard about your ordeal on the surface those storms sounded terrifying
doctor im not talking about the storms im talking about my molecules
come sit down lets take a look
itll take me a while to account for every molecule but you appear to be in one piece i dont think youre in danger of becoming the next cyrus ramsey
dont tell me they talk about him on denobula
i spent nearly nine months on earth remember
i just dont feel right ever since the transport ive been shaky not myself
not a single biomolecular anomaly
no how about this
a subcutaneous pigmentation
its not where it used to be it was a good centimetre lower
well it looks lovely where it is now
its not a joke doctor if that machine could move a birthmark who knows what else it could do im telling you i dont feel right
i have a lot of animals to feed before bedtime if i were you id get a good nights sleep hmm
hello
youre needed on the bridge ensign
what time is it
eleven hundred hours theres been an emergency
eleven hundred hours thats impossible my shift starts at oh eight hundred
now ensign
im sorry captain i dont know what happened
tucker and mayweather have been taken hostage trip got a short message but we havent heard anything in the last hour
taken hostage by who
the people down there didnt like you disturbing their ruins
people there wasnt a biosign on the planet
the chambers you and mister tucker photographed contained sacred relics
how could you possibly know that
have you found their biosigns
theyre still in the complex im trying to isolate the specific chamber
its mayweathers communicator
go ahead travis
ensign
i need more
this is captain archer of the starship enterprise we apologise if weve trespassed my crewmen didnt mean any harm
im sorry sir its not working im going to need more
can i speak to one of my officers
its not going to get much better than that
whats the problem
maybe you should forget about the ut just try and talk to them
ajas sukas
tag zra uras turana
if i went back to the universal translator maybe i could
you already tried that talk to them
i cant
lives are at stake ensign
i know i dont understand what hes saying im im sorry im sorry
no need to apologise why dont you go back to your quarters and get some rest
captain i realise i overslept i dont know how it happened but please i dont want to go back to my quarters
take the comm
aye captain
malcolm
anyone sitting here subcommander
ensign would you like to join me
thank you i wouldve thought youd be on the bridge
why is that
commander tucker travis
the hostage situation was resolved theyre back on board
its only been an hour since i left the bridge what happened
crewman baird deciphered their language a simple bimodal syntax
i dont understand how
with the universal translator
thats impossible i ran every linguistic algorithm
when the captain agreed to return the soil and rock samples and destroy the photographs that were taken the hostages were released
if weve decrypted their language i should get back to the bridge it sounds like the captain might want to speak with them again
captain archer has asked that you remain off duty for the time being crewman baird has been placed in charge of communications
after lunch you should take a look at the secondary couplings theyre going to need to be aligned
alison
start on c deck then work your way down
yes maam
the streams too unstable
come on hoshi
what
you can do it ensign its as easy as one two
can you see me
ensign
can you see me
is there something in particular youd like me to look at
somethings wrong doctor somethings very wrong ever since i used that transporter nothing has been the way that its supposed to be i couldnt translate a simple bimodal syntax but crewman baird could crewman baird doesnt know the first thing about our linguistic database and captain archer told me to stay in my quarters but my mirror doesnt want to give me a solid reflection and my shower cant decide whether to bounce off me or go through me nobody wants to talk to me sometimes i think they dont even see that im there the turbolift control wont even respond to me
well i see you ensign and the sickbay doors responded when you came in transporter technology is very new  im sure humans were equally frightened when the automobile was introduced or the airplane new forms of transport take a while to get used to im not at all surprised at your reaction you wouldnt catch me using that apparatus but i can promise you one thing youre in perfect health youre neither transparent nor porous
you wont put this on my medical record will you
as far as im concerned i didnt even see you come in here
not funny doctor
i would like to give you a mild sedative itll help you get a good nights sleep
if its all the same to you the last thing i need right now is to be medicated
as you wish but stop by in the morning all right
first thing thank you doctor
youre upside down ensign
i was taught never to contradict a superior officer the captain told me what happened did they treat you all right
didnt even tie us up as soon as the captain promised to give them their stuff back they walked us to the shuttlepods and away we went
im sorry i wasnt more helpful trying to translate i dont know what happened
well were safe and sound thats all that matters have you tried this thing
i get motion sickness remember have you felt okay since we were transported yesterday
considering that ive been back down to the surface kidnapped and released ive probably had better days why are you not feeling well
i didnt think i was but the doctor seems to feel my symptoms are psychological
what kind of symptoms
i just havent been myself everythings a little off even the laws of physics
well in that case youre right you shouldnt get on this thing the laws of physics dont apply in here either sorry just trying to cheer you up
its okay phlox promises me ill be fine
its going to be a while before any of us gets used to being taken apart and put back together again it seems perfectly natural to be anxious about it
i hope its just a question of being anxious
what else could it be
i saw my reflection become transparent i saw water pass right through my hand im not convinced that the transporter put me back the way it was supposed to
all the kings horses and all the kings men i can see why you might imagine the universe unraveling if youre afraid you havent been put back together right why assume anything else makes sense if i were you id ask the doc for a sedative nothing like crawling into bed
you men are all alike
wait and see a nights sleep will do you a world of good
thank god youre here ive been stuck in here for hours the door control is
she was here last night right over there
commander
tpol to captain archer
go ahead
have the security details reported back
no sign of her yet
weve covered the forward section of c deck shes not here
yes she is
have you tried the biosensors again captain
still nothing
ill go take a look at them
im going to maintain our present orbit until hoshi turns up tpol meet me in sickbay right away
yes sir
she came to sickbay after the incident with the storm then a second time early last night
she wasnt feeling well
she said she felt shaky youre aware that was the first time shed ever transported
quite aware
i believed that was the source of her anxiety she was convinced her molecules hadnt been reassembled properly i shouldve taken her more seriously these are the biomolecular scans i took during each of her two visits
they seemed perfectly normal at the time when i heard she was missing something made me take a closer look you see these protein filaments now look at this
im going to need some help here phlox
look how much her subcellular membranes have degraded these scans were taken less than twenty four hours apart its virtually impossible
whats impossible
ensign sato wasnt imagining it her molecules are coming apart
its the secondary phase coils
what about them
theyre not aligning theyre not perfectly synchronised mustve happened right after it came up from the surface
if theyre not perfectly synchronised
the resequencing would start to dissipate within hours shell lose molecular cohesion
she didnt want to go first i told her i wouldnt leave her alone with that storm coming but she insisted on going second she wanted to be sure it was working that it was safe im the one who should be missing i told her to go first she shouldve listened to me
it wasnt your fault
take the transporter offline and figure out what went wrong starfleet promised me this sort of thing wouldnt happen
aye sir
captain if there was a loss of molecular cohesion im afraid we shouldnt be looking for hoshi per se
what should we be looking for
subcellular residue there wouldnt be anything left by now except for subcellular residue
youre wrong doctor im still in one piece you just cant see me
have the doctor help you recalibrate the sensors then start scanning for this residue archer to mayweather
go ahead sir
prepare to break orbit and resume previous course
 aye captain
ill be in my ready room
theres no way to be certain this is her
is it hoshis dna or isnt it
its difficult to tell the amino acids have broken down
dont waste your time its not me
the internal scan said access shaft b7 shes got to be here somewhere
if you spent a little more time trying to figure out what happened to
whats the problem
the streams too unstable
lieutenant
you can do it ensign its as easy as one two
here doc over here what do you think
try isolating the dipeptides now run a comparison with her genetic profile
why would she have come down here
i doubt well ever know commander captain archer will want hoshis parents to have this
theyre both alive arent they
yeah both alive you go ahead doc im going to stick around for a minute
i understand
hoshi
you can see me
i shouldve made you go first what could i have been thinking leaving you down there i was the ranking officer and i had no business leaving a subordinate in the path of those storms why didnt you listen to me i told you wed be safe and now look what youve done
captain i need you to listen to me there are aliens on board from the surface theyre planting bombs on d deck youve got to hear me the ship is in danger
go ahead
weve located her father sir the mother isnt home
what time is it there
oh nine hundred
put him through
good morning sir
captain archer is everything all right
no sir everything is not all right weve had an accident with our transporting device
transporting device what is that
you dont have time for this
a matter stream converter it was approved for transporting biomatter before we left earth
ill find something thatll get your attention
weve used it a number of times to
biomatter what are you referring to produce or people
im just trying to explain to you that star fleet told us it was safe
so hoshi is safe
no sir there was an accident she began to her molecules began to destabilise
her molecules what are you talking about captain
this isnt easy sir i fought to get hoshi to come on this mission im responsible for her being out here shes become a member of our family
family were her family not you why are you calling me to say that she has become a member of your family im sorry captain you are not making any sense
we lost hoshi today mister sato i wish i didnt have to tell you that
you are saying hoshi is dead
were all going to be dead if i dont get him to notice this
maybe you could call us back later this afternoon
how about morse code you know morse code dont you
i must have time to speak to hoshis mother
come on listen
this afternoon
can you hear it
im so sorry
so am i
come on
thats right its not supposed to be making that noise is it listen you can hear it sos sos its a call for help i need you to hear it
archer to tpol
yes captain
could you come in here for a minute
right away
thats right show it to her one of you will figure it out
look at this ive never heard it make that noise before
the plasma circuits being interrupted ill ask commander tucker to take a look at it
listen to the pattern three dots three dashes three dots sos
dots
dots and dashes morse code its been used on earth for centuries its a distress call
lets see how good your memory is h o
its changed
s h
it still sounds like morse code
i come on
this plasma circuit is selfcontained no one outside of this room could be using it to send a message
im not outside this room im right here
its been a very difficult day perhaps you should try to get some rest
youre right ill have trip look at it tomorrow
tomorrows too late theyre going to blow up the ship captain
no wait
whats the problem
what
the streams too unstable
come on hoshi come on
you can do it ensign  its as easy as one two
three
nice work malcolm see i told you piece of cake
where are they weve got to stop them
who
you heard me you can hear me do you see me
everythings fine hoshi
its not fine they put a bomb on the warp reactor
who
the aliens from the surface
theres no one on the surface its uninhabited
what are you talking about they kidnapped you and travis weve got to stop them
hoshi the transporter was affected by the storms i had some trouble reintegrating your matter stream
trouble
you were sort of trapped in the pattern buffer but only for a few seconds
eight point three seconds to be precise
are you saying that i was just on the surface
you insisted on going second
do you have a mirror
what
forget it and i was sure i was going to be the next cyrus ramsey
cyrus who
so youre saying all of that happened in eight seconds
actually it probably happened in the last one or two seconds as your matter stream was coalescing she seems fine
malcolm is recommending some new transport protocols to star fleet hes suggesting we start compressing the transport beam
well i hope you dont plan on beaming me anywhere for a long time
but you said you stepped on to the aliens transporter by choice
i was trying to save enterprise
sounds like you overcame your fear
its all in my head remember
does it matter you were afraid of getting lost afraid of disappearing but you still climbed on to that platform real or not
if its all the same to you sir id like to stick to shuttlepods for the time being
come on lets go to the bridge
captain if you dont mind
archer to commander tucker
go ahead
i know youre off duty but weve got visitors
i can see that
are you up for a little repair work
sir
meet me at docking port two
on my way
anything serious
they said they were having trouble with one of their life support systems
whos they
retellian cargo pilots the seal is secure
welcome aboard
gracious of you to help us captain we were beginning to think our distress call would never be answered
this is subcommander tpol and my chief engineer commander tucker
our salvation
the captain said something about life support
we were hired to return a young woman to her home world a few days ago her stasis pod began to malfunction
stasis is she injured
no no shes a passenger but our ship is designed to haul cargo not people and its a very long journey putting her in suspended animation was our only choice
we have another five months ahead of us if she wakes up there wont be enough food air to breathe if were forced to abort the mission we wont get paid
commander tucker is resourceful im sure hell be able to assist you
mind if i have a look
please
youve been very accommodating if its not too much trouble id like to make another request its been a long time since weve enjoyed the luxury of a bath
i understand tpol will show you to guest quarters when youre done ill have my chef prepare you a meal
this regulates power flow to the biopod
looks very creative
these relays are from an old ardanan shuttle they werent designed to carry this much current
ive got some eps conduits that might do the trick
this would be a lot easier if i could read your language if you dont mind id like to ask our communications officer to give me a hand
by all means
is there a problem
no no no problem im going to need some tools from enterprise with a little luck sleeping beauty here will never know there was a problem
come in
i hope i didnt deplete your water supply
im sure well manage please  tpol tells me your vessel cant do much better than warp two
warp two point two
ive been making some calculations if im not mistaken at warp four point five enterprise can have you at your destination in less than four days
thats a generous offer but ive already inconvenienced you far too much
its no inconvenience were out here to meet new people youre heading toward an inhabited world weve never seen first contacts tend to go more smoothly when a familiar face is making the introductions
im sure youll do fine on your own
you could dock in our launch bay you wouldnt have to worry about that stasis pod we have plenty of room for you and your passenger
its not that simple captain this has all been carefully prearranged her familys not expecting her for another five months theyre not even on her home world at the moment but i will accept your offer of a meal if its not too late
commander hello
is that the translation
give or take an adverb
thanks
at least you dont have to work alone
hell of a way to travel isnt it
who is she any idea
i asked plinn but he doesnt seem to know too much about her he said something about studying medicine in a research colony
a doctor
i suppose so she must have a real passion for it if shes willing to go through all this shame well never get to meet her
its not polite to stare commander
whats that supposed to mean
let me know if you have any problems with that translation
i wasnt staring
hoshi
are you all right
problem
the stasis pod
what about it
its malfunctioning if youll excuse me captain
ill show you to the docking port
i know the way
what are you doing
help me open this thing
we cant bring her out of stasis
shes suffocating
the release is jammed dont bother
im sorry about this but the o2 recycler went offline
dulsha tot
youre going to be all right
kosh vos
yes
theres a minor problem im going to need your assistance
what kind of problem
the malfunction is more complicated than i expected
ill be there in a moment i dont mean to be rude
not at all archer to commander tucker trip can you hear me  archer to lieutenant reed
mister plinn
thats right
lieutenant reed the captain asked me to escort you back to your ship
that wont be necessary
im afraid im under orders
have i done something wrong
its just a precaution
i never realised leaving the captains table would cause so much concern
hes trying to break loose
secure the docking clamps
report
he hasnt gotten far at warp two sir
hail him
no response
phase cannons target his engines
direct hit to the port nacelle hes dropping out of warp
bring us into grappling range hail him again
captain
tpol
dilithium hydroxls ionised pyrosulfates
hes moving off
stay with him
i thought you took out one of his nacelles
so did i
our warp drive wont engage
that cloud he released it got into the plasma vents theyll have to be purged
hes moving out of sensor range ive lost him
tuvat at
what the hell did you do that for
tuvat at
hold on hold on im not working with them
luvasta eeva destas
calm down im not going to hurt you im im from a starship called enterprise enterprise now put that thing down and ill untie you your hands ill free your hands let me help you
has trava dukla
what the hells going on
is it repaired
what
the stasis pod
wheres captain archer
your ship is a long way from here
slovasa toraya
repair the pod so we can put her back in stasis
its going to take a few hours
work quickly
am sotey
youre welcome
tule bas
have you seen a little device its about this big has a keypad on it its my universal translator itll help us understand each other
has nos
thats it its just so we can talk
i need you to say something you got to keep talking
votni vay atayun ponas
a little more
akasa jorat foraya nuratay fegasa ana ahanjura
can you understand me
serotta jho
wheres hoshi when you need her
who is hoshi
thats better would you mind telling me whats going on here
how long have i been in stasis
youd have to ask them
commander tucker to enterprise enterprise do you hear me
you are an officer
chief engineer feels like weve gone to warp
explain yourself what do you know about my abductors
we thought they were cargo pilots they claimed you were their passenger
i am their prisoner i was returning from a diplomatic mission when they attacked my transport murdered my guards you dont know who i am do you
should i
my family is known on hundreds of worlds
well im afraid earth isnt one of them so i take it youre not a doctor
i am first monarch of the sovereign dynasty of krios prime
oh charles tucker the third please to meet you so what do these guys want
ransom no doubt theyll demand a high price for my safe return
listen my captainll be looking for me all we have to do is get off this ship and let him know where we are
and how do you propose we do that
i saw a shuttlebay earlier there were a couple of escape pods
youre not going anywhere
i beg your pardon
well remain here until they contact the sovereign guard once the ransom has been paid well be released
well if its all the same to you id rather take my chances in open space
its too dangerous if you leave it would provoke them
if i remember right this access tube leads to a junction near the shuttlebay
you are not to leave this chamber
with all due respect im not one of your subjects
hes your partner you must have some idea where hes going
obviously im his victim as well why else would he leave me here
where were you taking your passenger
goff had the coordinates
you dont even know what system you were heading for
it wasnt my responsibility he was piloting the ship not me i spent most of my time looking after the cargo believe me captain im as eager to find my partner as you are
if thats true then we could work together to track him down
i dont see how
weve got pretty good long range sensors but your ship could be anywhere within a half dozen light years itd be a lot easier if we knew your warp frequency
well im afraid i cant help you with that i know very little about warp engines
take him back to docking port two put him in the airlock and post a security detail
im telling you the truth
well keep the outer hatch unlocked if you decide to leave you know the way out
could you hand me that circuit probe the one with the green handle
you must be one hell of a diplomat
is your entire species so illmannered
no just me
you know if you were thinking rationally youd be repairing that stasis pod he did threaten to kill you
thats precisely why im getting out of here i really doubt theyre going to keep me around once i fix their problem you know i realise someone in your position isnt used to taking advice from a guy like me but i strongly suggest you come along
hed never harm me im too valuable to them
ive been involved in a few hostage situations they rarely turn out the way you expect
youre correct mister tucker i dont take advice from people like you
you know that stasis pod wont fix itself chances are youre going to spend the next five months tied up in this grimy little cargo hold not exactly my idea of a royal voyage
ill be fine
when i get back to enterprise ill make sure we get a message to your homeworld krios
krios prime
take care
once you launch an escape pod what makes you think they wont destroy it
im going to reroute their internal sensors ill be a million kilometres away before they know im gone im much better company
how much farther
just a few more metres
are you sure this is the right direction
keep your voice down what am i supposed to call you anyway first monarch your highness
kaitaama
what is that some kind of a title
its my name
what are you doing
these lead to internal sensors
we dont have all day
this is meant for one person
well have to make do unless you know how to fly one of these things
what was that
were crossing the subspace threshold
that wasnt so bad
what do you propose we do next
to be honest i hadnt really thought about it
i assumed you had a plan
i was only joking they do have a sense of humour where you come from
among the commoners only joking
its only a matter of time before they realise were gone no doubt theyll come about and look for us we need a place to hide
where
if im translating this right theres a system about ninety million kilometres from here we should be able to reach it in a day or so
what makes you think any of those planets are habitable
only one way to find out permission to set a course your sovereignty
proceed
look this would be a whole lot easier if youd stop moving around
youre touching me
im afraid i dont have much choice
its inappropriate to touch the first monarch
youre welcome to step outside until im done excuse me
there we go landing thrusters no wait theyre stabilisers
you have no idea how to control this vehicle
im working on it
even if we do find a breathable atmosphere and you manage to land without killing us what will we do about food water there could be hostile lifeforms on the surface how will we protect ourselves
look ive got less than twenty four hours to figure out how to scan a star system and programme a descent sequence in a language i dont understand and im not going to get it done with you interrupting me every five seconds so id appreciate it if youd keep quiet until im finished now lift your butt
my what
your behind your rear end i havent checked that panel yet
quickly
you know you were a lot more pleasant in stasis
i think i found the landing thrusters i understand how difficult this must be for someone of your upbringing but we could be stuck out here for awhile we should find a way to get along im willing to give it a try if you are
my hand youre sitting on my hand ill try
the prisoner sir as ordered
thank you
will there be anything else captain
not right now lieutenant dismissed
have a seat
why have i been brought here
sit down
i already told you everything i know
were not here to talk about your partner were here to talk about you
what about me
youre facing some very serious charges mister plinn where we come from criminals are held accountable for their actions if theyre found guilty theyre punished this is where your tribunal is going to take place
tribunal
i am not subject to your laws
thats not for me to decide
starfleet asked the vulcan high command to assign a judicial administrator to enterprise someone who wouldnt be swayed by human emotion someone objective logical from what i understand subcommander tpol has already reviewed the evidence this tribunal is nothing more than a formality i thought you should be prepared her punishments can be severe
how severe
if youre late for your shift you might receive a beating but for more grievous offenses dereliction of duty conduct unbecoming an officer we started out with eighty three crewmen on board were down to seventy six
but i havent done anything wrong
accessory to kidnapping resisting arrest obstruction of an investigation causing damage to a starfleet vessel
what damage
when your partner fled he released a cloud of dilithium hydroxls that clogged our plasma vents
i had nothing to do with that
as i said im not the one you have to convince
subcommander
has the accused been informed of the charges
yes maam
how much do you weigh
what
your weight
seventy two kilograms
height
one point eight metres why are you asking these questions
does your culture observe any postmortem rituals
this is not fair i demand to speak with someone from my government
hes got a point weve never tried an alien before maybe we should contact the high command
theyve granted me complete autonomy in these matters if i had to consult my superiors every time i made a ruling it would defeat my purpose here well convene at eighteen hundred hours
as you wish
you cant allow this
theres nothing i can do
but youre the captain
she owes me a few favours i cant promise anything but i id be willing to ask for leniency of course id want something in return we still havent found a way to locate your vessel if you could remember that warp frequency
are there any provisions im hungry
you might check that storage compartment above your head
you do it
im busy
if you find any water up there i could use some
thanks
allow me
im not contagious
is it edible
depends how hungry you are
it reminds me of my first car
car
a fourwheeled vehicle wasnt much bigger than this all were missing is the ocean breeze coming off the gulf i used to drive out to a place called chatkin point park along the shoreline and stare at the moon with my girlfriend dont worry i wont make a pass at you
the sovereign guard would cut off one of your hands
you must be a fun date
the first monarch doesnt socialise with the opposite sex
youve never been on a date
four years ago before i was selected to ascend to first monarch i was courted by young men from many noble families now i spend my personal time in the company of my fathers advisors
sounds kind of lonely
you havent finished your work
its all water
theres a chain of islands near the equator
will we be able to breathe
oxygen nitrogen a trace of methane nothing we cant handle
do you detect any lifeforms
if i could figure out how to use the biosensors
are you certain we have the correct planet
its the only one with an atmosphere
you may begin our descent
lets hope i get this right  were entering the thermosphere the port stabilisers down
can you repair it
no but the starboard one should keep us on course
mister tucker
so far so good eight thousand metres i think theyre metres seven thousand im pretty sure the braking thrusters are firing five thousand metres you might want to grab hold of something
two thousand metres one thousand hold on
you all right
what is that
damned if i know
this heat is unbearable
its nothing compared to a summer in the everglades at least there arent any mosquitoes
where are we going
over there looks like a good place to set up camp
your vessel will never find us here
dont underestimate captain archer
youre bleeding
its just a scratch
remove your uniform
ill take care of it later
we have no idea what microbes live in this environment it could become infected
i said later
youre my only hope of surviving here mister tucker i dont intend to let you die
this one
hold still the provisions wont last for more than a day
it sounds like theres plenty of wildlife i grew up in a place kind of like this i dont think were going to starve and i can use the thruster assembly from the pod to start a fire boil some water thanks
youre welcome
thats the best you could do
theres very little dry wood
keep looking  what are you waiting for
im not your servant youre the one who was raised in a primitive environment you find the wood
whats that supposed to mean
youre obviously better suited to physical labour
in case you havent noticed were not in a palace you said it yourself you wont survive without my help so it seems to me that im the one in charge the king of the swamp now get your ass out there and dont come back without an armful of dry wood
i should have you imprisoned for speaking to me that way
you should give me a medal youd be dead if it werent for me
im beginning to think that would be preferable
i doubt the commoners back home would complain
how dare you
youre the one who took a swing at me
you insulted the first monarch
im just a petty commoner remember raised on a primitive
whats wrong
a homing beacon unless im way off someone just locked on to it
your vessel
no way to tell
leave him
lets find his weapon
theres someone else here
trip
this a bad time
so when do you ascend
two hundred and forty six days
its a long shot but maybe enterprise will get the chance to visit krios prime before then of course from what youve told me i doubt your family would let me see you
i doubt they would but once ive been made first monarch ill have the authority to change the rules
what kind of changes
come visit me perhaps youll find out
theres a gorge on the southern continent five times deeper than the grand canyon
what have you got in mind
how about a little river rafting tpol says it only gets dark four days a month because of the binary suns well have plenty of daylight left after were done working every night
its going to take at least a week to complete the survey should be enough time to sneak in some r and r
bridge to captain archer
go ahead
weve got an alien vessel approaching theyre hailing us
put them through to shuttlepod one
yes sir
new planet new aliens banner day
were very relieved to see you im rellus tagrim this is my crew
captain archer of the starship enterprise something we can do for you
considering the circumstances we would like permission to come aboard as soon as possible
what circumstances
the neutronic wavefront its almost here
nothing on sensors
you should detect the storm in a few minutes its travelling at high warp once were aboard i suggest you go to warp seven immediately
our top speed is warp five
the wavefront spans more than half a dozen light years a vulcan starship encountered a class five over a century ago the vessel was nearly destroyed
how long until it hits
approximately four hours
if we reinforce structural integrity we should be able to weather it without too much trouble
enterprise may survive the crew is another matter the storm is saturated with radiolytic isotopes if the crew is exposed theyll be dead within three minutes sickbay is the most heavily shielded section its possible that some of the crew could survive there
we cant fit eighty three people into sickbay and im not about to draw lots
what about the catwalk you know the maintenance shaft running the length of each nacelle
they are heavily shielded some kind of osmium alloy if i remember
youre proposing we take refuge in a crawlspace
itll be a tight squeeze but theres no reason we cant fit eighty three people in there and whatever supplies we need
doctor
do you know the absorption depth of this alloy
at least twenty thousand particles per micron
it should be adequate
theres just one other problem it gets kind of toasty in there when the warp coils are online about three hundred degrees wed have to shut down the main reactor
i dont see that we have any choice well use the catwalk and set up a command station in one of the compartments
aye captain
maybe we should open a window
you think its stuffy now wait till we get eighty three people in here
and dont forget porthos and all the doctors animals
you ever been through a storm as bad as this
ran into a class three once had to take shelter in the ships core we were down there for six weeks
six weeks
any idea about a latrine
oh i never thought about that there are some storage lockers in the aft compartment we ought to be able to convert a couple of them
thisll be our bridge were going to have to juryrig these panels tap them into command functions
not much room for a captains chair
that storm mustve been pretty scary
we only got worried when the generators went down we lost the gravplating life support ill never forget that look in my fathers eyes he knew we were in trouble
sorry to keep you in there so long please
we understand
my science officer tells me youre from the takret system thats a long way from here
our work often takes us far from home
were stellar cartographers
really once we get out of the storm maybe you can help us update our star charts
wed be pleased
this way
youre behind schedule do you need help
i understand youve allotted fifteen cubic metres for medical supplies
thats correct
that means theres only enough room for twothirds of these cages
perhaps some of your creatures could share
theyll eat each other theyre vital to my work and the health of this crew im not accustomed to making emotional appeals please dont ask me to choose between them
all right twenty cubic metres
my edosian slugs thank you
im afraid these arent first class accommodations
theyll be fine commander were grateful for your hospitality
were going to have a lot of time to get to know each other if you need anything ill be right over here
i dont know the first thing about stellar cartography
guri
what if they begin to ask questions
come in  i didnt expect it to be beautiful too bad we dont have time to run some scans
well be inside the phenomenon for nearly eight days we can run all the scans we want lieutenant reed has completed his modifications
im a little nervous about shutting down the power grid
a single neutronic surge could overload the grid and damage critical systems
i did a little research in the vulcan database that class five storm a century ago involved the starship tplana apparently they couldnt outrun the wavefront it was lost with all hands i thought you said it was nearly destroyed
i must have remembered incorrectly
bridge to commander tucker
go ahead
ready for the handoff
give me a second
standing by captain
were in the drivers seat
see you in a few minutes archer out lets close up shop
done a head count
entire crews accounted for including one quadruped would you like to try out the captains chair
maybe later wheres the comm
all hands this is the captain this catwalk is going to be our home for a while a week maybe more you may not be comfortable but youll be alive we have the best crew in the fleet and the sturdiest ship i promise you well get through this
time
one minute five seconds
polarise the hull plating
thirty seconds
travis
spatial turbulence
twenty seconds fifteen ten
all hands brace for impact
aft stabilisers arent engaging
try them again
gravshears dropping
that should be the worst of it sir at least for now
you wouldnt know who was the first vulcan ambassador to earth six letters ends with an r
solkar i think
thanks captain
dont mention it
howre you holding up
pretty well sir a few days in this place should cure anyone of claustrophobia
your quarters will probably feel like a ballroom after this
youre the captain cant you order the storm to calm down a little
ill see what i can do
someone has already asked for it so why isnt he doing anything about it
how should i know
another day in this place
were running out of food
howre they doing
your guess is as good as mine one of them came out a few hours ago told us we were making too much noise now ive been real friendly even asked them to join the game doesnt seem like they want anything to do with us
lets give them a little time to adjust
you know i bet by now wed have set up camp on the rim of that canyon had a fire going
therell be other canyons
palantii are you passing through or is there something i can help you with
actually there is something
yes
i assume i can depend on doctorpatient confidentiality
this wouldnt have anything to do with gastrointestinal distress
is it that obvious
not at all theres a notation in your medical file something about an unfortunate incident during zero g training
the ev simulator at lunaport or as starfleet trainees call it the vomitorium
nothing to be embarrassed about ive treated a number of crewmen this afternoon for motion sickness
that should last for about twelve hours
thank you doctor
feeling all right malcolm
never better
any problems with the crew
oh a few bumps and bruises from the turbulence nothing too serious
i could see about moving some of this to the aft section
nonsense i have plenty of room i find the close quarters rather comforting reminds me of home
i didnt realise space was at a premium on denobula
twelve billion people sharing one continent
let me know if you change your mind
travis
weve got a cluster of plasma eddies about eighty thousand kilometres ahead i should be able to steer clear of them
wake me if theres a problem
aye captain
when were past those eddies try and get some rest yourself ensign tanner can relieve you
thank you sir good night
good night
go on go to sleep
does this bother you
only slightly
am i disturbing you
only slightly
you know theres a bright side to all of this
really
its bringing the crew closer together if you forget about the storm outside this is almost like going on a camping trip
perhaps we can sing a few songs later
havent you ever gone camping
in a manner of speaking i once participated in the kahswan ritual i was taken to the desert and left to survive for ten days
sounds fun you havent left the command area much today you might want to wander around get to know the crew
im familiar with every one of them
theres a lot more to these people than just their names itd be good for you to fraternise a little
is that an order
does it have to be
im not skilled at fraternising
heres a chance to learn
ill see your strawberry shortcake and ill raise you one pineapple cobbler
broccoli
im out of desserts
call
oh what i wouldnt give for a shower right about now when this hands over maybe you could look into building one
would you like a sauna while im at it
you knew wed be stuck in here for over a week you mightve given it a little thought to making it tolerable
i only had four hours malcolm youre lucky weve got a toilet
well i obviously overestimated your peoples abilities when it comes to indoor plumbing
you want to take a shower build one yourself
thanks chef
thanks chef
pot roast oh come on thats the third time in three days
anyone know what theyre showing tonight
the day the earth stood still
were having movie night in here
captains orders i set up a monitor in compartment five the screens a little small but
whos picking these movies shouldnt we all get a vote
i think somethings burning
are you aware youre sitting on top of a plasma manifold you got to turn that thing off
i apologise commander we shouldve spoken with you first
that mightve been a good idea
weve had trouble digesting your food
archer to tucker
go ahead
i need you in the command area right away
ill be right there
ill talk to chef maybe he can heat that up for you
we may have a problem in engineering
the antimatter injectors have come online
that cant be right probably just a glitch think youve got room for one more sleeping bag in here
not happy with your bunk mates
i caught them throwing a barbecue next to a plasma manifold now i understand were explorers were supposed to keep an open mind about different cultures but these guys are driving me crazy they only need to sleep once a week so theyve kept us up the last two nights with their strange rituals chanting walking in circles theyve practically taken over the compartment
dont forget theyre the ones who warned us about the storm we owe them be patient
im trying looks like the matter injectors and the antimatter injectors are online
two sensor glitches
a power surge couldve triggered both circuits
do you have any idea what the odds are of that happening
can you shut them down
not from here someones going to have to go to engineering
remember the suit will protect you for only twenty two minutes
itd be best not to take the scenic route
weve searched every deck theres no sign of the fugitives
what about the crew
it appears they have deserted the ship
these humans theyve travelled over a hundred light years from their homeworld
captains starlog february 9 2152 the vulcans have allowed the mazarites to leave ambassador vlar says theres a
archer and his crew mustve taken refuge in a nearby system they may intend to return whats the status of the warp engines
im having difficulty with the dilithium matrix
make it a priority
2152 weve responded to a distress call from a vessel in the
theyre immune to radiolytic isotopes the storm was never any threat to them
funny you didnt mention that
we were in danger our ship is less durable than yours we wouldve been destroyed by the storm
who are they what are they doing here
captain i assure you we dont know these men
they just happened to find enterprise in the middle of a class five neutronic storm where three members of their own species just happened to be taking refuge
were more than twenty light years from your homeworld its an unlikely coincidence
i get the feeling they must be looking for you answer me
i told you we shouldnt have come here
guri
theyre officers of the takret militia theyve been pursuing us for weeks we thought we could evade them by hiding aboard your ship
they mustve detected our vessel in your launch bay
what do they want with you
we used to be members of the militia in the lower ranks but after a year we realised that the commanding officers were corrupt they seize alien vessels without provocation they murder the crews take anything of value
theyre little more than criminals
we tried to resign our commissions but they wouldnt allow it
youre deserters
we had no choice we wouldve told you the truth but we werent sure that you would help us
if they find us well be executed
captain i apologise for the difficult position that weve put you in but i know these men even if they found us i doubt theyd simply leave theyve captured vessels far less impressive than yours
theyre trying to reinitialise the warp reactor sir it seems to me theyve already decided to help themselves to enterprise
they obviously dont realise were in the catwalk if they learn were here it would undoubtedly endanger the crew
whatre you suggesting we just sit on our hands until they fire up the engines
youre assuming these three are telling the truth theyve already lied to us
were not lying these men are dangerous
palanti to captain
yes
the dilithium matrix is active
were ready to initialise the warp reactor
stand by
do we have helm control
the navigation relays still not responding i think theyve been rerouted
how much longer
im not certain
bring the warp engines online and report to the bridge
acknowledged
we may outnumber them but we only have three ev suits
i could take a security team and bring back more
i doubt youd get very far the launch bays crawling with them
even if we could get the suits we only have twenty two minutes in the radiation hard to believe we could retake the ship in that
how long do we have
itll take a while for the warp coils to charge
how long
twenty minutes tops
remember junction forty two alpha
understood
third panel starboard side and be careful theres a lot of current running through those circuits i really ought to be the one doing this captain the doc said i was only out there for thirteen minutes
forget it trip youve already been exposed
ive isolated your comm frequencies they wont hear a thing
tell travis to wait for my signal
any progress
not yet we could lose our ship by staying here we should take what we can and leave
keep working i want helm control
ill see you back at the catwalk dont be late
aye captain
tpol
were in position
all right first youre going to have to disrupt the antimatter stream
do you see the blue conduit to the left of the power transfer module
go ahead
start by locking down the flow regulators
stand by
were being hailed
another ship
no its coming from within this vessel
answer it
youre in my chair
captain archer i didnt realise you were still aboard wheres the rest of your crew
theyre dead killed by the storm
im sorry
thanks for your condolences now why dont you get the hell off my ship
im afraid i cant do that we detected a vessel in your launch bay that belongs to three fugitives
ive been watching you i know youre trying to take enterprise im not going to let you
youre in no position to do anything about it im in command of this bridge your vessel has been impounded under the authority of the takret militia when we return youll be charged with criminal conspiracy
i dont recognise your authority i answer to starfleet command and im under orders to use any means necessary to keep my ship from falling into enemy hands
i have soldiers searching every deck its only a matter of time before they find you
youre leaving me no choice ill destroy enterprise
earths first warp five starship your fathers engine ive been reading about you captain and i doubt very much if youll do anything to damage this vessel
you would be surprised
can you trace his signal
hes somewhere on the fifth deck
you have men there alert them
go ahead
its time to change course travis head straight for that plasma eddy
itll take a minute sir
try and keep us in one piece im on my way back archer out
weve altered course
wheres he taking us
whats the problem shutting down the reactor
were having trouble with the dilithium sequencers its taking longer than we expected
i dont mean to rush you
but its getting pretty warm in here
hes steering us toward a plasma eddy
how long
less than eight minutes
get me helm control
itll take me much longer than that we should evacuate
no
you heard what he said hes willing to destroy his own ship
the temperature just went up another six degrees subcommander hows it coming
were disabling
the final sequencer
the warp reactor has shut down
spatial disturbance were four minutes from the eddy
unless youve found a way to turn this ship around i strongly suggest we abort the mission
three minutes
soldiers report to the docking hatch immediately i repeat report to the docking hatch
report
were too close to the eddy weve got to veer off
maintain your course
another one like thatll split us in two
they could still be on board
weve got no choice
maintain your course thats an order  go ahead
travis i hope youre not still heading for that eddy our friends are gone
ensign
did that guy shoot one of his own men
its hard to tell them apart in those ridiculous hats
the dead man was secretly working for sheriff boggs
how do you know that
isnt it obvious
all hands this is the captain thanks to some fine piloting by travis mayweather were going to be moving out of the storm a little earlier than expected we should be clear in a few minutes
glad you could join us subcommander we have movie night every tuesday if youre interested
i apologise for the trouble weve caused
wherere you headed next
the gyrannan system we should be safe there
good luck
thats everyone
chief engineers log supplemental this turned out to be the perfect spot to test the autopilot upgrades the gas giant has dozens of moons its like a gravitational jigsaw puzzle watch out travis these modifications are working so well pretty soon we wont need pilots anymore
archer to shuttlepod one
captain
looks like youre about to have some company trip sensors are picking up a small
say again captain im picking up a lot of interference
this is commander charles tucker
tucker to enterprise mayday im losing power mayday if you can hear me im making an emergency landing thrusters only i take it back travis i could use a flesh and blood pilot right about now
enterprise to shuttlepod one commander tucker do you read me
malcolm
i detected weapons fire and then both ships just disappeared
last known position
approximately fifty thousand kilometres bearing zero zero three mark two seven i think i cant be more specific its the damned interference
many of these moons have atmospheres that contain selenium isotopes thats most likely whats affecting our sensors
trips a good pilot if he was near one of those moons he most likely set down on it how many are there
sixty two
then wed better start looking travis
yes sir
well scan every moon even if we have to do it with binoculars keep hailing him
chief engineers log supplemental for the record i was attacked by a small craft i dont know what i did to provoke him something in this moons atmosphere neutralised my engines i was forced to make an emergency landing looks like i took some damage on impact main powers still offline i dont think ill be flying out of here first things first ill try and get the transceiver working contact the enterprise
damn it
son of a bitch stole my transceiver
who are they
an arkonian military vessel
youve dealt with them
no but im aware of their reputation if were in their territory we should proceed with extreme caution
theyre hailing us
you are on an unauthorised course leave immediately
and you are
captain khatan zshaar i have orders to destroy any vessel that violates our territory
im captain jonathan archer of the starship enterprise we werent aware that this system was claimed by anyone
why is there a vulcan on your bridge
subcommander tpol is my science officer
turn your ship around
a member of my crew is missing we believe he exchanged weapons fire with a small vessel was it one of yours
we sent a patrol ship to intercept your shuttle we have also lost contact
then maybe we can look for them together once weve recovered our crewman well be more than happy to leave
if your shuttle did encounter my patrol ship your crewman is already dead
either way were not going anywhere until we know what happened now it seems to me we have a similar problem two missing people and sixty two moons itll go a lot faster if we use both our ships to coordinate the search the sooner we get started the sooner well be out of your territory
its him i recognise his shuttlecraft he seems about as bad off as i am whatever knocked out my engines probably did the same to his if id brought a universal translator along id be able to explain to this guy that im just trying to get out of here like he is one piece of good news its starting to warm up a little dawn is coming
im coming out now please dont fire i want to talk im unarmed
we need to talk you have something that belongs to me i want it back if you understand anything that im saying to you i want you to listen very very closely mary had a little lamb its fleece was white as snow
and everywhere that mary went the lamb was sure to go
now maybe we can introduce ourselves
nice to meet you too now i dont want to hurt you i just want my transceiver back
im no good until ive had my coffee
you wouldnt have a universal translator on you
i dont understand a word youre saying
i cant make it work its broken you know broken i was trying to make repairs when you stole it
what
kushka roatta
you want me to fix your transceiver
is that a yes or a no
kushka
kushka to you too
you kill me and i cant fix anything youre going to have to untie me i need my hands
i try anything im a dead man i get the message
any progress
weve searched five of the moons no sign of commander tucker or the arkonian ship
and the arkonians
it appears theyve made no progress either theyre continuing to search the moons they agreed to
this is their territory they could have called for more ships to help search
im afraid they dont trust us primarily because im a vulcan
whats the bad blood
we made first contact nearly a hundred years ago not long after the arkonians developed warp drive but from the beginning our relations were difficult your people accepted vulcan guidance opened diplomatic and cultural exchanges the arkonians were suspicious and deceitful eventually the high command withdrew its contingent
well maybe well have better luck with them
it doesnt appear promising
they agreed to work with us
for now id advise you to remain cautious arkonians are unpredictable theyre prone to hostility
ill keep that in mind let me know when we reach the next moon
damn it
damn
well looks like weve made some headway in our first contact between humans and whatever you are unfortunately your first word is something you wouldnt want to use in polite company
damn it
no im trip  trip
trip  zhokaan
zhokaan great now that weve been properly introduced how about some water zhokaan its getting kind of hot thirsty you know drink water
trip
thanks
what the hell is that
sorry i have water in my shuttle water something i can drink
theres a medkit in my shuttlepod
what the hell are you doing are you crazy
that was quite a trick
drat drat komacha
all right all right i cant fix this thing its a lost cause maybe if you vomit on it itll fix itself come over here i want you to see this here come here its like talking to porthos see this i tried bypassing the induction coil but it didnt work see in here
i cant fix this i need to get back to my ship my ship now pick em up pick them up
same to you now lets get going
what have you got
see for yourself
ill need a little help here
its a thermokinetic analysis of e moons each of them undergoes extreme temperature variations during their orbits
go on
at night it can drop to five or even ten degrees below zero
doesnt sound so bad
during the day the temperature can rise to as high as one hundred and seventy degrees
wed better hope that trip landed on the night side
and that we find him before the sun rises
dont give me that look you started this
you want some food food
nohkto
nohkto i couldnt agree more
you want food from your ship vdhoze that means food
vdhoze
vdhoze ship
ship
yeah sorry but breakfast is going to have to wait ive figured out a way to get us out of here i got a pretty good look at your comm configuration back there i think i can cannibalise the power supply from your transceiver and use it to get mine working maybe get a message off
got it almost there i think this is going to work
nohkto
no not nohkto good
good
thats right were getting out of here once we get back to enterprise and we can finally understand each other the first words out of your mouth had better be thank you
you think thats funny
you going to laugh now tucker to enterprise enterprise do you read me come on hoshi tucker to enterprise this terrain its all volcanic igneous rock is heavy in diamagnetic minerals its interfering with the transmission i think i know what we need to do the transceiver the tsunsana its bad down here nohkto but if we take it to higher ground we could avoid some of the interference im going to need help you and me together
see im not going to hurt you and you are not going to hurt me well work together
before we start well get some food from your ship your vdhoze
easy
is that the best you can do
we can fight some more if you want or we can try to get the hell out of here whats it going to be
come on
captain im picking up a transmission
trip
i cant tell yet im trying to get a lock
respond mayday enterprise anybody please respond
we never received a call
it was transmitted on a starfleet frequency
you told me these moons are dangerous so why havent you rescued your pilot
thats why i asked you here the message was in a starfleet frequency but we think the carrier wave was generated by your technology we werent able to respond if we cant isolate the wave we wont be able to rescue either of them my science officer believes she can recalibrate your scanners to isolate our frequencies then you can pinpoint their location
if i allowed a vulcan access to an arkonian ship id be executed
then send your science officer over here tpol can show him what to do it seems my engineer and your pilot have found a way to work together
chief engineers log supplemental its been two hours since we started signaling the enterprise no response yet the suns not even up yet and its already hotter than hell my sparring partner doesnt look too good i cant be sure but i dont think his species can sweat for the record i have learned one thing about him his names zhokaan anything you want to say to the folks back home
nohkto
that means bad youd be proud of me hoshi ive picked up about a dozen words in his language a couple of them are real tonguetwisters
hey zhokaan  i though i lost you there
tsunsana enterprise krnat
no no enterprise
damn it
dont worry ill get phlox to cook up a new batch for you once were aboard enterprise hes great with that kind of thing stay with me zhokaan gan tak dont die on me now understand all right
enterprise
see i told you hoshi is that you
do you read me
we read you trip
youre just in time captain its starting to get a little hot down here
were getting a lock on your position now
dont send a shuttlepod
theres something in this atmosphere thatll affect the engines
its selenium isotopes but we dont think it will interfere with the transporter
im not alone captain
we know the arkonians helped us find you how are you and their pilot getting along
uh just like old friends im a little worried though hes gotten very dehydrated
stand by trip  prepare the transporter
i wouldnt do that captain
whats the problem
ive been analysing the arkonians physiology their endocrine system is extremely sensitive to temperature fluctuations if that pilot is suffering from dehydration its no doubt causing an acute cellular breakdown
meaning
transporting him will most likely be fatal
archer to commander tucker
im still here captain
trip we can bring you aboard but we cant transport the arkonian doctor phlox says it will kill him well try to find a way to get him back to his ship
but in the meantime im getting you out of there
no way captain im not leaving him here
the surface temperature is rising quickly commander i estimate it will reach one hundred thirty degrees within the next hour
lets get you home
then well worry about your friend
im sorry sir but i cant do that
maybe theres another way
we know our pods cant make it but i got a good look at the circuitry inside the arkonian shuttle one of theirs could be modified
how
if they take a look at their intake manifolds
i think they could realign them to filter out the isotopes
well talk to them but i wont let you stay down there much longer
understood
archer out
tucker to enterprise enterprise respond some of these relays have fused must be the heat hey gan tak
i dont suppose the captainll trust me to go out on my own for a while i wouldnt be surprised if he knocked me down to steward your orange juice sir jam or marmalade sir but i tell you i wouldnt trade my time on enterprise not for anything ive seen things i could never imagine back home i saw the great plume of agosoria and i saw the ringed moons of matalas prime and i stood on an asteroid crater twice as high as everest and went diving in the ice caves of etheenia rode in a suliban cell ship spent the night i spent the night with a princess oh and i even got pregnant once now theres a story im sure you have stories too thats why we chose this life right see things weve never seen before hell of a ride though hell of a ride
zhokaan vdhoze
come in
i just got a report from my doctor your pilots responding well hell be ready to go home in a few hours
and your crewman
hes tired and a bit sunburned but hes doing fine
if i discover that my pilot fired on your shuttle without provocation hell be disciplined
it was a misunderstanding i hope we can avoid them in the future
i expect you to leave this system immediately as agreed
i guess we wont be adding the arkonians to our list of friends
the encounter was less volatile than i expected you managed to establish better relations in a single day than the vulcans have in a century
lets hope it stays that way
hows he doing
why dont you ask him yourself the universal translator is online
they told me another ten minutes of sunshine and wed have been cooked
tarattaash
i thought you said the ut was working
i believe you promised me some tarattaash
you mean the brown stuff you were drinking wont take a minute anything else while im at it our chef is making something called chicken marsala tonight
tarat
tarattaash got you
trip when i fired at your vessel im grateful i didnt destroy it
that makes two of us
your neurolytic enzymes are considerably higher than last month
the treatments no longer effective
i told you it was just a matter of time before wed need supplemental medications this conference is a perfect opportunity some of your finest physicians will be there its essential that i speak with them
its too great a risk id be taken off enterprise
i think i can question them without revealing that youre infected
its too great a risk
im afraid we have no choice without further treatment you could very possibly die
how longs it been doc
oh i havent seen feezal for nearly four years
whats the point of having three wives if you never get to see them
denobulans are renowned for their patience
welcome my beloved
my beloved
captain archer id like you to meet my second wife feezal
its a pleasure to have you aboard
thank you
and this is our chief engineer commander tucker
maam
i look forward to helping you install the microscope
we can hold that off till later im sure the two of you are eager to spend some time together
nonsense captain weve been apart for four years another hour another day as i said were very patient
well in that case why dont we have some lunch while the microscopes being unloaded
id be honoured
wont you be joining us commander
id love to but i think i should make sure your equipment gets up to sickbay in one piece
then ill see you after lunch
you bet
it seems odd doesnt it that a denobulan physician would be interested in a vulcan disease
one of my colleagues on denobula has been studying panar syndrome for some time its pathology is quite similar to thymic sclerosis
thymic sclerosis
its a nonfatal illness which weve had very little success treating i promised him my colleague back home that id inquire about any recent advances in its treatment
were hesitant to discuss panar syndrome doctor this illness is unique to a subculture a small percentage of our population their behaviour is neither tolerated nor sanctioned
my friend is well aware of that unfortunately thymic sclerosis is found in all strata of denobulan society developing a cure is of paramount importance
do you have any literature on this disease
as i told you im currently serving on a starfleet vessel humans are not susceptible to it i could contact my colleague but it would take at least five days before wed receive a response
im afraid well have returned to vulcan by then
anything you could provide me with would be instrumental in helping the denobulan people
well have to discuss your request doctor when weve reached a decision well contact you aboard your ship
thank you for your time
if the reflectometer is supposed to amplify the neutron stream shouldnt it be installed before the emitters
its collimating the neutrons not amplifying them if you read the instructions youll find its all very clear
oh ive tried to read the instructions and they are anything but clear i dont want to brag but i can take apart and put back together just about any piece of equipment ive ever met its one of the reasons captain archer picked me for this mission because im really good at following instructions but these are in
denobulan i understand thats why im here so lets go through it slowly do you see the threads on the aperture ring
here
exactly take the smaller condenser lens and screw it on now remodulate the emitter frequency thatll initiate the neutron stream
which one
youre going to have to help me with this one
its very simple insert the thick end into this opening itll automatically programme the frequency you can pull it out now the stream should be initiated
i think im getting the hang of it maybe if you explain the next few steps i could try and get through some of this on my own
by all means youre a very confident young man arent you
i try to be
youre going to need to come a little closer to see this
have you spoken to phlox since he got back
i wasnt aware he was gone
you mustve not seen him yesterday morning he was champing at the bit to get down to that conference brought back a wish list of medical instruments
it is the first ime conference hes attended in over a year
he said there was a vulcan contingent you might want to go down for a visit you may know one of them
there are over one million physicians on vulcan
i would think youd enjoy spending time with members of your own species  archer
a vulcan transport has requested permission to dock sir theyve already left the surface
speak of the devil looks like you wont have to go anywhere ill meet them at docking port two
theyve asked that the doctor join you and subcommander tpol
let him know okay
right away sir
you have any idea what this is about
i havent spoken to anyone on the surface
you can bet theyre not coming up for coffee and doughnuts
can i get you something thanks to subcommander tpol our chef has learned to make some pretty decent plomeek soup
we appreciate your hospitality captain but weve come to speak to your doctor with your permission
absolutely if you need anything just let me know
we would appreciate it if tpol would remain
subcommander
weve discussed your request unfortunately we are still hesitant to share data regarding panar syndrome
subcommander tpol is not aware of my request im curious why you asked her to stay
youre requesting information about a vulcan disease and you didnt discuss it with your vulcan science officer
thats correct as far as i know her expertise does not include medicine
are you familiar with panar syndrome subcommander
of course
would you mind describing it
you are physicians why would you need me to define an illness
please indulge us
its an incurable degradation of the synaptic pathways it also affects the endocrine and immune systems
an impressive definition could you tell us how the disease is transmitted
through a telepathic practice
and what practice would that be
mindmelds they cause a disruption of neuroelectric impulses in the midbrain which can lead to the early stages of the syndrome
do you condone these acts subcommander these mindmelds
id appreciate it if youd tell me why you asked me here
as would i your questions to tpol seem inappropriate
doctor phlox has asked for data regarding the treatment of panar syndrome did you have anything to do with that request
i believe i was very clear about that
yes your colleague on denobula forgive us doctor but since theres a vulcan serving on your ship a fact that you neglected to mention to us we had to consider other possible motives for you inquiry
what motive are you suggesting
are you familiar with any of these names
theyre vulcan im not familiar with any of them
theyre melders vulcans with the ability to transfer thoughts and memories to each other do you know any melders subcommander
not well but ive met a number of them
then ill ask you again do you condone their behaviour
i dont understand what your questions have to do with the doctors request
we find their behaviour unacceptable and since panar syndrome is transmitted by these people its cure is not a priority
are you saying there is no additional research
none that wed care to disseminate im sorry
you travelled up from the surface to tell doctor phlox you wouldnt help him
if youll please show us to the airlock
is it definitive
unmistakably shes suffering from the syndrome
now watch a simple strand of protein molecules can be enlarged and enhanced to where we can clearly see a single nucleotide
amazing look at that are those
carbon atoms now you try it
first i reinitialise the neutron stream
precisely very good now align the quantum filters
this is a bitch
excuse me
oh not you the microscope
has vesna forgiven groznik yet
absolutely not groznik has only apologised twice i doubt hell be forgiven for another two years
well at least he has his other wives
not wives wife kessil moved to teerza prime to be with her third husband
did i do this right why is there no image
you forgot to enter the frequency parameters
which one was her third husband oh was that klaban
bogga klaban was forlisas husband her first i think
there you go why isnt it sharp
you forgot to stabilise the aperture thats just a reflection of the imaging filament thats all right
well reinitialise the neutron stream and start again
forlisa forlisa oh my my
i thought about asking forlisa to be my second wife turned out she already had three husbands
archer to doctor phlox
yes captain
could you report to my ready room
certainly ill be back as soon as i can my beloved commander
come in
yes captain
i wanted to see both of you its been a while since i was embarrassed by a vulcan dignitary
sir
i just spoke to doctor oratt it seems you requested some medical data regarding a vulcan illness for a colleague on denobula
yes sir
and both of you said that tpol had nothing to do with that request are you both going to lie to me like you lied to them
i have no intention of lying to you captain
and when were you going to tell me that youve contracted a serious illness
sir
they handed you something a padd i think does that ring a bell you left a fingerprint it was enough for them to run tests why did you lie to them
its none of their concern
it sure as hell is if they can help you  how long have you known about this
nearly a year
and you never thought that maybe you should come to me and let me know that one of my officers has a potentially fatal disease
i believe your culture embraces the concept of doctorpatient confidentiality
the disease is not contagious if we had told you theres nothing you could have done
you still havent explained to me why you lied to the vulcans and why would you think they would be more apt to help you if you said it was for a denobulan colleague
panar syndrome is an illness that carries a stigma on vulcan
if the high command was to learn that i was infected i would most likely lose my commission
for having a disease
its not about the disease its about the people who are capable of transmitting it
go on
there are certain vulcans a small minority who are born with the ability to perform a very intimate form of telepathy
intimate
a melding of minds
that ship of vulcans who were experimenting with emotions
they are part of the telepathic minority one of the reasons why they left vulcan was to escape prejudice their behaviour is considered unnatural theyre seen as a threat
you belong to that minority
no
then
only members of the minority can initiate a mindmeld but any vulcan can be the recipient
why would you take that risk
it wasnt by choice one of the men on that ship
you were attacked i remember im sure the high command will understand
i have no intention of telling them
why not
i have my reasons
how serious is it
ive kept it in check but the symptoms have progressed thats why i requested the most current research
well your request was accompanied by a lie and whatever your reasons might have been youre no longer welcome at the conference the vulcans have seen to that
i understand
my number one priority here is the health of my first officer if these doctors have data that can help her i plan to get it
im sorry did we keep you waiting
actually you did
what can we do for you captain
subcommander tpol and my doctor have explained the situation to me
its unfortunate that tpol is ill
doctor phlox assures me that he was only trying to protect her privacy he doesnt make a habit of lying
i certainly hope not
im having a little difficulty understanding why you wont share your research especially now that you know it could help tpols condition i cant believe youre withholding it to punish doctor phlox
our decision has nothing to do with that
then what does it have to do with
panar syndrome is a disease thats unique to an undesirable segment of our population thankfully there are very few of them
and because you find them undesirable theyre not entitled to medical care
we dont condone the intimate acts that these people engage in they defy everything our society stands for
intimate acts youre talking about mindmelds
we take great pride in our ability to contain emotions sharing them is offensive now if youll excuse me we have a great deal of work to do before the conference ends
if youre not going to help her the least you could do is show a little discretion the high command doesnt need to know about this
its not for us to decide what the high command needs to know
you have her genetic profile you must realise shes not a member of this minority
nonetheless theres only one way to contract panar syndrome good day
yes
theres a message for you coming from the surface
transfer it here
right away
come in
i was just about to call you sit down im sorry i didnt have much luck down there they seemed pretty pigheaded when it comes to panar syndrome and i got the distinct feeling theyre not going to keep this to themselves
i just received a message from doctor yuris
which one was he
the youngest he asked me to meet him in a northern section of the city i believe he wants to help
help that seems like the last thing these doctors want to do
he asked me to come alone
you know it never dawned on me that it was contagious
i beg your pardon
you said it wasnt contagious that there was nothing i could have done
thats correct
that doesnt mean you shouldnt have told me
theres a landing port about a kilometre south of the meeting place you worry about your crew
youre damn straight i do every last one of them you find that strange i guess all vulcans find worrying strange
i didnt want you to worry about me
subcommander this may be of use to you
what is it
the research your doctor asked for
youve taken a great risk by bringing this to me
one that im more than willing to take
why
theres more intolerance today than there was a thousand years ago it has to stop
why jeopardise your career to help someone you despise
if i despised you id be despising myself im part of the minority
you know im not a member of the minority
as far as my colleagues are concerned you might as well be anyone who chooses to perform a mindmeld is worthy of contempt
what if i didnt choose
you were coerced you should tell them theyll be far more sympathetic
are you infected
no only a small percentage are if they ask my opinion i wont be able to condone what you did i hope you understand
you cant jeopardise your position
i have to return tell them what happened tell them before they contact the high command
thank you for this
it doesnt make any sense
why not
were orbiting an alien world and most of the crew are free to go down and visit why would anyone want to stay on board and watch a movie
are you kidding theyre showing the black cat boris karloff and bela lugosi
it sounds like youre the one picking the movies
me
who else would choose an obscure horror film why not something a little more i dont know romantic im going down to the surface
whats the rush you havent even finished your dinner
theres a shuttle leaving at eighteen hundred hours
youve got plenty of time
try the cobbler chef outdid himself
okay but i have to leave in a few minutes
may i join you
please im hoshi sato ive been meaning to introduce myself
feezal phlox youre the language wizard my husband speaks very fondly of you
doctor phlox has been teaching me denobulan
im impressed
im still having trouble with the transitive verbs
im getting a little paranoid here youre not talking about me are you
matter of fact we were
ensign sato barely has an accent she was telling me how attractive she thinks you are
shes pulling your leg sir i was only talking about grammar
its okay hoshi
ive got to go it was very nice to meet you
i wasnt exactly pulling your leg was i
no not exactly look im very flattered but arent you a married woman
im a woman thats all that matters isnt it
im afraid ive got to go too captain asked me to write a synopsis of tonights movie
save me a seat
you probably wouldnt like it its very scary and youve got to youve got to be human to appreciate horror films ill see you in the morning
shes at it again
i dont know about you but i find her quite attractive
come on malcolm this is serious what if phlox finds out
you havent done anything to make her think that you
of course not maybe i should tell the doc
tell him what that his wife is trying to seduce you not a good idea
ive got to spend the next two days with her working on the microscope i really think i should speak to phlox
it might be a lot easier to avoid her advances than to get phlox angry i once saw him lose his temper when one of his creatures bit him it wasnt a pretty sight
this is far from a cure but it should slow down the progression of the disease its surprising i assumed your science directorate wouldve made more progress than this
as weve seen theyre not very motivated to develop a cure
with this research i should be able to get closer than they have
how useful is it
very it will allow me to improve my course of treatment long before her symptoms get worse
have you figured out why doctor yuris gave it to you
no i havent you spoke with them
a few minutes ago theyve decided to recall you
do they have the authority to do that
doctor oratt does hes a ranking member of the council of physicians they plan on taking you back to vulcan when the conference is over
have they notified the high command
not till you reach vulcan youve got to tell them tpol tell them what happened they wont do a thing to you once they know it wasnt voluntary that he did it against your will
i wont do that
why the hell not
i have panar syndrome it doesnt make a difference how i contracted it
it makes a lot of difference youre not a member of this minority he forced himself on you you said it yourself
hes right tpol you should tell them
he is not right if i use that as a defence as a way to keep from being taken off enterprise id be condoning their prejudice and in the process indicting every member of the minority i wont do that
wheres oratt
doctor oratt isnt available perhaps i can help you
perhaps you cant
youre going to have to leave
i need to talk to you
i told him you were busy
what can i do for you captain
you have no right to take my science officer
youre mistaken i have every right
you cant dismiss someone just because you dont agree with the way they conduct their personal lives
i am not dismissing tpol im simply returning her to vulcan the high command will decide whether she is fit for duty
fit youre saying a single mindmeld is enough to destroy her career or is it that she contracted the disease thats why youre so hesitant to find a cure isnt it why bother to help people you dont approve of
im sorry you dont understand the complexities of our culture captain please have the subcommander ready to depart in thirty six hours
not so fast you know what this is doctor my communications officer got it from the vulcan database its the protocols of the council of physicians it says that anyone accused of ethical misconduct is entitled to a hearing before the ranking medical officer in the province or territory where the accusation was first made if im not mistaken that would be you
the accusation against tpol stands its not open for debate
where i come from everythings open for debate and if i read these protocols correctly so is the accusation you made against my science officer
youre wasting your time
its mine to waste
very well but i will not delay our departure the hearing will take place tomorrow afternoon
tomorrow afternoon fine
its the dekendis favourite sport
just because they asked you to participate doesnt mean you had to
they said it was an honour it looked easy enough
youre lucky this creature didnt strike a bit lower if i may ask what is the purpose of this sport
theyve got these fargans theyre kind of like cows with humps and they love melons i think theyre melons so four guys get into this big circle filled with fargans and they throw these melons back and forth they use sticks with metal baskets at the end do you play monkeyinthemiddle on denobula
i dont believe so
anyway after a while the fargans start figuring out whats going on and
you got a minute doc
are you not feeling well commander
no im fine i just er i need to talk to you for a minute
by all means whats on your mind
actually i was kind of hoping to talk to you alone
i think were about done here it would be best if you avoided fargans for a few days
thanks doc commander
see you travis malcolm said this was a bad idea but i i think its the right thing to do
whats that
feezal i mean mrs phlox is a lovely woman and shes very smart she knows more about quantum optics than anyone ive ever met
she is remarkable
remarkable yeah she sure is
was there something else
yeah there is you got to understand ive been a perfect gentleman absolutely nothings happened shes trying to shes shes er making advances if you know what i mean
sexual advances
im afraid so
has she offered to give you a rose petal bath
no no no nothing like that
oh any man would be a fool to ignore the romantic overtures of a healthy denobulan woman dont you find her attractive
sure i mean no shes your wife
what does that have to do with it
shes your wife
oh nonsense nonsense youre too concerned with human morality i thought you wanted to learn about new cultures isnt that why you joined starfleet
why of course it is but i was brought up believing you dont play around with another mans wife i dont think im ever going to change my mind about that
as you wish your loss
come in
lieutenant reed told me you went to the surface
i spoke to doctor oratt i didnt tell you because i didnt want you to try and talk me out of it
i assume you were unsuccessful
not exactly before i left i got the medical protocols from hoshi it seems they owe you a hearing
theyll never agree
they already did
i have no interest in challenging their decision
if youre not going to defend yourself the least you can do is speak for this minority youre so eager to protect you said you didnt want to condone the attitude of these doctors your silence would do just that
you need to understand i wont tell them how i got the disease
ill go along with that i promise but youve got to understand im not going to give you up without a fight
the fact that she has panar syndrome is not the reason shes being recalled
no it has to do with how she got infected a mind meld over a year ago
when it took place is not pertinent
so what youre saying is that if a vulcan even an officer in the science directorate engages in this exchange of thoughts and memories theyre condemned for it
as youve been told captain mind melds are practiced by a subculture vulcans who have elected to conduct themselves in an unacceptable manner
they havent elected to do anything theyre born with this ability
exactly theyre genetic aberrations who prey on people like you people foolish enough to experiment with abhorrent behaviour
you humans are too volatile too irrational too narrowminded thats what i heard for years from every vulcan i met but we dont hold a candle to you when it comes to narrowminded we got rid of bigotry nearly a century ago were not afraid of diversity we dont persecute it we embrace it if you call yourselves enlightened you have to accept people who are different than you are
this is pointless our culture is governed by rules were not about to ignore them
there are no rules telling you to oppress minorities
youd rather let them spread their infections thats exactly why youre being recalled
no im being recalled because youre afraid of anything that doesnt conform to your idea of acceptable behaviour
unfortunately you dont know what youre talking about the decisions been made we should end this inquiry
she knows exactly what shes talking about
are you questioning our judgement
there is nothing abhorrent about the way we lead our lives
we
there is no simple definition of intimacy those of us capable of mindmelds are no different than you are
you realise that you are jeopardising your reputation your career
we share our thoughts differently we shouldnt be punished for that
the high command will determine whether you should be punished both of you
shes not guilty of anything she was violated
you gave me your word
the mindmeld was performed against her will
can you verify this
why so you can perpetuate your double standard condemn the infected when they meld by choice and sympathise with them when they dont
what do you know of this captain
seems my science officer doesnt want to discuss it thats good enough for me
she told me herself she made me promise to stay silent im sorry i had to tell them the truth you should do the same
i have nothing to say to them
feezal tells me it can be quite temperamental
i think ive got it figured out just let me know when it starts acting up have you got the activation sequence down
my beloved i certainly hope its not another four years until i see you again
so do i but remember your other wives are anxious to see you too
commander tucker assures me hell keep your beautiful microscope in perfect running order
as his doctor i hope youll keep commander tucker in perfect running order perhaps thatll motivate me to visit more often
its a shame you two didnt get to know each other better
well ive got to get back to my warp engine the plasmas running a little hot
i know how it feels
pleasure meeting you
humans
come in
doctor yuris has been suspended
that was to be expected
they offered him a hearing but he refused oratt said hell lose his standing with the medical exchange when they get back to vulcan
also to be expected
one good thing did come out of this they believed him when he said you were forced youre not going to be recalled
with your permission ill be contacting the high command i dont intend to let yuris be dismissed without a fight
permission granted i know you must be very disappointed that he broke his promise to you but on a selfish note im glad he did i didnt want to lose you
maybe this incident will encourage others to speak out
lets hope so
report
the imperial guard will die at their posts but
i know my men are willing to die i want to hear their chances of surviving
were holding our positions for now but the enemy has deployed new units here and here
theyre looking for a weakness
they may have found it weve taken more casualties
ive received a communiqu� the vulcans want to discuss terms for a cease fire
have you ever known a vulcan who wouldnt lie to get what he wanted
there is another option someone ive dealt with a pinkskin hes proven to be quite evenhanded in dealing with vulcans his name is archer
youre sure he wants me
ambassador soval said your presence is crucial to resolving the crisis
whats this planet called again
the vulcan name is paan mokar the andorians call it weytahn its on the frontier between their systems both sides claim it belongs to them theyve nearly gone to war over it twice in the past century
how do they expect me to help settle a conflict they havent been able to resolve in a hundred years
soval says youll be fully briefed when you arrive jonathan this is the first time the vulcans have asked for our help youre the closest thing we have to an ambassador out there you know how important this could be
well get there as fast as we can
i dont like pushing the engines this hard the injectors are running at a hundred and ten percent
theyre rated for one hundred and twenty
and my underwear is flameretardant that doesnt mean im going to light myself on fire to prove it
i think well make it in one piece trip ive been reading about paan mokar in the vulcan database it doesnt say a lot class d not much bigger than earths moon claimed by the vulcans in 2097
class d thats uninhabitable why are you fighting over it
when the andorians first arrived a century ago they began to terraform the planet once an atmosphere was developed they established a settlement
if it was unclaimed at the time why would there be a problem
its sole value is its strategic location near vulcan space
they were setting up a military base
it was the only logical conclusion
was there any evidence
how much evidence would you need if the klingons decided to set up a colony on pluto
thats not the same thing
the andorians refused to let the high command inspect the colony so they annexed paan mokar to protect their territory
what happened to the andorian colonists
they were removed
by force
they left the high command little choice a surveillance satellite was put into orbit to monitor the agreement the planets been deserted for nearly a century
until now
unbelievable i damn near burn up the warp reactor getting here and they make us wait
welcome aboard ambassador
thank you captain this is subcommander muroc
tpol has been filling me in on the situation here but i still have a lot of questions
if you dont mind captain i have a question of my own why would an officer of the andorian imperial guard personally request your involvement
i dont understand i was told you asked for me
im involved in extremely difficult and dangerous negotiations i dont consider your presence here an asset
if thats how you feel well gladly continue with our mission
six days ago an andorian regimental commander named shran landed a force on paan mokar and occupied the settlement
shran
naturally we attempted to enforce the treaty of 2097
naturally
weve regained control of half the colony but two dozen vulcans have been wounded and three have been taken hostage
shran has agreed to discuss terms for their safe return but only if you act as mediator for some reason he finds you trustworthy
youre asking for my help
yes captain im asking for your help
ill see what i can do
forgive my candor but thats hardly reassuring the last time you dealt with the andorians a vulcan intelligence site was compromised and a priceless monastery destroyed subcommander muroc will accompany you to represent our interests
obviously im here at the request of the andorians shran believes he can trust me i dont intend to prove him wrong by going down there with a vulcan officer in tow if you insist i bring a vulcan along ill take the one i know i can trust
you wanted to see me doc
yes this planet is home to a rather pernicious mutagenic pathogen and ill need to bombard your immune system with analeptic radiation to protect you while youre on the surface
bombard
its quite painless i assure you
what about tpol
vulcan physiology isnt affected by the pathogen shall we
this should only take a moment if i may ask how did your first meeting with the vulcans go
warm and friendly as ever
ironic they werent overly enthusiastic about you taking command of enterprise in the first place and now your presence is crucial to their interests
its crucial to ours too maybe were not out here to just scan comets and meet new species maybe were out here to prove that humanity is ready to join a much larger community i intend to do that whether the vulcans like it or not
all finished
captain i served as a medic in the denobulan infantry if i learned anything from that experience its that battlefields are unpredictable places even under a flag of truce be careful
weve lost the navigational sensors and the comm
its the andorian jamming signal im entering the landing coordinates they gave us
lets hope theyre accurate
did you have a chance to read the territorial compromise
i glanced at it
the compromise is at the heart of this dispute its worth your attention
its twelve hundred pages long
did you glance at any of the other materials i sent to your quarters vlars treatise on negotiating tactics is the definitive text on the subject
i got all of it vlars treatise the revised intersystem agreement the high command briefing on the border incursions of 2112 i was up till two am
glancing
are you trying to tell me something that maybe im not prepared for this
ambassador soval clearly believes youll fail i was hoping some advance preparation would help you prove him wrong
thanks but i doubt im going to impress shran by quoting vulcan treaties
i assume you have a strategy
the first thing is to convince shran that he can trust me
and then
were just going to have to play it by ear
are you sure these are the coordinates
yes
dont move vulcan
captain
were not armed
im captain jonathan archer im here to see commander shran
hes expecting you without a vulcan escort
i wasnt told to come alone this is my science officer she helped expose the vulcan listening post at pjem i thought shran might enjoy seeing her again
i imagined my first diplomatic mission would involve sitting around a big table toasting with champagne signing things with lots of pens
the pinkskin sense of humour my apologies for the security precautions
we can never be too vigilant when it comes to vulcans
they say the same thing about you
im sure they do were aggressive illogical
prove them wrong
thats why youre here captain to help us do just that ive dealt with the vulcans twice before where you were involved both times you handled the situation without prejudice
i hope i can help again but the first thing i need is to see the hostages
hostages criminals take hostages kidnappers looking for a ransom take hostages i assume youre referring to the enemy soldiers we captured
the vulcans want to know theyre all right
they havent been harmed
are you all right
when they attacked us two of my men were badly wounded
theyre lucky we didnt kill them
you provoked this situation when you violated the territorial compromise
only a vulcan could call a hundred years of oppression a compromise you annexed a planet that belongs to us herded our people into refugee camps
after you set up a military outpost here
as you can see captain even after a hundred years this situation still evokes anger on both sides we will release our prisoners on the following conditions immediate withdrawal of all vulcan military forces the socalled compromise is to be rescinded and the vulcans must concede irrevocable sovereignty of weytahn to andoria
you dont expect them to agree to all that
i told you hes a puppet of the vulcans
for the record the vulcan high command doesnt like me very much and frankly the feeling is mutual if all you need is someone to deliver your list of demands find somebody else ive got other things to do
the vulcans always say theyre ready to talk but it amounts to nothing treaty negotiations that drag on for years i want to speak to soval somebody who can deal with the situation without having to check with his superiors
ill see what i can do
here on my terms
that might be a little difficult
this is pointless
but not impossible the thing is hes going to want something in return
havent they already taken enough
im talking about a gesture something to show youre serious i came down here to see about the hostages why dont you let them go
and give away our only advantage
no
release two of them then keep the other one until after youve met with soval
one as a show of our good faith
youre being awfully quiet
is there something youd like to discuss
you dont seem too happy with the way i handled things down there
as shran said this is a provocative issue however i think you did well
thank you
but my opinion often differs from the high commands
unacceptable
you got one of your men back
and in exchange youll deliver me into their hands im sure the andorians were impressed with your negotiating skills
they want to talk to you not kidnap you
if i agree to a meeting its simply legitimises their position
and if you dont these negotiations end before they begin
that may happen sooner than you realise while you were on the surface we detected three andorian vessels approaching theyll be here in less than five hours
they probably intend to resupply their troops on the surface we wont allow that
engaging an andorian vessel could be construed as an act of war
that will be their decision
both sides are responsible for what happens here
you dont understand the complexities of this situation
with all due respect ambassador why did you agree to let me go down there if you wont listen to my advice
i didnt request your help captain and i dont feel obliged to accept it
you claim the andorians are inflexible at least theyre willing to sit down and talk the balls in your court now
its a human expression it means the next move is yours
this isnt wise the colony hasnt been secured
didnt you hear the captain the ball is in our court
i dont like this with all the interference you wont be able to contact the ship if something goes wrong
theyre expecting us well be fine
those andorian shipsll be here in four hours
i plan on being back long before then
tpol said that territorial compromise they were talking about took eight years to work out
ill try to speed things up this time
bring them here as soon as they land and treat the vulcan with respect
yes sir
if i may speak
you dont have to i know what youre going to say we discovered this planet we made it livable it belongs to us dont worry itll be ours again
how by talking weve been trying that for a hundred years and its gotten us nowhere they stall and lie and make promises they never intend to keep we came here to fight why back down now
im willing to give archer another chance
you put too much faith in these pinkskins we dont know anything about them except that theyre friends of the vulcans
not always ive seen that for myself
if we attack now we can have the vulcans on the defensive before our ships arrive
your recommendation is noted
our troops are ready theres no reason to wait
enough i value your opinion tarah but that does not allow you to question my commands dismissed
theyll send some soldiers to meet us im afraid theyll want to blindfold you its just a security precaution
thank you for the reassurance now if you dont mind ill need a few moments of silence to prepare myself
of course
tpol
weapons fire i cant pinpoint the source
archer to enterprise
were still within their jamming range
i suggest we cancel the negotiations and return to your ship
for once were in full agreement
direct hit to our starboard engine main power is offline
now you see who youre dealing with captain
if you dont mind ambassador
were losing altitude two hundred metres
im going to bring us in on thrusters
one hundred metres fifty we need to reduce our speed
the ground is going to do that for us brace yourselves
any idea where we are
the southeast quadrant near the old spaceport i told you i negotiated the last accord i also served here
you were with the occupation force
as an intelligence officer a long time ago our current deployment has a base of operations that way about two and a half kilometres
i appreciate your help ambassador but were looking for the andorians
circumstances have altered our plans
i gave my word to shran i intend to keep it
shran just tried to kill us
we dont know that
i suppose you think our troops are responsible for this
sensors and communications are offline theres weapons fire flying all over the place we dont know what happened
are you that naive shran is using you
this is a man who couldnt sleep because he thought he owed me something i dont believe he asked me to come a dozen light years just so i could lead you into a trap and right now it seems like the best thing to do is to get a ceasefire in place the andorians wont agree to that until they talk to you in person i managed to keep us on course most of the way in we cant be more than a kilometre from shrans landing coordinates
how would you know we cant pick up anything through the interference
our scanners are more sophisticated than yours we detected weapons fire coming from the surface then your shuttle appeared to make an emergency landing somewhere in the colony
where
we havent been able to pinpoint their landing site but our units on the ground are already searching the high command instructed me to take steps to recover ambassador soval
and our officers
of course
we want to be involved in any rescue operation
we have more experience in these matters
i know i once saw one of your commando units blast the hell out of a rebel compound during a rescue mission
we wont allow this provocation to continue
you dont even know where they are do you really think its a good idea to go down there guns blazing
our response will be appropriate ill keep you informed commander
any luck
im trying sir but if the vulcans cant find them
see what you can do
yes sir
how far away are those andorian ships
three hours at their present speed
that shuttle was to be left alone i gave specific orders
and they were followed
then who fired those shots the vulcans i suppose trying to kill their own ambassador
is that so unlikely some of my men saw weapons fire coming from their positions its vulcan subterfuge im sure of it what better way for them to justify an invasion than to blame us for killing their envoy
they are devious but i doubt even they would go that far
you act as if they have some moral code they have no conscience only their precious logic theyll do anything to drive us off this planet we should never have agreed to negotiate
youre not happy with the way ive handled this situation
of course i am sir
the sector two report sir
put our positions on alert i want soval and the pinkskin brought to me alive if theyre looking for an excuse to attack we wont give it to them
ill see to it myself
perhaps you were farther off course than you thought
youve been here before i dont suppose youd care to help
its been almost a hundred years
i thought vulcans had exceptional memories
this is the old residential quarter according to our latest intelligence the andorians control the settlement west of here
if we keep moving this way we should be  down
not quite the warm welcome you expected captain
theyre not shooting at us
the vulcan units must be advancing their positions
we should try to make contact with them
i dont recommend sticking your neck out right now
what do you recommend wandering through these ruins until we find an andorian soldier and trust hes been informed not to shoot us on sight
ill take a look stay here
captain
thats an order no offence but my ears are less likely to draw fire than yours
what is their fixation with our ears
i believe theyre envious
do you realise youve picked up a slight human accent you were one of the most promising members of my staff tpol if youd stayed in san francisco youd be the assistant counsel by now you might even have a diplomatic posting of your own
i am aware of that
then why have you remained on enterprise
we believed they needed our help when they first developed warp drive that hasnt changed
captain archers record is evidence of that but there are others who can assist them
i find the work gratifying
gratification is an emotional indulgence you disagreed with our recommendation that archers mission be cancelled after the tragedy at paraaga two why
i was onboard enterprise at the time i felt my opinion would be welcomed
you believed you knew better than the high command that sounds a great deal like another emotion arrogance perhaps its time for you to consider another assignment
just because captain archer has earned my respect doesnt mean i have been contaminated by his emotions
did you make contact
no theyre pulling back lets keep moving
empty
theyre probably trying to reach the vulcans
no the pinkskin will want to keep his part of the bargain theyll be looking for shran
commander
you have something
i cant be sure you see this em differential here
thats the captain
its definitely a biosign im ninety percent sure its human
at least we know hes alive where is he
i need another hour
whats the status on those andorian ships
they just dropped out of warp theyll be here in thirteen minutes
i think the vulcans see them too theyre breaking orbit probably giving themselves room to manoeuvre
put the ship on tactical alert
get down go
over there
those are andorian weapons
hold your fire
how is he
it isnt lifethreatening but he needs medical attention
weve brought the vulcan ambassador to meet with commander shran
it looks like two of them one on top of that structure
and the other on the ground
if i can work my way around i might be able to come up from behind them
what do you expect me to do with this
make sure they dont see me
i havent fired a weapon in fifty years
you dont have to hit anything just keep them occupied really occupied or im not going to get very far
hey
range
fifty thousand kilometres theyre still heading right for the vulcan ships
the vulcans are charging weapons the andorians as well
travis lay in a new course i want you to put us right between them
aye sir
if you dont mind me asking what do you have in mind
drop your weapon ive never fired one of these before
im not sure if its set on stun
tpol cease fire
it doesnt have a stun setting
you fired on my shuttle youre trying to kill soval undermine everything that shran is trying to do here why do you want a war with the vulcans
all we want is a chance to fight for whats ours before cowards like shran negotiate it away
you can take that up with him lets go
were being hailed by the vulcans and the andorians
put em both on
this is commander tucker
captain telev of the imperial guard
commander i strongly recommend you withdraw to a safe distance
i agree we wouldnt want your vessel to be damaged by debris from the vulcan ships
we will not allow the andorians to land additional troops on paan mokar
its called weytahn and our personnel there have been attacked well provide whatever support they need
any vessel attempting to enter orbit will be fired upon
that includes yours subcommander
we appreciate your support commander tucker
dont ill open fire on any ship that makes an aggressive move phasecannons
locked and ready
this is not a starfleet matter
as long as my captain is stuck in the middle of your war zone it is
the andorians have made it impossible for us to recover captain archer by now hes most likely a casualty
dont count him out so fast weve managed to isolate his biosignature now why dont you both give him and ambassador soval a chance to do their jobs before we start a war up here
he was ready to kill me you saw for yourself apparently these pinkskins arent as honourable as you thought
are you all right i suppose i shot the ambassador to make my story more convincing
why would my lieutenant a loyal member of the imperial guard lie to me
commander it seems youre willing to resolve this situation through peaceful means do all your officers feel the same
have you considered there might be andorians who would want a war with vulcan
how long have i served with you followed your orders when it could have meant my life
shes not the only one who risked their life i said id bring soval to meet you and we damn near got killed getting him here i came because you asked me because you thought i could be trusted check sovals wound check our shuttle youll find andorian weapons signatures
is this true answer me
what did you expect me to do
follow my orders
orders to do nothing while you betray us its not too late to redeem yourself to make a stand
i intend to take her
there are others who feel this way youll see
see to the ambassadors wounds we have a lot to discuss
the vulcan ships are breaking formation theyre heading for the planet
the andorians are following sir
arm the forward phasecannons see if you can target their weapons
were being hailed from the surface its the captain
hold off malcolm put him through captain
nice to hear your voice trip
whats going on down there are you okay
tpol and i are fine were at the andorian command post ambassador sovals been injured but shrans medics are treating him
did you say shrans medics
hes just being a good host the andorians are allowing the vulcan ships to move in and pick up their people
glad you let us know
did you run into any problems up there
nothing we couldnt handle ill fill you in later
we had a pretty rough landing well need a ride back to the ship
ill send travis down in shuttlepod two
acknowledged archer out
put us back into orbit travis and cancel the tactical alert
the imperial council will not be satisfied until vulcan recognises our claim to weytahn
i believe someone once defined a compromise as a solution that neither side is happy with
in that case these talks have been extremely successful
i consider any negotiation that averts war to be a success
join me in a drink to celebrate our mutual dissatisfaction
vulcans dont drink but this occasion merits an exception
to the ceasefire it wouldnt have been possible without the help of our human friends
and to the successful continuation of these talks on andoria
i trust therell be more accomplished than just talk
with your permission ill escort ambassador soval to the airlock
of course
captain your presence here has not been overly meddlesome
i think he likes you pinkskin
i wouldnt go that far
biosigns
none that i can detect but its hull seems to be scattering our sensors
any idea what happened
im not reading any weapons signatures possibly some sort of accident
bring it into launch bay two
theres no windows im not sure whether this ends the bow or the stern
captain this might be a hatch
if it is its been fused shut with your permission sir
hes human
this was a human male a microcellular scan should tell us his age at the time of death apparently youre not the first humans out this far
whoever this is hes rewritten our history books can you get a dna sample
the tissue damage is extensive but i should be able to isolate a few fragments
if hes a member of starfleet his genetic profile is probably in our database run a comparison as soon as you can
absolutely
there arent any ships or inhabited systems for several light years
i wonder if this could be zephram cochrane they say he was piloting a oneman vessel when he disappeared
how could he have travelled this far
there were a lot of rumours after he was lost one of them said he was testing some kind of experimental warp ship any markings on the hull or control panels
we havent found any
the hull seems to absorb em radiation without all this damage it never would have shown up on our sensors
some kind of stealth ship so what do you think travis could this pilot have been a cargo hauler
were more than thirty light years from the nearest trade route i dont see how he could have made it out this far
maybe he got a ride from someone
thats got to be a world record for hitchhiking i still cant find any plasma exhaust ports not even a thruster quad
theres nothing here that looks like a power source
how did this thing make it into deep space without an engine
could be an escape pod
even an escape pod would need some kind of propulsion system
any new mission you havent told us about
i wish there was its possible the ship you found was launched from vega colony but theyre a long way behind you the earth cargo authority may have more information
phlox has sent a request to doctor cochranes family theyre transmitting his genetic profile
a hundred light years from earth you might have solved the greatest missing person case of the century
if we havent weve discovered an even bigger mystery
commander
registers as some kind of biomatter
organic circuitry
maybe we should get phlox to come down and take a look
not a bad idea
whats this
malcolm
i see it
good means im not hallucinating how can a ship be bigger on the inside than the outside
it could be a hologram
hand me that hyperspanner
youre not going down there
got to get my spanner back
we should call the bridge first let them know
say again malcolm
this gives space exploration a whole new meaning
ive read a few papers on spatial geometry i never heard a theory that would explain this the captainll never believe us hes going to have to see this for himself
what do you think a warp reactor
youre the engineer
looks like a breach overload of some kind
im picking up an energy signature its very faint
sir a vessels dropped out of warp theyre on an intercept course
its suliban
lets see it
minimal weapons i dont believe its a combat ship
were being hailed
you have something that belongs to us
i dont believe ive had the pleasure
we have a salvage claim on the vessel in your launch bay one of our cell ships discovered it three days ago we were sent to retrieve it
that ships an earth vessel the pilots human
im not interested in the corpse decompress your launch bay and release the vessel
im curious whats your interest in that ship theres not much left
the vessel now
theyre charging weapons
you might want to contact your superiors ask for a man named silik hell tell you i dont respond well to threats
this could be a release pin  lets get it to engineering
forward plating is holding
bring us about travis power the phasecannons see what you can do about their weapons
tucker to the bridge the comms down
commander
someones trying to open launch bay two
lock them out
i cant
archer to trip  send a security team down there return fire
their weapons have been disabled
target their engines and bring the grappler on line
sir
they wanted that ship pretty badly id like to know why
theyre moving off
stay with them
ive lost them sir
it was heavily shielded whatever this thing is it must be pretty important
whats your guess
might be the black box
it could it tell us what happened maybe even who built the vessel
thats assuming we can get it working it seems to use the same organic circuitry as the rest of the ship captain i got to take you down into that chamber youre not going to believe your eyes
bigger on the inside
sickbay to captain archer
archer
i need to see you immediately
i managed to find only a few undamaged cells but they were enough to complete a genetic analysis
is there a match in the starfleet database
no but i did discover that our guest is no ordinary human i found an unusual deviation in this nucleotide sequence at first i thought i was looking at some kind of mutation but there was something familiar about the chromosome structure so i widened my search to include the interspecies database this nucleotide sequence is vulcan
how did a human end up with vulcan dna
the likeliest explanation is that he had at least one vulcan ancestor further back than a greatgrandparent
thats not possible we havent known the vulcans long enough
i also found genetic material belonging to several other species this sequence is terrelian theres another i cant identify i believe this individual is the result of several generations of interspecies breeding
thank you doctor tpol
a database from the future
our timetravelling friend daniels left it in his quarters
im not certain daniels would approve of this
well keep it to ourselves
a vulcan cruiser i dont recognise the configuration
thats because it hasnt been built yet
few vulcans have ever chosen to mate with another species
worried about contaminating your genome with a little human dna
there are significant biological differences between the species its unlikely we could reproduce humans and vulcans
that could be it
the dorsal section is the wrong shape
if a human and a vulcan did have a child i wonder if hed have pointed ears there i think thats it look at the commission date thats almost nine hundred years from now daniels talked about historians from the future people who traveled back to study the past that could be what this pilot was doing
this says its powered by a temporal displacement drive
if the suliban get their hands on this theyll take it apart  maybe learn how the engines work that could change the course of the temporal cold war
assuming the vessel is from the future why havent they retrieved it
archer
sir theres an alien vessels approaching at high warp
suliban
no sir we cant identify them
twenty thousand kilometres and closing
tpol
the vessels tholian theyre extremely xenophobic the high command has had limited contact with them captain its unusual for tholians to travel this far from their system
im getting unusual thermal readings its awfully warm inside that ship more than two hundred degrees
theyre believe to be a nonhumanoid species
open a channel this is captain archer of the starship
jonathan archer please establish communication
is there something we can do for you
we were sent to retrieve the vessel
id like to know how you heard about that ship
it is dangerous to you temporal radiation
thanks for the warning but we cant give it to you
theyve locked on to us with a tractor beam
were losing speed
hull plating arm the aft torpedoes
that beams interfering with our targeting scanners
release us or ill destroy the ship in our launch bay  do you hear me
what did he say
i dont know but i dont think he was paying you a compliment
i wonder if theres anyone else who thinks they have a claim on that ship
may i join you
please
i found another nucleotide sequence in the pilots genome it appears to be rigelian that corpse is full of surprises  i didnt realise how late it was until my stomach reminded me it was time to eat you seem to be engrossed in your work as well
the captain asked me to perform a metallurgical analysis of the vessels hull
anything noteworthy
ive discovered several unusual alloys one of them is in a semifluidic state
more mysteries
to say the least
i understand captain archer believes that the vessel travelled here from the future
thats his theory
genetic anomalies unexplainable alloys the evidence seems to be mounting
perhaps
the vulcan science directorate theyve always been rather reluctant to embrace unorthodox ideas after they review our findings i have a feeling they might reconsider their opinion of time travel
its not an opinion its simple logic
there was a time when denobulans believed they were the only intelligent species in the galaxy needless to say it was quite a surprise when the bsaari made first contact many refused to accept the truth even with the evidence standing right in front of them it took some time and it wasnt easy but eventually we were forced to reevaluate our beliefs
are you saying you believe time travel is possible
surprises subcommander i believe in embracing surprises
i prefer to embrace logic if youll excuse me doctor
good night
all right lets start reinitialising the power grid
assuming that is the power grid it boggles the mind if you think about it
what does
that ship could be from the thirty first century when i was young i always wanted to build a time machine see the future
youre probably the kind of person that jumps to the end of a book before you read it
dont tell me youve never wondered what it would be like how our mission will turn out
wondering about the future and knowing it are two different things
if daniels came here and offered you a chance to go to the thirty first century you wouldnt take it
some things are better left a mystery
and you call yourself an explorer
wheres the fun in exploring if you know how it all turns out hand me that microcaliper suppose you could look into some future book and find out the name of the woman youre going to marry would you want to know it
absolutely think of all the awkward first dates i could avoid
fine so one day you meet jane doe you go out a few times and you pop the question she says i do and the two you live happily ever after
sounds perfect
now did you marry her for love or because some book told you to
if were happily ever after what difference does it make
well weve got power now weve got to figure out how to tap into these organic circuits
theyre similar to the ones in the cockpit
we might be able to salvage some of them build an interface
now if i had a chance to see the past id jump at it i always wanted to meet a stegosaurus
hed probably make a quick meal of you
the stegosaurus was an herbivore
if i could travel back in time i know exactly what year id pick 1588
what happened in 1588
england defeated the spanish armada
im sure some named reed had a lot to do with that
now if i had a chance to see the past id jump at it i always wanted to meet a stegosaurus
hed probably make a quick meal of you
the stegosaurus was an herbivore
it seems like we were just in here if i could travel back i know exactly what year id pick
1588
howd i know you were going to say that
i think were spending far too much time together
now if i had a chance to see the past id jump at it
i always wanted to meet a stegosaurus
hed probably make a quick meal of you
the stegosaurus was a herbivore
it was the weirdest thing when we were standing next to the ship it felt like we were having the same conversation over and over again
i cant find anything wrong with either of you
we didnt imagine what happened
captain the craft is emitting some type of highenergy particles
this may be the temporal radiation the tholians warned us about
weve spent a fair amount of time around that ship
the particle densitys quite low its unlikely to have any lasting effects
how do you explain what happened
the radiation could have affected your perception of time
or maybe they really were reliving the same moment seal off launch bay two and evacuate the surrounding sections i dont want to take any chances  how are you coming with the black box
the powers online but we still cant access the data
let me know as soon as you find anything dismissed
can i speak with you
the radiation could spread to other sections affect more systems
well keep an eye on it the vulcans are only a few hours away
im not certain well survive that long weve attracted the attention of two hostile species its logical to assume theyre searching for us
im pretty sure we can steer clear of them
perhaps you should destroy the vessel
im not going to do that im tired of these factions interfering with our century its time we took a more active interest in this war gathered some intelligence ourselves
assuming for the moment the temporal cold war exists i believe we shouldnt get involved
like it or not weve been involved since we left spacedock daniels hinted that there were other factions in this conflict maybe the tholians are working for one of them
your curiosity is placing enterprise in unnecessary danger
this is the first chance weve had to get some answers im not going to pass it up the vulcans can get that ship back to earth in a few weeks starfleetll take it from there
captain
i told you ive made my decision
if the suliban return they may be cloaked i recommend we go to tactical alert
what do you have
its what we dont have this isnt a black box we thought it was a data storage matrix but after we got the power running it started generating a subspace signature i think its a microtransmitter some kind of emergency beacon
bridge to captain archer several suliban vessels are approaching
on my way
acknowledged
the ships will be within weapons range in twenty seconds
go to maximum warp
theyre matching our speed
how long to the rendezvous point
less than three minutes
contact the talkir let them know were bringing company
no response were being hailed by the suliban
i see you brought some friends with you
drop out of warp and prepare to be boarded
or what youre not going to risk any more damage to that ship
theyre charging weapons
take a look at your longrange sensors theres a vulcan combat cruiser a few million kilometres from here unless you want to upset them i suggest you turn around
the vulcans wont risk their ship for an earth vessel
aft cannon return fire
were losing ventral plating
the vulcans
six hundred thousand kilometres
direct hit to the launch bay doors theyre trying to blast them open
hold your course and speed
two hundred thousand kilometres
take us out of warp
biosigns
the crews alive the vessel is disabled
their comm systems down
captain
take us back to warp
engines are down
weapons
theyre offline too the hull platings depolarising
the cell ships have dropped out of warp
i never thought id be glad to see the suliban
trip we could use warp engines
right about now
the antimatter injectors are fused ill need a few hours to replace them
how about weapons
every power relay on the ships been scrambled
then forget everything else get that beacon working
sir
whoever built that ship might be able to send help
aye captain
even if youre correct its unlikely help will arrive in time
how long would it take to remove one of the torpedo warheads arm it manually
four minutes less if i had some help i recommend moving the warhead as little as possible once we remove it
then well bring the torpedo to the launch bay work on it there  you have the bridge
im going to hold you to that four minutes
it was only an estimate sir
they dont make this easy do they
im going to release the couplings youll need to disconnect the power conduits the blue and red ones first turn the release counterclockwise until you feel it detach
commander
i need that power module
yes sir
all right hand me a microcaliper
bridge to captain archer
go ahead
the suliban have lost more than half of their ships
you dont have much time
were working as fast as we can
stand by
sir if youll hold it by the locking brace
im going to hold you to that four minutes
it was only an estimate sir its happening again weve had this conversation before
youre right how far do you think we got last time
im not certain
i think we may have removed the warhead
if times not repeating outside the launch bay the tholians could be close
wed better hurry the red and blue conduits right
the cellships theyve been destroyed
how many
all of them the tholians are on an intercept course
theyre hailing us
give us the vessel
were prepared to surrender it to you but our launch bay doors took heavy damage were going to need more time i have a repair team working on it but they estimate it will take
two of their ships are approaching the saucer section eighty metres forty
theyve locked on to both docking ports
seal the hatches and send security teams
get to the control room ill take it from here
aye captain
im going to hold you to that four minutes
it was only an estimate sir
how many times do you think weve done this
at least twice maybe more
lets hope weve got it down by now
theyre cutting through the doors
control room
lets get those doors open
now
id recommend putting more distance between us and that ship
now
tpol to captain archer
theyve neutralised the warhead
on our way
sir its gone
gone
it dematerialised and its not aboard the tholian ships
theyre disengaging
why didnt they fire on us
good question
they may have only wanted the vessel
the vulcans
their warp drive is damaged but life support is stable
lets see if we can give them a hand  prep a shuttlepod have doctor phlox meet us in launch bay one
aye sir
i wish wed had more time to explore that ship who knows how many other rooms were down there looks like they sent the whole kit and caboodle back to the thirty first century
theres no evidence to support that
well theres no evidence to contradict it either what i dont understand is how quickly everything disappeared that beacon was online for less than a minute
youre forgetting that time is irrelevant to these people
irrelevant
if that vessel was from the future whoever sent it had plenty of time to locate the signal and then travel back to any point in time to retrieve it
unfortunately time isnt irrelevant in my engine room ive got repairs to finish see you later subcommander
im going to contact the high command apologise for the trouble we caused them
as the captain of the talkir pointed out a ship can be replaced
i also need to thank them for helping us out
im sure the gesture would be appreciated the high command has asked me to prepare a report on this incident with your permission
by all means i wonder if theyll believe that humans and vulcans will be swapping chromosomes one day
theyre more likely to believe in time travel
enterprise to shuttlepod one enterprise to shuttlepod one captain archer
please respond enterprise to shuttlepod one captain archer please respond
lieutenant
they took some weapons fire main powers offline gravity plating life support
biosigns
none
captains starlog supplemental trip and i have left ketoenol where we had        a successful first contact with the enolians we also found time to squeeze in a little r  r
theres only one more log entry after that something about a pan zan match
pan zan
its a sporting event the captain said it was the closest thing to water polo hes seen        since we left earth
sensor logs
too badly damaged to be much help
if i may ive been running a forensic analysis there are traces of human blood on the        deck and bulkheads both the captains and commander tuckers lieutenant reed believes they were abducted
if they were they didnt go without a fight
set a course for ketoenol
ill be right back
captain
you in charge here if youre not i need to speak to your superior officer
captain
im okay
id stay quiet if i were you        the guards dont like questions
do you know where theyre taking us i heard something about canamar i assume thats where were going
its a penal colony
is this how your justice system works ship people off to prison without a trial
theres a processing station in orbit youll be tried sentenced and sent down to the surface
what if youre not guilty
were all guilty as far as theyre concerned why did they take you
they think were smugglers
i wouldnt want to be accused of smuggling theyll probably make an example of you
were on an exploratory mission we believe our captain and chief engineer were abducted        after visiting your planet
abducted by whom
we dont know
were the busiest trading outpost in this system we get thousands of visitors        every day unfortunately that attracts just as many thieves and smugglers as you might imagine        my officers are kept quite busy i wish i could help you
let us send you their descriptions perhaps you could find out if any of your officers        have seen them
anything else on the menu
if you dont like it give it to me
i like it just fine
give it to me
eat your own
you dont listen too well
then why dont you save yourself the trouble and stop talking to me
thanks
you should be careful with the nausicaans nasty tempers
thanks for the advice
what were you smuggling latinum enolian spice wine
were not smugglers im the chief engineer of a starship hes my captain
captain of a starship interesting i should have tried that when they took me        it might have helped captain zoumas
a patrol ship intercepted their shuttle as it was leaving orbit
where are they
on board one of our transports they were carrying what appeared to be contraband        so they were taken into custody
are your patrols in the habit of arresting innocent people
smuggling is rampant in this system my men have orders to board unfamiliar vessels        mistakes can be made
you certainly made one this time
ive contacted the transport theyre expecting you these are the coordinates
i trust youll accompany us to ensure there are no further mistakes
what if enterprise doesnt find the shuttlepod
hopefully therell be a judge or someone on that processing station we can talk to
and if not
you might want to make friends with that nausicaan
are you archer youre being released a ships coming to retrieve you
released why
were not criminals
how much did they pay you to let them go
quiet
im innocent too ill pay you
i said quiet
were all innocent how much
thats enough keep still all of you
keep still all of you if you want to get out of here
i told you we needed the pilot
hes alive
does he look like hes in any condition to fly this ship
he tried to get a weapon
just watch them
what about the rest of us
youll be released soon enough
when where are we going
be patient youll find out
im sure were all grateful for your courageous effort but weve been in these restraints for three days        couldnt you
quiet ill see if i can access navigation
you ever fly a warp ship before its harder than you think
hes right
you hit the wrong control you could overload the plasma manifolds or shut down the        antimatter containment field wed all end up a cloud of ionised gas
youre a pilot
a damn good one im a smuggler remember
come with me
my partners an engineer i could use his help
just you
i thought you were a pilot
every ships different give me some time
these look like landing thrusters        attitude control warp stabilizers
navigation
navigation
theres a binary system four light years from here
this one
set a course
which planet
ill tell you that when we get there
were not going to get very far in a stolen
just get me to that system
you know what happens if he dies if you get him medical attention itll work in your favour        ill tell the magistrate you showed compassion
the guard said you were going to be released why
because were innocent i have friends who wanted to keep doing business with me        they made a few discreet payments and now im innocent i would have been off this ship by now        if you hadnt staged your little revolt i hope youve thought this through
every detail
im curious howd you get out of those restraints you couldnt have        a lock pick the guards would have found it
would they subdermal implants they depolarise triburnium alloys
how did you know you were going to need them
i served seven years on canamar before i escaped i dont intend to go back        so i left prepared
i dont know what you have in mind but im involved now        i dont want to go to canamar any more than you do if we run into trouble my partner could help
what is that
subspace transceiver
i hope youre not trying to send a message
im taking it offline it leaves a subspace signature even when its not transmitting        someone could track us
now its offline
im picking up an automated distress signal
thats one of our frequencies
your transport vessel
we have hundreds of ships i dont know the signatures for every one
the signal originated near our rendezvous coordinates but theyve stopped transmitting
try hailing them
no response
increase our speed to warp four point two
were still several hours away but we have patrol ships in that area
contact them
have you ever tried tojal
what
theres nothing like it but you have to eat it before it cools otherwise itll congeal
sounds terrific
its the first thing im going to have when were off this ship where do you think theyre taking us
ask him
ill just wait and see the enolians wont stop looking for us well be fugitives        i was thinking of having my face reconfigured theres a surgeon on burala prime who can do it        he could help you as well
ill take my chances with my own face
have you ever been to burala prime
cant say i have
if you ever go avoid the polar islands the people are friendly but the cold        is unbearable nothing but ice and glaciers i was stranded there for three months        when some colleagues of mine decided to leave without me
imagine that
the day i got lost that was the worst fourteen hours it took me fourteen hours to find my way        back to the outpost i lost three toes to frostbite ive walked with a slight limp ever since        not that youd notice im going to get that surgeon to do some work on my foot as well        maybe he can replace the missing toes
excuse me can i change seats
im surprised we havent crossed paths before
were new to this region we used to work mostly in the sol system
sol
thats our sun our homeworld is called earth
what is it
two vessels approaching from aft
let me see them
enolian patrol ships
theyve found us
more quickly than i expected when you were taking the transceiver offline        you didnt activate it accidentally
you think i sent a distress call i told you we should have gotten rid of this ship        its too easy to track theyre charging weapons
do the same
those are heavily armed patrol ships were only a transport
we have weapons use them
were outgunned id rather take my chances on canamar
and id rather not now charge the weapons
theyre targeting our engines
return fire
no
im warning you
we dont have the firepower if we attack those ships theyll destroy us        i think i can get us out of this but ill need tuckers help
whats happening
if those are patrol ships youre going to be recaptured
shouldnt we be getting to the escape pods
the next person who speaks goes out the airlock he needs to concentrate
trip whats your status
almost there
let us go i dont want to die tied up like an animal
ready when you are
cease fire cease fire we surrender
pressurize your docking port and prepare to be boarded        or our next shot will breach your hull
acknowledged
now
the plasma vents are open
theyve taken damage propulsion is down on both ships
lock weapons
we should get out of here while we can
target their warp reactors
theres no need
as soon as they repair the damage theyll come after us again
do you think the enolians are just going to give up if we destroy two of their ships        all im wanted for is smuggling i dont need to add murder charges to it        let me get us out of here
all right
is this really necessary i just saved your skin and you still dont trust me        do you know how much power flows through those plasma conduits
how much
a lot i could have been electrocuted the least you could do is say thanks
thanks
that was nice it reminds me of the time i was on
shut up
both our ships were disabled before the transport escaped        my superiors dont want our patrols taking any more chances theyve issued orders to destroy the prison transport
are your superiors aware that there are two innocent humans aboard
theyre more concerned with the man who planned this escape they were able to match his voiceprint        to a prisoner named kuroda lorehn he was responsible for many crimes some of them brutal        theyre determined to stop him
and were determined to get our people back
then i suggest you find them before our patrols do
that was a clever trick igniting the plasma
i used it once before outrunning a customs vessel near coridan
you obviously ran out of clever tricks otherwise you wouldnt be here what happened
every ship leaving ketoenol was being boarded and searched        to get through the checkpoint i said i was a starship captain and tucker was my engineer        i made quite a point about how i was on a peaceful mission of exploration
they didnt believe you
what do you think they turned our shuttle inside out found my cargo and we wound up here
my good fortune you should consider coming with us your partner too
doing what
i have some business i wasnt able to finish before i was arrested it could be profitable
im a smuggler im not good at much else
trust me youll be very interested when you find out what i have in mind
its not as if i have a lot of options right now before were going to work together        id like to know where were headed
the fourth planet theres a trading outpost called tamaal
and then
a ships going to meet us there this transport draws too much attention
once you get past the texture they really dont taste that bad        the fun part is keeping them in your mouth they jump around until you crunch down on them
enough
is something wrong
no i love hearing how delicious melvaran mud fleas are or about the time you spent        two hours with an orion slave girl or the miracles doctors can perform these days getting rid of fluvian fungus
well what makes you think i want to hear your stories
i havent told you any you wont let me get a word in edgewise
i didnt realise i was being so annoying we seemed to be getting along so well i just thought it might be nice to have a pleasant conversation before i spend the next ten years in a penal colony
look im sorry i snapped at you but this isnt exactly the best place to socialise
this thruster assembly took a lot of damage we should have tucker take a look at it
dont bother
youre not the one who has to fly this thing
it wont be flying much longer  im not hungry
you havent eaten for two days
i can wait
dont be a fool
i said im not hungry
prison rations
its better than nothing
youve obviously never spent time on a penal colony i was fourteen when i first tasted those rations        ive had enough for one lifetime
sounds like you started your career early
i was young but i was no criminal
no
my father and i were working at a transport yard on ketoenol a supervisor        accused me of stealing a brace of latinum i had nothing to do with it        but they couldnt find anyone else to blame i was sentenced to five years at duronom
that sounds pretty severe
enolian guards are known for their severity havent you seen that by now        i learned far more in prison than my father could have ever taught me        after i was released i chose to put my new skills to use i suppose i should be grateful        if it wasnt for the enolian guard my life would have been quite dull
welcome to tamaal where are your friends
theyll be here
do you have landing coordinates
were not landing theyre going to dock with us
what about the others are you going to let them go to prison
no before we leave youre going to set this ship on a decaying orbit
itll be incinerated
as far as anyone will be able to tell we crashed trying to land
why kill all these people just leave them
no one will be looking for us if they think were dead        if you dont like it you can always go back to your seat        i may not know how to fly this ship but im sure i can figure out how to crash it
the transports dropped out of warp its entered a binary system        looks like theyre heading for the fourth planet
tamaal its a large trading outpost with over two million inhabitants
a good place to get lost in the crowd
drop to impulse take us into the system any human biosigns
two its them i recommend we use the transporter once were in range
youre forgetting thats a prison ship its heavily shielded
where you going
the docking hatch was damaged by the patrol ships kuroda wants tucker to see if he can repair it
nice of you to visit
who are we docking with
your guess is as good as mine
hes taking us off on a shuttle then he plans to crash the ship
i hope youve got something else in mind
we cant wait for enterprise weve got to try to take control think you can handle him
yeah piece of cake
theres a small vessel dropping out of warp
patrol ship
i dont think so four biosigns theyre all enolian
its not one of our ships
magnify wheres it heading
the fourth planet
theyre trying to hail the prison transport theyre not getting a response
they may have come to rescue kuroda how heavily armed is it
fore and aft particle cannons nothing we cant handle
my friends will be here soon lay in a descent course
their ship might be big enough to hold everyone here why dont we take them along
we have already discussed this
trip
hows that docking port coming
i need a minute its a big job
do your best
listen i know we kind of got off on the wrong foot no hard feelings but now that were friends        i could use a hand
youre the engineer
true but im having trouble getting the intake valve open i guess i dont have the muscle for it        unless im mistaken kuroda wants this hatch repaired
that one if you could turn it counterclockwise yeah a little more        its got to go at least ninety degrees thats it you almost got it
what are you doing
they said they were going to let us go
they lied theyre planning to kill you all of you
how do you know that
youre going to get us sent to canamar
keep it down
stay here
watch out
do you know how to repair that docking hatch its not easy were in a decaying orbit        shoot me and youll die with the others
get to work
you dont have to kill these people
move
you should thank me
what wheres archer
hes with them repairing the docking hatch they said theres a shuttle coming for us        im sorry i had to intervene but you didnt give me much choice youre lucky they didnt kill you        kuroda was furious but everythings fine now theyre going to set us free youre welcome
theyve docked
i see my message got through
loud and clear sir
captain would you mind
who are these people
this will open the restraints
get everyone        on that shuttle
anything i can do
not unless you have a spare thruster assembly is everyone off
just about
ill be right there
captain travis says he cant maintain the docking seal much longer
he wont have to lets go
we need to break orbit
its too late weve lost thrusters
youre lying
weve got to get out
kuroda its over
i wont go back
its now or never sir
weve got some men in there who could use your help
and you
ill be fine
on behalf of the enolian government id like to extend our apologies for this inconvenience        my superiors will want
trip
er captain captain my superiors will want a report on
ill give you one right now kurodas dead the other eleven prisoners are under guard        as youre aware my engineer and i were falsely arrested we almost wound up in canamar        makes me wonder how many others dont belong there you wanted a report youve got one
sensors cant identify its hull composition there doesnt even seem to be a warp signature
its approaching at warp six
how big is it
its big more than five hundred metres across
were in visual range
put it up
look familiar
its not in the vulcan database
try hailing them
no response sir im not even detecting a transceiver on board
theyre gaining on us sir
what the hell is that
tactical alert
weapons arent charging sir theyre offline phase cannons torpedoes
tucker to the bridge
go ahead
whats going on captain the engines just went down
warp or impulse
both
hold on trip have they dropped out of warp
theres no way to tell our sensors cant penetrate their hull
what about our life support
fully operational
thats one piece of good news any biosigns out there
none that i can detect
rotate the dorsal camera
hold it there tilt up about thirty degrees get closer
the vapour doesnt contain any elements our sensors can identify
any atmosphere
mostly helium trace amounts of xenon
prep a shuttlepod trip meet me and malcolm in launch bay one
aye sir
youre in charge keep a channel open
captain look at this
the atmospheres changing seventy six percent nitrogen twenty one percent oxygen
somebody seems to know what we like to breathe
whats the temperature
eighteen degrees
florida in november
lets see what we can find
look at that
im not reading anything its like theyre not there
they sure look there to me
if there arent any lifeforms here then who modified the atmosphere
i doubt its a coincidence
captain
we may not be detecting any biosigns but those things sure look alive to me
are you okay trip
what the hell happened
thats what i was about to ask you
i think i was up on the ceiling with those things i was looking down at the three of us but not with my eyes i cant explain it
we should get him back to the ship
i was in tarpon springs too swimming with lisa she was afraid it was getting too dark
it sounds like you were dreaming commander
i know the difference between a dream and something really happening
were a hundred and fifty light years from earth trip
im telling you i was there
im not detecting any parasites or lifeforms or wisps of smoke he seems in perfect working order
he said he had some kind of outofbody experience
i dont forget florida captain i dont care how far away it is i was there
its a very common hallucination returning to a familiar place
what happened to the comm you three talking about me
youre clear commander free to go
thanks doc
you sure youre all right
im fine i cant believe how amazing it was
id prefer to keep you in sickbay for a few days but i cant afford to i need you to get those engines back online
ill see what i can do
let me know if you take another trip to tarpon beach
tarpon springs ill keep you posted
i want those weapons back online too
ill see what i can do
come in
its like were in the belly of the beast
we have no reason to believe their motives are hostile
theyre holding my ship hostage
we dont know that
we dont look out there do you see any stars our engines are offline our weapons seems kind of hostile to me
i suppose it depends on how you look at it
is there something you wanted to see me about
ensign sato is trying to communicate with the life forms
and
nothing yet ive spoken to a number of officers they say the crew is concerned but remaining calm
ive got to get them out of here
i tried reinitialising the plasma flow but the power grid isnt charging commander are you all right sir can i get you something
im fine goodbye sir
rostov to captain archer
go ahead
im sorry to bother you sir but i think there might be something wrong with commander tucker
what do you mean wrong
he was confused and seemed to think i was his superior officer
ill be right down
hes not here sir he left engineering
did he say where he was going
no sir
im afraid not captain
archer to commander tucker  find him
commander
commander charles tucker iii
hungry
yes its all very good have you ever tried this
its called bread youve never eaten it before
ive never eaten anything before
wheres commander tucker
im here charles tucker iii
wheres the man who used to be charles tucker
hes exploring another realm my realm but hell be back
i want him back now
please trust me hes experiencing things he never thought he could
where is he
its not a question of where hes no longer corporeal but he will be again i assure you
when we were outside we saw a wisp of vapour penetrate him did you have anything to do with that
wisp interesting word wisp wisp yes i suppose you could call us that wisp
where do you come from
we live in subspace we travel through it were explorers like you
why did you take commander tucker
its been a long time since weve encountered corporeal beings after we performed the first crossing with your commander we realised we were compatible youre very interesting trapped in bodies that need maintenance you have gender you require mates to reproduce you eat food we were like you once but we evolved now we can learn how our ancestors lived
i want my crewman and i want my ship released
captain
your crewman will be returned you claim to be an explorer captain open your mind to new possibilities
what about tucker
ive enjoyed my time with you
sir
wow
wow what
i was riding right alongside hopalong cassidy chasing some bad guys then i was with lisa again except this time we were snow sailing in new zealand then i was eight years old maybe nine picking up leaves with my dad but it wasnt a dream captain it was as real as im sitting here they told me you can try it anyone on the crew
who told you
they did the ones i was with
i thought you were with hopalong cassidy and your girlfriend
i was but its hard to explain you should try it youll understand what im talking about you all should try it
take him to sickbay
captain im fine
well let the doctor decide how fine you are
commander
something smells funny
theyve released the ship and commander tucker theyve done everything youve asked have you considered they may have been telling the truth when they said they were just curious about us
captains starlog supplemental now that the doctors given trip a clean bill of health my primary concern is to get enterprise out of here but trip tells me itll be awhile before he can get the engines online from what we can tell these life forms have no mass noncorporeal beings thats got to be a first for starfleet tpol thinks they just want to get to know us maybe shes right maybe i dont trust them because theyre so different id hate to think that was the case  computer pause come in
i hope im not disturbing you
everything all right
im not certain one of those beings appeared in sickbay a few minutes ago it entered me right here
but my physiology must not have been compatible it left almost immediately
are you sure youre all right
im fine but it was disturbing the lifeform was trying very hard to reach me
im going to b deck
b deck is fine are you a female
sir
your gender you are a female correct
last time i checked
i am a male
im aware of that lieutenant
there seem to be a number of anatomical differences
sir
come in
subcommander
is there something i can do for you
you are very beautiful are you aware that you are the most attractive woman on board this ship
do you think its appropriate for you to be here at this hour
would you mind taking off your clothing id like to learn more about your anatomy
have you been drinking
if we are to engage in mating it would be easier if you disrobed
tpol to captain archer
go ahead
would you please come to my quarters with a security team
were on our way
are you afraid of me you shouldnt be
im capable of defending myself
what is it like being a female is it much different
i wouldnt know
if youd allow the crossing youd find out
i dont understand
if you came to us you could experience what its like to be male wouldnt that be helpful to you
ive never thought about it
you should were capable of letting you experience anything you wish for it would be a shame not to take advantage of that
this isnt lieutenant reed
enough humans dont like doing things without their consent when are you planning to return malcolm reed
that depends
oh does it lets see how much you enjoy experiencing the human condition locked in reeds quarters
tucker
theyve got malcolm i need the ship
ready to go on my command
theyre going to give him back arent they
well see
what did you do with the er
a security detail locked him in malcolms quarters get it down trip
right away sir you heard him  lets try to prime the deuterium pumps and fire up the injectors tucker to ensign cook
yes sir
i need you and two other engineers down here right away
ill see who i can find
commander
quickly please tucker out something wrong
run into a problem
problem no everythings fine
did you have any luck priming the pumps
i have no idea how to do that this engine is very complex
stay here ill be right back tucker to the captain
go ahead trip
its rostov sir i think you need to get malcolm
i mean whoevers running security down here right away
hoshi get a security team to engineering have them put crewman rostov in his quarters
aye sir captain weve been getting reports from all over the ship some of the crew are acting very strange
then were going to need more than one security team find out whos acting strange and have them confined to their quarters
how do we know the security officers are okay
for the moment were going to have to hope they are  start working on a way to figure out whos themselves and whos not maybe phlox can help you
commander
run into a problem
no sir just ready to calibrate the dilithium matrix
great wait till i give you the signal
we polarised the hull plating as soon as we detected that ship obviously it didnt do any good whats keeping them from taking all of us
archer
youve got impulse engines back captain
thanks trip
hold our position
i thought you said we needed to get out of here
theyve got malcolm and god knows how many others until we find a way to get them back were not going anywhere
whats the big secret
we thought it best not to discuss this over the comm we dont know whos been taken
what have you got
it was simpler than i thought elevated acetylcholine levels in the autonomic nervous
doctor whatever youve got we need to put it to work
the subcommander programmed the medical computer its modifying this handscanner as we speak
get to work as soon as youre ready
tucker to ensign mayweather
go ahead sir
im a little shorthanded travis
think i could get you to go back to the starboard nacelle and repolarise the warp coils
no problem sir
call me when you get to the catwalk
im on my way
there are two here
ensign cole and crewman rossi
mayweather to the bridge
go ahead
one of those things just followed me up the starboard strut but when i got into the catwalk it didnt come through there must be something keeping it from getting in here
then youd better stay where you are
aye sir
archer to commander tucker
yes captain
is there some kind of shielding
in the nacelles that might keep these aliens from getting in
the catwalks reinforced with osmium alloy but its hard to say if that would do it
travis thinks it will
i need you to stop whatever youre doing and transfer all command functions
to the starboard catwalk were going to have to get everybody in there
im on it
i want you and tpol to get the crew up there as quickly as you can hoshi
it would be best if they stayed where they were
what
were offering them a great opportunity they may never get another chance to experience existence as we do
security to the bridge youre taking over my crew why
i understand how you may be frightened by all this losing your substance existing as perceptive energy but youll be grateful once youve made the crossing i promise you
were kind of fond of our substance were not very anxious to give it up
those whove preceded you are safe and happy theyll understand
are you doing this for our benefit or for yours
escort ensign sato to her quarters
youll understand
how many
fifty eight including us
and outside
twenty four locked in their quarters and doctor phlox
you okay travis
im fine sir thank you
trip
i saw him down near the command compartment
thanks
we need to learn more about these life forms
what we need is to get our people back
its illogical to believe we can do that without learning more about the aliens intentions
do you have something in mind
id like your permission to leave the catwalk
you wouldnt have a chance one of those things would take you before you got back to the saucer section
not necessarily if a lifeform attempts to exchange its consciousness with mine i believe i can prevent it
what makes you think that
no offence captain but the vulcan mind is far more disciplined that yours it can resist temptations emotions and i believe invasions by these lifeforms
even if youre right what would you accomplish
if an alien attempts this transfer there may be a brief period when our minds are conjoined its possible i can ascertain their motives
its too dangerous i wont let you do it
theres no other choice
and if youre wrong
its a risk im willing to take
well im not theyve already taken twenty four people im not going to give them another one
you told me you trust my judgment trust it now unless you have another suggestion
sickbay
theres been an accident
hoshi
hoshi satos been injured i dont know how to repair the damage to her body
what happened
her leg is fractured shes in considerable pain she needs assistance
im armed if youre near the door step away
shes on the floor she cant move
theres nothing the matter with you
i need to find the rest of your crew where are they
im glad i brought you along
doctor phlox
is everything going all right doc
more or less
good tpol and i are going to need your help
subcommander tpol
have you succeeded
phlox to captain archer
did you find her
im with her now shes not acting like the others
but shes certainly not herself
doesnt sound like thats the outcome she expected
her neural pathways are hyperstimulated
damn it youd better take her to her quarters
yes captain
come with me everything will be all right
im afraid i have to insist i promise you
tpol what is my name subcommander
theyre lying to us
my name
we dont have time for this phlox i have to get to the captain
their ship is deteriorating and they have no way to repair it they cant survive in space
so they are doing this to save themselves
eighty two of them are one for every crewman on enterprise
how many of them are there
hundreds the rest will try to find another vessel of corporeal beings wheres commander tucker
im not sure
please find him
if the commander can find a way to shield enterprise we can leave the catwalk and go to warp
and lose a third of the crew
two thirds will survive
unacceptable were going to find a way to get them back
that may be difficult
can they survive in a host thats dead
it would be no different than being exposed to space theyd die
archer to phlox
yes captain
are you doing all right
were okay
how long do you think well be in here ensign
im sure the captain will get us out as soon as he can has anyone seen commander tucker
no sir
not for a while i think he was down there
thanks
well have to purge the carbon dioxide within twenty seconds of respiratory failure
thatll give you enough time to resuscitate them
oh yes
its enough time dont forget to close off the ventilation to the starboard nacelle
we wouldnt want the gas to affect you and the others
understood
sorry captain i cant find commander tucker
has anyone opened either of the ventral hatches
not since we sealed them
you mustve missed him
ill look again
four five six seven
all right does it have an id tag
junction four one alpha atmospheric
recycling manifold
good do you see the releases on either side
yes there are four of them
two blue
two silver
open them the silver ones first
done
now pull the panel off
what should i do with it
whatever you want
lay it down on the floor
very well
right where you said it was captain
find the control panel
its right here it has six green lights
each of them should have a switch next to it
about five centimetres to the left
now before we can release the gas into central ventilation youre going to have to reroute the transfer lines to the carbon dioxide tanks
and how do i go about doing that
those six switches control the feed youre going to have to recalibrate them in sequence for co2
ill guide you through it
commander ive been looking all over for you are you all right sir
im fine
the captain asked me to find you he needs you in the command compartment commander
you cant go out there sir its not safe
what are you doing
ive reached the access tube captain
good now pull off the panel
its not coming off
itll come off you just need to use a little muscle
ive used every muscle ive got it wont budge
try using your foot
for leverage
good suggestion
okay
now the next parts a piece of cake
weve got a problem captain
stand by doc what happened
commander tucker he just went out the forward hatch
what
i tried to stop him sir he didnt look like himself i think one of those things got inside him
if he knows what were doing
were going to have to speed things up doc trips been taken he left the catwalk a few minutes ago
if he tries to let his buddies out of their quarters we dont have any guards down there to stop him
tell me what to do
youll have to purge the osmotic filters
the valves are right behind the control circuit youre going to have to get two fingers through the upper holes in the support plate
normally that wouldnt be a problem but wearing those gloves
could make it difficult
back home im known for my fine motor skills i doubt a pair of ev gloves
will deter me
there are two solenoids behind the openings when you tap them simultaneously the plate should retract
did you say there were two
about three centimetres apart
got it
you should be looking at two rotary valves and a lever
i see them
open both valves all the way then turn the lever to the three oclock position that should do it
tpol the nine oclock position will vent the gas when were finished
phlox to captain archer
go ahead
mission accomplished
im monitoring commander tucker
good job
its left commander tucker
vent the gas
in a moment captain i need to be certain the co2 levels are consistent throughout the ship that all the lifeforms are gone
ready travis
yes sir
its done
full impulse
theyre in pursuit
stand by now
whats going on doc
just breathe deeply youll be fine
i was just at a barbecue
in through the nose out through the mouth
ive never seen so many ribs
follow me commander we have a lot of doors to unlock
bring in the prisoner
you stand accused of conspiring against the klingon empire how do you respond
im not guilty
when this tribunal convenes tomorrow you will be given a chance to prove your innocence if you cannot there is only one punishment
you have five minutes
glad you could drop by
how are you
ive been better
i wasnt sure if id find you alive
they promised me a trial before the execution
something wrong
xenopolycythemia can be highly contagious im surprised they havent put you in isolation
any residual symptoms fever dizziness
just a scratchy throat
lets have a look
when did you get here
two days ago but they refused to let us see you
enemies of the state arent allowed visitors
tpol was finally able to convince them that your condition necessitated a visit from your doctor
very thoughtful of her
she sends her regards and she wanted me to assure you that starfleet and the vulcan high command are doing everything possible to get you released
are they having any luck
not yet but she and commander tucker have begun exploring other options for regaining your freedom
when this is over whatever the outcome im counting on them to get enterprise safely out of klingon territory
ill let them know how are your accommodations
not so bad cant say im a big fan of klingon cuisine
it may not appear appetising but it seems like a good source of protein i suggest you eat it
is he infectious
i dont believe so
then return to your ship
id like to run some more tests
youre not here to treat him
thanks for the house call doc
im sure ill see you soon
im kolos your advocate
jonathan archer
the tribunals about to begin
we havent even discussed what happened
im familiar with the charges
well im not familiar with your justice system what can i expect out there
now that youve been charged the evidence against you will be presented
do i get a chance to testify
i will conduct your defence
how can you do that when you havent heard what really happened
i know what happened you mustnt speak during the tribunal ill speak for you
what are they saying
enemy
i hope theyre not the jury
there is no jury
whos that
prosecutor orak his success is well known
what about you whats your success rate
ive performed my duty
this tribunal is convened strength to the empire prosecutor orak you may proceed
i call duras son of toral
captain duras tell the tribunal about your encounter with the accused
i am no longer a captain
explain
i am a second weapons officer serving on the tygokor defence perimeter
the duras i called to testify is commander of the battle cruiser bortas
i was recently reduced in rank
a distinguished klingon warrior stripped of his command did the accused have anything to do with your disgrace
yes
go on weapons officer duras
a group of rebels had fled the klingon protectorate at raatooras i was commanded to bring these traitors to justice wed followed their warp trail to a system just outside klingon territory
theyre near the fifth planet another vessel is docked with them
show me  what kind of ship is that
unknown but theyve taken the rebels aboard
armaments
torpedo launchers fore and aft lowyield particle cannons we can defeat them easily
intercept
theyre signalling us
viewer identify yourself
captain archer of the battle cruiser enterprise
the people aboard your ship are wanted for treason surrender them immediately
by whose authority
the chancellor of the klingon high council
i dont know your chancellor and i dont give a damn what he wants ive formed an alliance with these people and im going to support their revolt
give them to me now or ill destroy your vessel
fire one shot and youll be joining your ancestors in the afterlife
he refused to surrender the rebels
yes
i didnt say any of those things cant you object
its not important
and how did you respond to archers defiance
i pitied him he was about to die in defence of these wretched traitors
they werent traitors
advocate havent you informed the prisoner of the rules of this tribunal
my apologies magistrate be silent or you will be removed
continue
i showed him more patience than he deserved but obviously he wanted blood to be spilt
dont be a fool your ship is inferior you wont survive a battle with us
death to the empire
return fire
theyre heading for the ring system
the coward thinks he can hide pursue them
where are they answer me
debris is interfering with sensors
there target their engines all weapons
weve lost sensors shields are down
manual targeting fire
theyre leaving orbit
follow them
our engines are down
it took us three hours to repair our warp drive
but of course by that time they were gone youre fortunate your first officer didnt kill you for such a failure youre dismissed
youre not going to question him
hed say nothing that would help you
do you have any further evidence to present
no magistrate duras testimony is clear he was attempting to carry out his mission to bring enemies of the empire to justice but this aggressor this human conspired with them to disgrace a proud warrior and foment rebellion there can be no doubt that he is our enemy as well captain archer claims to be innocent innocent of what this tribunal has already been far too lenient we havent accused his crew or his government hes fortunate we havent dispatched a fleet of warships to his homeworld but we do demand that he be held responsible for the crimes he has committed we demand that he receive the most severe punishment our laws decree
do you have a response
no magistrate
then i will consider the evidence and deliver my verdict
id like a chance to defend myself
you have been warned
hes distorting the truth
be silent
those people werent rebels and i wasnt trying to start a rebellion i am not your enemy
this tribunal is in recess
what is this
targ
its a little underdone
i told you to remain silent you should have listened to me
sorry if i interfered with your legal strategy
my strategy may yet spare your life ive spoken with the magistrate hes willing to show you mercy if you cooperate
how
tell him where to find the rebels
i told you theyre not rebels
it doesnt matter what you believe theyre subject to the laws of the empire theres nothing you can say that will change that
i havent been able to say anything
where did you take them another ship a planet do you understand what will happen if you dont tell them
ive a pretty good idea
im offering you a way to save your life
lets say i did cooperate what would happen to these people
they would be charged with treason
and end up in a court like this one tell the magistrate im going to pass on his offer
only a fool would sacrifice himself for people he barely knows
i know them well enough theyre good people and i wont turn them over if youd let me testify tell my side of the story it might become clear why i helped them but from what ive seen youre all perfectly happy to ignore what you dont want to hear
dont be so quick to accuse me of sharing their interpretation of the law
no whats your interpretation
i became an advocate many years ago they were different times
better or worse
the courts were more willing to listen
then maybe you should remind them of those different times nothing like a good history lesson
im an old man too old to challenge the rules
even if your clients life depends on it i get the feeling youre as frustrated as i am that you want to stand up to them but youve given up youre afraid of them
im not afraid
then prove it challenge them show them what a real trial is like
strength to the empire have you informed the accused of our offer
i have
and does he wish to address this tribunal
he does he wishes to testify in his own defence
i object the time for testimony is over
with respect magistrate no verdict has been reached
irrelevant i urge you to end these proceedings
i am within my rights to present further testimony
youre speaking of archaic rights
surely i dont need to remind the magistrate the judicial charter of koloth states an advocate is entitled to challenge the charges at any point during the tribunal to my knowledge that charter has not been cast aside from the time of kahless our courts have stood as a forum where justice is dispensed with honour now will my case be heard or will it not
call your witness
identify yourself
im captain jonathan archer of the earth starship enterprise
do you admit captain archer that you gave aid and comfort to a vessel fleeing the empire
we answered a distress call they were starving their life support was failing
their health isnt at issue here you helped them to escape
will my client be allowed to testify or not
prosecutor you will show the advocate the same respect he has shown you continue
recount for this tribunal your recollection of the events
as i said we had received a distress call
magnify biosigns
twenty seven
any response
no sir
malcolm
main propulsions offline life support is failing theyre in a bad way sir
can you dock with them
their port engine is venting reactor coolant i can try to come in on the starboard side but itll be tricky
do your best
our warp drive failed three weeks after we left we tried to set a course for the nearest system at impulse but main power went down
how long ago was that
i dont know six weeks maybe more we diverted auxiliary power to life support but it wasnt enough food processors failed water recyclers
ive put them all on protein supplements but two of them are in serious condition
when we left there were fifty four aboard
what brought you out here
several years ago our colony was annexed by a species we had never seen before they said theyd provide for us in exchange for our allegiance that wed become a part of their empire but they stripped us of our resources left us with nothing we waited for them to return they said theyd bring food fuel they never came back
you knew they were fleeing the empire
we knew that their colony had been abandoned
and you chose to show them compassion
they were starving they wouldnt have lasted another week
they were subjects of the empire their welfare was not your concern
apparently it wasnt yours either
you see the contempt these humans have for us he still believes he did nothing wrong
and prosecutor orak has yet to prove that he has
he aided these rebels and now he refuses to help us bring them to justice
i will hear what the accused has to say
continue
my chief engineer had determined that their vessel was beyond repair
some of the crew will have to double up but i think we can accommodate all of them
ive already given the order considering the alternative was to set the ship adrift i anticipated your decision where do you plan to take them
they were headed for a system a few light years from here that should keep them safe from the klingons
empires tend to expand they may eventually discover they havent travelled far enough
captain please report to the bridge
looks like they didnt abandon the colonists after all
perhaps theyre bringing the supplies they promised
its a d5 battle cruiser i doubt its bringing supplies
how long before they get here
seventeen minutes
are all the refugees aboard
yes sir
cut their ship loose and go to tactical alert
so you were preparing for battle
i was preparing to defend my ship
as any good klingon commander would be
the accused has already admitted that he knew the rebels were subjects of the empire
they may have been subjects of the empire but it sure as hell looked like you had abandoned them
and he knew the bortas was coming to retrieve them yet he launched a deliberate attack against an imperial vessel this human is guilty of more than inciting rebellion he has committed an act of war
i dont suppose theres any chance of outrunning them
their maximum speed is warp six
if we could disable their engines
sustained fire from our phasecannons should be able to penetrate their armour but i doubt theyd sit still long enough to give us the chance
whats the composition of those rings
nothing unusual methane ice isolytic plasma diamagnetic dust
when we pulled that klingon ship out of the gas giant did you get a look at their sensor array
pretty standard multispectral sensors not too different from ours
if we could ignite the plasma in those rings would it disrupt their sensors
for a few seconds
a few seconds will have to do can you modify a torpedo
i believe so
how long
how long do i have
the klingon ship will be here in less than eleven minutes
get moving
so youve laid a trap for the bortas
we had no intention of firing first
such a noble human
i was assured the accused would be allowed to speak without interruption
by all means i find his version of events extremely entertaining
the bortas had dropped out of warp with their weapons charged
theyre on intercept course two hundred thousand kilometres and closing
hail them
identify yourself
im jonathan archer captain of the starship enterprise
youre harbouring fugitives surrender them
i wasnt aware theyd committed any crime
theyre wanted for inciting rebellion
from what i can tell they are in no condition to incite anything apparently their colony was abandoned by
turn over the rebels now
what do you intend to do with them
thats none of your concern
im sorry but im not prepared to hand them over without a little more information if i could speak to someone in your government
i speak for the empire
fair enough lets sit down and try to
hull platings at eighty percent no damage to the klingon ship
head into the rings
theyre pursuing ten thousand metres
were approaching a large fragment six hundred metres in diameter bearing two two seven mark four
put us behind it
theyre closing sir four thousand metres
stand by
three thousand metres two thousand eight hundred metres
fire
our sensors are down
lets hope theirs are too get us out of here
you say the bortas fired first
yes
and you tried to reach an accommodation with captain duras
he refused
duras was under no obligation to accommodate this human
so you were simply defending your ship when you attacked the bortas
yes
and then what happened
we left the system and took the refugees with us
you could have destroyed the bortas why didnt you
because captain duras is not my enemy
not your enemy i submit to this tribunal that captain archer is guilty guilty of meddling in klingon affairs on more than one occasion in fact ive discovered his name is well known to the high council the accused once stood before the chancellor himself and exposed a suliban plot that would have thrown the empire into civil war
that is absurd
the facts are on record perhaps the prosecutor has grown complacent with his research the records of the imperial fleet also mention this man his ship was instrumental in the rescue of the klingon raptor the somraw from the dense atmosphere of a gas giant
even if this is true it has nothing to do with this case
it has everything to do with this case it shows a pattern in archers behaviour that was repeated in his encounter with captain duras yes he may be selfrighteous but his meddling has saved a klingon ship and perhaps the fate of the empire itself if captain archer is guilty he is guilty of nothing more than being a nuisance and hardly worth the attention of this tribunal and if he must be punished let the punishment fit that crime
how long should it take for a verdict
it usually doesnt take long at all i must have been more persuasive than i thought
thanks for what youve done for me
dont thank me yet the odds are still very much against us
what is it
bloodwine it should help make the wait more pleasant
whats it the blood of
dont feel badly if you cant stomach it
i didnt say that
how many cases have you won
oh im not sure over two hundred but that was a long time ago when the tribunal was a forum for the truth and not a tool for the warrior class
there are other classes
you didnt believe all klingons were soldiers
i guess i did
my father was a teacher my mother a biologist at the university they encouraged me to take up the law now all young people want to do is take up weapons as soon as they can hold them theyre told theres honour in victory any victory what honour is there in a victory over a weaker opponent had duras destroyed that ship he would have been lauded as a hero of the empire for murdering helpless refugees we were a great society not so long ago when honour was earned through integrity and acts of true courage not senseless bloodshed
for thousands of years my people had similar problems we fought three world wars that almost destroyed us whole generations were nearly wiped out
what changed
a few courageous people began to realise they could make a difference
i have weighed the evidence carefully advocate kolos has made an impressive case much to the surprise of this tribunal based upon his arguments i am inclined to believe that the accused was a victim of his own foolishness he was not fomenting rebellion but as prosecutor orak has made clear the laws of the empire have been violated and captain archer must be held accountable for his actions regardless of his intent i therefore find the accused guilty as charged  however however this tribunal cannot ignore his actions assisting the klingon people therefore the sentence of death is commuted silence jonathan archer you are condemned to the dilithium mines on the penal colony of rura pente for the remainder of your life remove the prisoner
i protest
i wouldnt protest too loudly prosecutor youve won your case
and i compliment the magistrate on his just ruling but the sentence for these crimes must be death
the sentence is death you condemn this man to rura pente what is the life expectancy of a prisoner there six months a year at the most and you expect us to believe that this is an act of mercy
this court has shown you a great deal of patience advocate dont test my limits any further
i ask for no special treatment only that my client be judged fairly as any klingon would be judged but it has been many years since anyone stood in this chamber and received justice
watch your words you insult the honour of this tribunal
honour you acknowledged that captain archer acted with conviction and integrity and how do you reward him with this grand public display of compassion before sending him to his death in a frozen cave
enough
forgive me if i fail to see the honour in that
you are in contempt of this tribunal since you have such admiration for the prisoner you will join him on rura pente for a period of one year remove them both
the vulcan high command will continue to lobby for the captains release
so what do we do
the klingons have only allowed us to remain here during the trial were to leave immediately
and abandon the captain
we dont have a choice
whats this rura pente like
its quite inhospitable
theyre going to have to get there
were deep inside klingon territory a rescue attempt is out of the question
im willing to risk it
the captain isnt he made it clear he didnt want us to endanger the crew on his behalf
so youre saying we just forget about him
im saying a rescue isnt an option but there are diplomatic channels
we tried diplomatic channels
not all of them ive dealt with several klingon bureaucrats in the past some of them can be persuaded mister mayweather take us out of orbit
you get back to work
you all right
perhaps i spent too much time in the law library and not enough in the battlefield
not all klingons are warriors remember
our ships run on dilithium not talk
leave him alone
get back to work
anymore trouble from you and youll spend the night on the surface
youre a fool
youre welcome
havent you learned your lesson this is why you were sent here in the first place for interfering in affairs that have nothing to do with you
we have a saying on earth you dont kick a man when hes down
so are all humans like this
like what fair
stupid
its in our nature
stand up we have work to do unless you want to sleep on the surface
follow me this way
new arrivals
prosecutor orak has been busy
stay away from us we have nothing you want
captain
its all right hes from my ship
its good to see you sir
you too lieutenant reed this is kolos my advocate
pleasure
howd you get here
tpol knows a few klingon officials from her days in the ministry of security one of them put us in touch with a corrections officer who was willing to look the other way for the right price i came on one of the dilithium barges we bribed the captain to bring us here and take us back to enterprise
is there room for one more
i imagine so but we have to hurry
come on
i cant go with you
why not
ive been an advocate for fifty years and i spent the last twenty of them standing in that tribunal playing my part holding my tongue and all the while honourable men were being sent to places like this without the benefit of a defence and then i was assigned your case you told me that on your world a few courageous people made a difference im not sure i have the courage but i know ill never be able to restore honour to my people living as a fugitive
you realise what that means you said most prisoners here dont survive a year
most prisoners here have very little to live for
captain
go go
thank you
bridge to mayweather
mayweather
im on my way
the planets orbit has shifted taking it between two gas giants their gravitational pull is causing its core to superheat
starfleet thinks it will be covered with erupting volcanoes by the end of the week
this systems almost thirty light years behind us
admiral forrest assures me its only a temporary detour
some geologic fireworks could be fun
set a course
aye sir
come in
do you have a minute sir
several actually please whats on your mind
i was wondering if i could make a personal request
of course
my familys ship the horizon were going to be passing close to it i wouldnt mind going by for a visit its about ten hours off our flight path enterprise can still get to the planet with time to spare you could pick me up on the way back
i think we can manage without you for a few days
thank you sir
your folksll be surprised to see you
my fathers been ill for a few months
nothing serious i hope
my mother said hell be fine shes the ships medic
i thought you told me your mother was the chief engineer
shes both
i guess they have to wear a lot of hats to keep those old ships running
my grandfather held the record five jobs at one time two of them on the bridge
there was a time when i gave serious thought to serving on a cargo ship
you sir
it was a few years before starfleet was chartered
why didnt you sign up
long story ill tell you the next time we have breakfast after we dock ill have phlox go over with you have him take a look at your father
id appreciate that sir
youll be glad to hear the thermal scanners are up and running
and the imaging relays
yep well drop six of them in high orbit that should give us a birdseye view of every volcano on the planet you know theres not going to be a lot to do once we get there sensors will record everything automatically
you should have plenty of time to practice your harmonica
ive talked chef into doing something special starting tuesday its going to be movie night every night thought you might be interested seeing how you enjoyed that western were going to be showing the three greatest horror movies ever made frankenstein bride of frankenstein and son of frankenstein we might even throw in abbott and costello meet frankenstein
i have no interest in horror movies
how do you know if youve never seen one you dont have to see all of them just come the first night i promise youll like it reanimated life forms science run amok theyre right up your alley
four years isnt so long my last family reunion was almost a decade ago
starfleet really ought to think about putting families on starships
you must be joking
no one would ever get homesick
yes well theyd better post a psychologist onboard because id need one if my parents were roaming the corridors
on a cargo ship you cant walk ten metres without running into your babysitter or a greataunt
bridge to ensign mayweather
go ahead
weve gotten a response from the horizon its your mother
thanks hoshi put it through to my quarters
mind if i join you
of course not
i havent been up here since we launched come here a lot
every now and then
commander tucker told me what happened im sorry
my mother sent a message to starfleet six weeks ago but i never got it
the civilian channels can be pretty slow
i should have called him we were in comm range a few months ago i guess i wasnt ready to talk to him yet he wasnt very happy with me when i joined starfleet hed been grooming me for his job since i was kid
im sure it wasnt easy for him when you left but i know for a fact that he was proud of you
with all respect sir im not so sure he was
did he ever tell you about the letter he sent me it was almost two and a half years ago there were a few candidates i was looking at for helm officer i was having a little trouble deciding so i contacted their former cos hoping for a more personal evaluation
what did he say
he wrote the shortest recommendation just one sentence he said hed never met a more natural stick and rudder man in his life and id be a fool if i didnt choose you when i saw how you handled yourself at the helm i knew he was right
i wish he would have told me that
as i suspected its nothing more than a simple headache
i was hoping for something more serious
oh
ive been coerced into watching tonights movie
if youre looking for a medical excuse im afraid youre out of luck if its any consolation ill be there as well i agree this form of entertainment is rather crude but it can often provide an enlightening glimpse into human behaviour
dont be surprised if you see me here again afterwards i have little doubt my headache will return
just a quick tour of the engine room thats all im asking
the horizons fifty years old im sure youve seen far more impressive warp reactors
zephram cochrane designed that engine himself ive heard rumours that he personally signed the inside of each reactor casing oh almost forgot
whats this
a few family photos i downloaded every picture ive taken since we left spacedock thought your mom might like to see what her boys been up to
thank you sir
you bet
i wouldnt call it a dangerous mission weve gotten into a few skirmishes but nothing we couldnt handle
i got a letter from your sister she said you mentioned a close call with some kind of storm
we ran into a small wavefront a few months ago the crew had to squeeze into one of the nacelles for a couple of days she probably made it sound worse than it was
she also mentioned something about alien soldiers forcing their way aboard
it was really just a misunderstanding they thought enterprise had been abandoned captain archer convinced them to leave
i guess theres no point in asking you about the romulan minefield
howd you know about that
ive been serving on cargo ships for a long time ive made a few contacts here and there
stand by to go to warp
charlie must be at the helm
what makes you say that
his warp jumps were always a little rough where are we headed
deneva station just a quick run to pick up supplies well have you back in plenty of time
watch your step maam travis
hey
havent seen you for a while did you lock yourself in a cargo container again
do you always have to bring that up
its good to see you if youre not busy tonight stop by the mess
i will
did you forget your way
guest quarters are over here
youre not assigned to guest quarters
i thought my room had been reassigned
it was but they didnt mind giving it up for a few days we dont get vips very often i found some of your old things thought you might feel more at home
i cant believe you kept this
you stayed up all night for a month mapping every system you planned to visit when you grew up
ive still got a ways to go
im glad youre home
me too  were going to get through this mom
those plasma injectors arent going to align themselves i should go after youve settled in come by the engine room some people want to say hello
transfer these canisters over to module four
are you sure youre old enough to drive that thing
an ensign ought to salute before addressing a captain
acting captain dont let it go to your head
ill catch up with you in a few minutes
the jacket looks good on you
thanks didnt think id be wearing it this soon
business must be good ive never seen this module so full
the biggest problem these days is keeping track of everything dad kept a lot of the inventory in his head im trying to reconstruct the database we still cant find the stromatopod larvae were supposed to be delivering to the demerians i only hope they didnt end up in cold storage
if you need me to help out with anything
thanks but we can handle it youre on leave im not going to put you to work
see you at dinner
travis you might want to change into something a little less conspicuous
ive deployed the imaging relays
how long until the show begins
approximately thirty hours the holometric camera still need to be calibrated
i can help with that
get started id like to share our pictures with starfleet give admiral forrest a frontrow seat
echo threes within range it shouldnt be too hard to set up a downlink
so you coming tonight
if the sensors are calibrated by then
well youd better make up your mind seats are going to fill up fast
according to the database frankenstein is also a work of literature
mary shelley wrote it the wife of a famous poet
perhaps a dramatic reading would be more illuminating
you expect a mess hall full of crewmen to sit still while someone reads to them
theyd be more likely to appreciate the authors true intent
you want to start a book club go right ahead youre going to be there tonight arent you sir
wouldnt miss it
ill save you some popcorn
might be a good idea for you to go too it might be fun and a little fraternising couldnt hurt
i dont understand how sitting silently in a darkened room constitutes fraternising
its a communal experience tell you what lets make a night of it dinner in the captains mess eighteen hundred movie at nineteen thirty youll be my date
i beg your pardon
ill be a perfect gentleman and if you dont like the movie ill never ask you to sit through another one
all right try it now  ive increased the range of the navigation sensors the helm will make course corrections a lot quicker
whats wrong
im just working on a few upgrades
i dont remember asking for any upgrades
you were busy i didnt want to bother you youre going to love this you know those port stabilisers that were always acting up before i left i spoke with commander tucker
commander tucker
our chief engineer on enterprise he showed me how to reconfigure the spatial discriminators shouldnt give you any more trouble
whats going to happen if these improvements of yours go offline youll be back on your starfleet ship out of comm range whos going to fix it id prefer it if you didnt modify any more systems without discussing it with me
whatever you say sir
maybe you can stop by engineering build us a warp five engine
come in
i heard we had a visitor
word travels fast
i still cant believe hes gone im so sorry travis
thanks
arent you a little old for this
i dont know i thought it might be fun to regress for a while what do you say we turn off the gravplating and jump on the bed
and get grounded again that wouldnt look too good on your starfleet record hows enterprise
keeps us busy weve gone a hundred and fifty light years seen twenty two inhabited worlds
in eighteen months
you cant believe whats out there
columbus magellan travis mayweather how long are you home for
just a few days
any chance of getting an extended leave
im afraid not i doubt magellan got much time off either whats wrong
i dont mean to spoil your visit but things havent exactly been running like clockwork since your father died
what do you mean
we missed a rendezvous with an orion freighter two weeks ago the cargo authority wasnt too pleased were also low on deuterium weve had to dip into the reserves twice this month morales been better travis horizons lost its captain and some of the crew are starting to wonder if pauls ready for the job you might have noticed hes been a little on edge
hes always on edge
more than usual
my mother hasnt mentioned any of this
i guess she didnt want to worry you
hes only been in command a few weeks give him a chance hell grow into it
i hope youre right im sure this is the last thing you wanted to hear right now but i thought you should know
thanks
charlie at the helm
just a little spatial turbulence youve gotten spoiled on enterprise
thats no turbulence
hull fracture in module three were venting atmosphere
seal it off try hailing them again
theyre still not responding
whats going on
were under attack
by who
i dont know
should i arm the plasma turrets
no transfer reserve power to the hull plating we need to get out of their weapons range go to maximum warp
youre hauling thirty thousand metric tons youre not going to be able to outrun them
you heard me
yes sir warp one point six one point seven warp one point eight
theyre still closing
a little more
one point eight five
theyre moving off
reduce speed to one point five
they attached something to the hull
show me
its emitting a subspace signal could be some kind of beacon
call engineering tell them to get someone out there to pry it off
i wouldnt recommend that this is a dicobalt signature a highyield explosive if anyone gets too close it might decide to go off
the constellation sent us this this ship attacked them eight weeks ago and it planted a beacon on their hull a day later this cruiser showed up and demanded their cargo the constellation tried to drive them off but the aliens got aboard and killed three of their crew then they took the entire shipment
what kind of weapons does the constellation have
two plasma turrets same as us
there has to be a way to remove that beacon
i wouldnt risk it if it detonates you could lose the nacelle
if we jettison a few tons of that ore can we increase to warp two
i dont see why not
that should allow us to reach deneva station ahead of schedule its wellarmed we should be safe there
what happens if they come back before we arrive
theres no other choice we cant shoot our way out of this
ive seen this kind of engine configuration before its not that different from a mazarite ship
mazarite
we had some trouble with them we managed to knock out their engines with our phase cannons
we dont have phase cannons
i can tie the plasma turrets directly into the impulse engines lieutenant reed did that and it increased our yield by eighty percent
im not going to risk all of our lives by getting into a fight we cant win if they reach us before we make it to deneva well give them what they want
if theres one thing ive learned from captain archer its that you dont give in to people like this youre only going to encourage more attacks not just against you but other cargo ships
i appreciate the advice but this isnt your problem youre not part of this crew anymore jettison that ore and increase our speed
even your father had to make compromises the safest thing to do is give them what they want cargo can be replaced
 fool if this storm develops as i hope youll have plenty to be afraid of before the nights over go on fix the electrodes this storm will be magnificent all the electrical secrets of heaven this time were ready eh fritz ready
what are you doing
im reviewing this mornings sensor data
i thought you were going to give this a chance
just a few stitches and look heres the final touch a brain you stole fritz think of it the brain of a dead man
this doctor frankenstein his technique is not dissimilar to a practice on bsaari two they successfully used an isolytic current to reanimate the bodies of the recently deceased
really
of course the revived individuals werent capable of more than basic cellular metabolism however the bsaari have developed a procedure that shows promise in repairing the synaptic
we can stop the film if its disturbing your conversation
in fifteen minutes the storm should be at its height
then well be ready whats that noise
captain looks like someones rerouting the impulse relays
where
module five
you have the bridge
i thought i made myself clear
if those aliens come back youll thank me
i told you im not going to take this ship into battle
you may not have a choice
i didnt ask for your opinion and i didnt approve your modifications stop what youre doing
paul
you heard me
i didnt mean to undermine your authority
really
but youre being unreasonable i just want us to be prepared
us you keep talking as if youre a part of this crew
its still my home
you turned your back on us a long time ago
is that what this is about me leaving if you want to be an effective captain youve got to set your personal feelings aside listen to what other people have to say
more words of wisdom from starfleet
no your father he said that to me a long time ago if he was here now hed tell you the same thing
you quoting dad you never listened to him if you had you wouldnt have abandoned your family you barely spoke to him for the last four years you werent even here when he died
that isnt fair
you knew he was sick but you didnt really care you only decided to stop by because it was convenient for you hostile aliens arent our problem its starfleet and people like you do you have any idea how hard it is to find new crewmen no one wants to run freight anymore they all want to be explorers cruising around on state of the art ships with their personal chefs
you want to stand around feeling sorry for yourself go ahead ive got better things to do
take those upgrades offline ill confine you to quarters if i have to
im just trying to help you paul in case you havent noticed you could use a little help right now
i dont want your help
you want to take them offline do it yourself
i understand you made a few modifications to the impulse relays next time you might want to check with me i am the chief engineer
i knew how paul would react i didnt want to drag you into it
ive played referee between you and your brother for a long time
never thought id actually miss these
nutripaks
not just any nutripak strawberry shortcake the first time i tasted real shortcake was in san francisco it just wasnt the same
i think theyve ruined your taste buds
i wouldnt mind eating like this again im thinking about asking for an extended leave im sure captain archer would approve considering
how long would you stay
as long as im needed
but youre needed on your ship
im not the only helm officer
even if your captain agrees it could be a long time before enterprise is back this way again
theres a lot for me to do here i can help upgrade the guidance and warp systems with a little luck we could make horizon the fastest jclass in the fleet
youre going to give up your career move back home and take orders from your brother
my careers the last thing on my mind right now
congratulations now you know what its like to be a parent i could spend every waking minute worrying about you two but id never get any work done
hes not ready mum
you shouldve seen your father when he took over he was a year younger than paul is now he was an engineer he didnt know the first thing about running a bridge we fell so far behind schedule he almost lost his eca license he wanted to quit i wouldnt let him your brother just needs some time
you dont think i should stay
didnt we have this conversation it was right here in this room four years ago when you first thought about joining starfleet
a lot has changed in four years mum
thats true and a lot mores going to change will we be talking about this again in another four years youre the helmsman of the first warp five starship im proud of you everyone here is even paul though he wont admit it if youll indulge a little motherly advice dont let your guilt over leaving guide your decision
ill try to keep that in mind good night
night
i find it hard to believe that no one on vulcans ever heard of a horror movie
there is something similar a discipline known as taruletek it uses disturbing imagery to provoke an emotional response
they try and scare you to see how well you suppress your emotions
i dont understand why humans would feel compelled to frighten themselves
gets the heart pumping
cardiovascular activity would be more efficient
you never did give us your opinion of the movie
there were many medical inaccuracies
what did you think of the story
i thought the protagonist was interesting
doctor frankenstein
no his creation from my perspective this was the story of an individual persecuted by humans because he was different
thats one way of looking at it
in many ways the film seemed quite prophetic the reaction of the villagers for example it was similar to the reception vulcans received after landing on earth
i dont recall anyone greeting a vulcan ambassador with torches and pitchforks
nevertheless many humans reacted with fear and anger
they didnt know what to expect
im going to recommend that ambassador soval watch the film
youre kidding
i believe it would help vulcans whove recently arrived on earth
maybe inviting her to movie night wasnt such a great idea
on the contrary im looking forward to bride of frankenstein
bridge to captain archer
go ahead
you might want to look out the window sir
thermal shear some of those eruptions are getting close to enterprise
take us up another five thousand kilometres
aye sir
captain im reading biosigns on the planet to quote doctor frankenstein its alive
i thought it was uninhabited
it appears that several microbial species which live underground are being unearthed by the volcanic activity
see what you can learn about them
full power to the hull plating
were being hailed
this is captain mayweather of the ecs horizon
prepare to surrender your vessel and evacuate the crew
ill give you our cargo but not our ship
you wont be harmed if you cooperate drop out of warp
were dozens of light years from our homeworld there has to be some compromise we can
theyre charging weapons
bring the weapon upgrades online still think you can disable their engines
if i can get a clear shot but i cant do that as long as theyre behind us
theyve hit module five
its going to be tough to manoeuvre with thirty kilotons of cargo weve got to cut it loose
engineering stand by to release the primary clamps
you do remember how to fly this ship
im sure itll come back to me
take us out of warp release the clamps
theyre closing forty metres thirty
just a few more clamps
ten metres
starboard platings down
travis
hull platings gone
im coming around again
their weapons are going down
keep our turrets locked on them open a channel this is captain mayweather id think twice before attacking any of our ships again redock with the cargo section then get us out of here
aye captain
come in
all packed
wouldnt want to wear out my welcome
i got a message from enterprise theyre running ahead of schedule well be docking in about twenty minutes
if you like ill speak with lieutenant reed im sure he can help you remove that alien beacon
thanks so did you ever make it to trelkis three
what
trelkis three the planet with the multicentric rings you used to talk about it when we were growing up
we havent travelled quite that far
when you do how about sending me a subspace postcard
you can count on it
well id better get back to the bridge see you in another four years
maybe sooner
id like that
welcome back
thank you sir
hows your family
theyre okay
we spotted some damage on their port cargo modules
probably an old meteorite impact
you sure everythings all right
never better sir
feeding time
when isnt it
what is that
it wont bite its called a tribble
it was extremely difficult to acquire theyre outlawed on most worlds
why is it dangerous
oh far from it all its capable of doing really is eating and breeding the problem is they breed quite prodigiously
the only thing that keeps their population in check is the abundance of reptiles on their homeworld are you feeling all right ensign
i just came by to give you this transmission its from the denobulan science academy marked urgent
thank you
these caverns go on for fifty kilometres
theyve mapped fifty kilometres no one knows exactly how far they extend
what were these scientists of yours doing down there
this cave system is known for its mineral formations the speleothems are supposed to be particularly unusual
theyve been underground for six months the denobulan science academy lost contact with them three weeks ago the planets called xantoras the governments been politically unstable for several years in the last few weeks a militant faction has taken control
theyre demanding that all offworlders leave anyone who fails to comply could face imprisonment or possibly worse
then why dont the denobulans evacuate their own scientists
they cant get here in time enterprise is less than a day away weve been asked to pick them up first we have to find them youve had some caving experience
there are some pretty steep inclines here but i think i can handle it
what about you and malcolm
dont worry captain im sure travis is an excellent teacher
get some gear together
aye sir
i realise this was an unusual request captain i want to thank you
happy to help doctor
pitons
all here
ration packs
a weeks worth
flexcable
five hundred metres
waste disposal units
what are these for
we take out everything we bring in
i just spoke to the xantoras regional governor hes issued a general order you have to get them out of there in three days
thats not much time
the militarys preparing search patrols to arrest any stray offworlders when the deadline arrives if you havent found them in a day and a half i want you to turn around and head back
no arguments here
whats the problem
one of the transports leaving the planet just declared an emergency
their reactor casings ruptured the captains asking the xantoras for permission to go back down
can you put it on speaker
several compartments have flooded with radiation i have injured passengers and crew
your request has been denied leave orbit immediately
our situation is critical
were tracking your vessel if you attempt to land we will commence
where are they
in a low orbit six hundred kilometres below us
set a course open a channel i want to speak to their captain
there could be internal bleeding run a haemostatic scan  treat these with dermalin gel and give him two ccs of anaprovaline for the pain youre going to be fine
he was working near the reactor when it ruptured
doctor
get him into the imaging chamber
what have you got
nothing but three humans one of which is not entirely convinced were going in the right direction
make that two
this is the nearest entrance to their campsite id be willing to bet they came this way
watch your footing theres a lot of loose rock
the last cave i was in had handrails a gift shop a snack bar
theres an opening over here
still willing to bet they came this way
yes sir
isnt there a beginners cliff we can start on
dont worry ill go first
hows it going
these two are doing well his injuries were more extensive his body absorbed a heavy dose of radiation ive stabilised him for now but hes going to need intracellular regeneration
what are his chances
its a complex procedure but id say the odds are in his favour
here am i
youre on my ship enterprise im captain archer
what happened
there was an accident on your transport
whats he doing here
hes our doctor
keep him away from me
you need his help
id rather die than be treated by him
our two species have a complicated history weve gone to war with the antarans on several occasions
recently
on the contrary its been three hundred years since our last conflict
and theres still bad blood between you
theyve been particularly bitter disputes
if you explain to him that he wont survive without your help maybe hed set the past aside for a few hours
i seriously doubt it he insisted i leave the room i dont think you realise how much bad blood there is
you could always sedate him and perform the treatment
i have to respect his wishes
even if he wishes to die
the will of the patient is the cornerstone of denobulan medical ethics
dont you believe if you can help someone your ethically bound to do so
hippocrates wasnt denobulan
this is an earth ship doctor i wont let that man die in my sickbay if it can be prevented
without his consent there is nothing i can do
im giving you an order
im sorry captain but im afraid i cant follow it
watch your footing sir
thanks
travis
stay calm commander are you all right
just testing the rope
why dont you take a break ill see whats below
hey whats that
i think its denobulan ive seen characters like these in phloxs medical books
you dont suppose denobulans carry out everything they bring in
rock samples
looks like were on the right track
how are you feeling
id like to return to my ship
your ship was damaged by the reactor leak itll be a few days before you can go back aboard you were exposed to high levels of radiation you need treatment
i prefer to be treated by another physician
if you dont let phlox operate you wont survive more than two days i understand theres a troubled history between your peoples but i can assure you phlox is an excellent doctor
our history is much more than troubled did your doctor tell you that their battle tactics resulted in twenty million antaran casualties
he wasnt that specific
i imagine not theyve been very successful at putting it behind them
do you want to become a casualty of a war that ended three hundred years ago phlox has been my chief medical officer for nearly two years ive never questioned his skill or his integrity
its quite possible hes a proficient surgeon but i dont intend to find out
youd rather die
im the first antaran to even see a denobulan in six generations
if you spent some time with him it might change your perception of them
a few hours in our historical archives might change yours
i prefer to make my judgments based on firsthand experience i respect your history and the sacrifice your people made but i can tell you that the denobulans youre describing are not the people ive met dont sacrifice your life based on preconceptions
why havent you ever mentioned this
do you know youre the first denobulan hes ever met
and he is the first antaran ive ever met
doesnt that seem odd to you that in three hundred years neither side has tried to reconcile maybe you put it behind you too quickly
as i said before the situation is complicated from childhood every antaran is taught that denobulans are enemies to be feared reviled
this is your chance to prove them wrong
i doubt i could
set aside your preconceptions i made some headway with him but i wont be the one holding the scalpel show him that he can trust you
do you believe i can earn his trust in less than thirty six hours
all im asking is that you try your ethics might keep you from treating him against his will but nothings stopping you from talking to him youre a doctor hes your patient find a way to help him
toss a coin
they went that way
how can you tell
well look at those
if i was a geologist thats the way id go
stay close to the wall
i dont have much choice its getting steeper
let me lock off check the safety commander
i cant reach it
almost
i cant hold this much longer
stand by well try again lets swing together you ready on three one two three
the ropes slipping
were all right
is it broken
yes you tore a couple of ligaments too
we need to keep moving just give me something for the pain
sorry travis youre not going anywhere
i can make it sir
were already behind schedule ensign we cant have you slowing us down thanks for getting us this far
youll be all right
respectfully sir its not me that im worried about
give me some light on this
what are you doing
checking your biosigns nothing else
very diligent what a dedicated healer you must be
youre a long way from home what brought you here
practicing your bedside manner
i enjoy a good challenge you havent answered my question
im a teacher of xenomythology i study the legends of alien species
well i imagine the diverse population on this planet made it ideal for your research enterprise is here to pick up three denobulan scientists they also found this world uniquely suited to their fieldwork
how delightful that we have so much in common why do you want to save my life
im a doctor
do you believe that saving one antaran will assuage your guilt for killing millions
i havent killed anyone
now you finally have your chance
i assure you the regeneration procedure is quite safe if youll allow me to proceed
you must know a great deal about our anatomy after what your doctors did to us
tell me were you raised listening to stories about my people the evil antarans did they give you nightmares
i could ask you the same question about my people
do you have children doctor
why
did you tell those stories to them did you teach them to hate antarans just like you were taught
my children have nothing to do with this
dont they if they were here right now what would they think about their father talking to an antaran
enough
would you even let them in the same room with me
i have tried to treat you with respect but i refuse to listen to these insults youre the reason we havent been able to put the past behind us you have kept this hatred alive no denobulan would want to be in the same room with you
may i join you
actually im not in the mood for company subcommander wait im sorry sit down
if you wish to be alone
sit please please how are the repairs to transport coming
slowly the damage was extensive how is your patient
dying but that seems to be his wish
thats unfortunate
ive had patients refuse treatment before but usually in the final stages of an illness but this man seems determined to die just to prove a point its painful to admit but i understand why when i was quite young i wanted to take a trip to an arboreal planet near our system it was a park of sorts with a great variety of exotic animal life some friends and i had planned the journey for months but the week before i was supposed to leave one of my grandmothers took me aside and told me i couldnt go
why not
she said the planet was tainted antarans had lived there once even though theyd been gone for years she believed the place had been spoiled by their presence
did you go
no but when i had children of my own i took them there i was determined not to raise them as i was raised
your children are fortunate to have a father who taught them to embrace other cultures
i certainly tried
are you all right
thanks for your company good night
can you see anything
more of the same
are you sure this is the way they came
i didnt see any other passage
well give it another half hour then were turning back
three biosigns denobulan
how far
about fifty metres
who are you
commander tucker of the starship enterprise this is lieutenant reed
i hope you wont think im rude but there are many other caverns here to explore
were not geologists
the denobulan science academy asked us to find you
why
the xantoras theyve given all the offworlders three days to leave and that was two days ago
then youd better hurry
you dont understand weve been ordered to take you out of here weve got a lot of hard climbing ahead of us so youd better decide how much of this gear you can do without
were sorry you came all this way but were not leaving
were not leaving without you
youve warned us about the situation commander youve accomplished your mission
not quite your science academy will hold us responsible if we come back alone
if the academy knew the progress we were making theyd never have sent you
you dont get it when the xantoras get their hands on you theyll throw you in prison they may even execute you
all the more reason for us to stay down here where were safe
you cant stay here forever
i doubt well need to the government changes hands so often everything will probably be cleared up by the time were finished
i realise your work is important but you cant risk your lives for these rocks
rocks this is the most remarkable collection of speleothems weve ever seen theres calcite aragonite botyroidal flowstone ive spent fourteen years searching for tractosites this perfect these samples can provide clues to prevent seismic disasters on denobula
how much longer do you need
two weeks maybe three
three weeks ive spent the last two days falling down cliffs and getting stuck in lava tubes all just to find you now ive got an injured man waiting for us and we have just enough time to get out of here before we end up in front of a xantoras firing squad my orders are to bring you back and i promise you thats what im going to do
you cant force us to leave
want to bet we didnt risk our lives to hear you say thanks but no thanks so pack up whatever you need because i swear ill tie you up and drag you out by your ankles if thats how you want it
we have a lot of samples well need your help
fine
id prefer to spend my last few days alone
thats your decision but if my knowledge of antaran lifespans is correct your last days wont come for about sixty years
what are you talking about
once the intracellular regeneration is complete you should be able to
i refused your treatment
i need to take you off the pain medication before i begin the procedure
get away from me i was told your principles prevented you from treating me against my will or dont your ethics apply to antarans
i did have nightmares
what
you asked me if i had heard stories as a child about the antarans my grandmother lived through the last war i would lay in my bed at night thinking about her stories terrified that one of those evil antarans would climb through my window
i hope your confession makes you feel better doctor but it doesnt change a thing
you also asked me if i have children i have five and no i never told them my grandmothers stories when they asked me about the antarans i told them the truth as best as i knew it i told them about our military campaigns against your people about how we had demonised you turned you into a faceless enemy i wanted them to learn to judge people for what they really are not what the propaganda tells them
how would you know who we really are
i dont but im proud to say that my children would consider my grandmothers attitude archaic all of them but one we have grown more openminded since the last war but there are still denobulans who fear antarans even hate them my youngest son mettus was seduced by those people i did my best to convince him he was mistaken i told him i wouldnt tolerate the values he was embracing it created a rift between us maybe i didnt do enough to reach him last time we spoke was nearly ten years ago you wanted to know what my children would think if they were here now i can tell you what mettus would think he would be happy to have me grant your request and let you die but that is not the example i tried to set for my children why not live and set an example for yours
whats wrong
nothing
then keep moving
whats the problem
i dont know come on lets go
i just need a moment
we dont have a moment what are you doing up there are those rock samples we cant carry any more
it took us six weeks to extract these from the rock bed
if you dont start moving in the next five seconds im going to take my phase pistol and shoot you in the ass
these are priceless
one two
go
could be some kind of seismic activity
feels like weapons fire to me pretty high yield by the sound of it
we still got two hours until the deadline  you better get your climbing gear on
we dont have any climbing gear
you mean to tell us that you climbed down that rock face without any ropes any safety equipment at all
exactly
well in that case after you
get against the wall
everyone all right
im fine
yes
lets keep moving before we get trapped down here
captain
is that the governor
he says his time is precious
so is mine
captain archer i thought i made myself clear
you did which makes me wonder why youre attacking my people
what do you mean
one of your patrols has opened fire in the vicinity of the caves your general order doesnt go into affect for another hour and a half
i assure you theyre not targeting your crewmen or the denobulans
then who are they shooting at
soldiers from the previous regime theyve refused to accept the shift in power
thats not my concern youre endangering my people youve got to wait until theyre in the clear
im afraid thats impossible
its what we agreed to
we agreed to give you three days nothing more
target the patrol thats firing at those caves
if you attack us well retaliate
were locked onto the coordinates
charge weapons
do you really want to be at war with us captain
the question is do you want to be at war with us it sounds like youve got your hands full already stick to our original agreement and you wont find yourself fighting on two fronts
commander the bombing seems to have stopped
we need to get out of here before it starts up again
you wanted to see me
what you said about your son you seem sincere in your desire to set an example for your children i wish more denobulans felt that way
many do perhaps if you met more of us
that seems unlikely
is that all you wanted to say to me
you made me think about my own family i have children as well ive decided to accept your treatment
my speleothems
forget about them
fortunately i have some other samples in my case
try them again
enterprise to commander tucker please respond
prep shuttlepod one have a security team meet me in the launch bay
the xantoras have mobilized their military patrols theyll detect a shuttle launch
noted
tucker to enterprise
youre cutting it pretty close trip the deadline passed two hours ago
better late than never
the denobulans
all aboard along with some very rare speleothems
captain theres a small craft closing on the shuttlepod its a patrol ship
youve got company trip
i see them bearing one eight four mark two seven
minimal damage theyre using lowpower particle beams
do you need assistance
stand by
i think theyre just trying to give us a little kick in the pants
how is he
hell be a bit groggy when he comes out of the anesthesia but the procedure was successful
im glad you didnt defy my orders i wasnt looking forward to throwing you in irons
neither was i
how did you convince him
you must be familiar with the principle of doctor patient confidentiality of course you could always order me to tell you
doctor phlox wanted to see you off but hes busy treating one of my crewmen who was injured on the surface
thats all right captain the doctor and i spent more than enough time together
its too bad your research on xantoras was cut short
the time i spent on your ship was an education in itself thank you for your help
you do know we came here to rescue three denobulan geologists
phlox told me
i understand theyll be heading home on your transport i hope that wont be a problem
have they been informed that ill be travelling with them
i had a talk with them
and what was their response
theyre willing if you are
computer begin recording dear mettus i know its been time since ive written and i know chances are slim that youll respond to this letter however something has happened that compels me to try to reach you again ive had an experience that has opened many old wounds as painful as its been its also changed something in me i hope if youre willing to listen it might begin to change something in you
its losing mass at an extraordinary rate
how long before it goes supernova
a hundred years maybe two
too bad we wont be around its going to be one hell of an explosion
speak for yourself i might very well be around
cant forget vulcan longevity captain a hundred years from now how old would that make you
no earth ship has ever been within ten light years of a hypergiant how much farther can we move in
our hull temperature is approaching eleven hundred degrees it would be unsafe to get any closer
then well have to run our scans from here tell astrometrics to get going im sure theyre champing at the bit
we may not be able to get any closer but someone else has
you found a ship
bearing two six one mark four they must be at least twenty thousand kilometres farther in than we are
lets see her
recognise it
no
hail them
the interference is pretty heavy sir
then try audio this is captain archer of the starship enterprise i assume youve detected us
captain drennik where have you travelled from
the sol system and you
we come from a system called vissia more than twenty five light years from here we saw you arrive yesterday i assume youre here to study the hypergiant
my species has never seen one up close
it is quite a sight have you measured its rate of nucleosynthesis
im afraid we havent developed the technology to do that
if you dont mind eliminating the development stage id be more than happy to help you modify your sensors
thank you im not sure we have anything to offer you in return
you could invite us to visit your ship meeting new species is one of our primary goals
its one of ours as well wed be honoured to have you join us for dinner
well be there within the hour i look forward to it
itll be nice to have a first contact where no ones thinking about charging weapons
tell chef were going to have some visitors
trinesium can withstand temperatures up to eighteen thousand degrees weve been using it to construct our hulls for over a century
you must be able to get down into the photosphere of most gtype stars
we can get even deeper with our stratopod its got twice the shielding
flying into stars is a long way off for us
your technology will evolve whats important is that youre explorers
we have gone farther than any other humans
you might enjoy going even farther im taking the stratopod into the hydrogen layer tomorrow id be pleased to have you join me
i am an explorer
this is called vanilla and this is chocolate give it a try
oh no wait youve got to eat the cherry first this
why
well you just do
a human tradition
exactly
arent you going to introduce me
this is malcolm reed our armoury officer this is traistana a xenobiologist and veylo is a tactical officer
very pleased to meet you
why dont you sit down the captain did ask us to mingle
indeed i was just speaking with their chief engineer and his wife maybe you should say hello
see you later
im told youre the chief engineer
commander tucker lieutenant reed pointed you out please sit down
thank you
this is my wife calla
im glad you invited us here
are you enjoying your food
oh very much
i hope you get the chance to sample our food its more fragrant than yours
i look forward to it id also like to get a peek at your engine room
by all means
trip tucker welcome aboard
hello
it has no name its our cogenitor
cogenitor
were hoping to have a baby
ah
our warp core emits omicron radiation id recommend you speak with your doctor about an inoculation
sure thing
this should do it
so youve heard of these cogenitors
not all species are limited to two sexes in fact i have it on good authority that the rigellians have four or was it five
so youre saying that this man or woman or whatever is a third sex
thats exactly what im saying
and she it is part of the impregnation process
precisely
im pretty familiar with how it works with two sexes but
multigendered techniques arent always the same but in this case i imagine the cogenitor provides an enzyme which facilitates conception
what do you mean by provides
well first the female has to
no no no dont tell me i dont think i want to know
oh well i have pictures
i think ill pass so how long is this going to last i might want to stay there for a while
it should protect you from omicron radiation for about twelve years
that should be enough thanks doc
keep an open mind commander you came on this mission to meet other species no matter how many genders they may have
there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy
whered you hear that
hamlet act one scene five your communications officer was kind enough to provide us with some of your literature i assumed you approved
absolutely but i didnt think youd be quoting it the next day
we retain most of what we read
and you obviously read pretty quickly
after i finished shakespeare last night i began reading the plays of sophocles what do you recommend after that
seems like youre picking the good ones all by yourself thats got to be ionised hydrogen
its generating magnetic currents
ive got friends back at home who are not going to believe this
i have friends wholl be equally impressed with macbeth were almost into the chromosphere
the antimatter stream is compressed before the deuteriums injected into the core
so you dont need magnetic confinement
let me bring up the schematics
where we come from earth there are only two genders
thats true of most worlds
i dont mean to pry but does every family have a cogenitor
that wouldnt be very efficient they are only needed when a couples trying to have a child
and when theyre not
the cogenitor is assigned to another couple they make up about three percent of our population which seems to be a perfect ratio nature has a way of finding the right balance
is the one i met the only one on your ship
the only one once calla and i are finished with it i doubt itll be needed before we return home would you like to take a closer look at the plasma converters
i would thanks so does it live with you and your wife
we keep it in our quarters yes
what does it do when youre not
it eats sleeps theres not much else for it to do
what about school
they only serve one purpose sending them to school would make no sense why are you so curious about them
humans are very curious
you might find this difficult to believe but this polymer is composed of over two hundred naturally occurring elements
thats impossible
i read in your database that youve discovered only ninety two i understand how this might seem unnerving
a lot of things around here do but im trying to keep an open mind
how long will you be gone
close to three days the circumference is nearly a billion kilometres well be scanning surface features that are undetectable from higher altitudes
three days is a long time to be confined to such a small craft especially with a person youve just met
i think ill survive these people are fascinating tpol they have a lot to offer us this could be the beginning of a beautiful relationship which reminds me theyve asked us for a sampling of films ive put together a few suggestions
ill see to it
youre in charge
of the ship or the movies
commander
captain left yet
hell be gone for three days
he asked that you download these films and transfer them to the vissians database
did you meet their engineer
briefly
he and his wife are trying to have a baby
how interesting
there was someone else with them they called her a cogenitor you know what that is
a third gender why do you call it her
well she looks more like a her than a him they treat her like a pet kept in her room not taught to read or write no name porthos has a name
its not our place to judge the customs of other cultures
were not talking about taking your shoes off when you walk into someones house this cogenitors treated like one of phloxs leeches you pull it out of its tank when you need it then you throw it back in
trigender reproduction is not uncommon
thats not what im talking about this is a question of human rights
theyre not human captain archer hopes to develop a productive relationship with this species it might be best you kept your opinions to yourself
its good advice mating habits are often quite personal some species arent comfortable discussing them
im not interested in discussing their habits im concerned with the way they treat this cogenitor
theyre most likely one and the same
yeah well that doesnt make it right
its not a question of right or wrong
you scanned them when they came on board dont you always do that
they werent carrying any pathogens that would be dangerous to our crew
is there anything you can tell me about the mental capacity of this cogenitor is it any different than the males and females
im afraid i didnt take any neural scans
is that something i could do
why would you want to
just curious
i suppose you could
fruit and cheese compliment each other
so cheese comes in eight varieties
actually there are hundreds maybe thousands
what made you choose these
they have the strongest smells of anything we have on board you said our food was aromatically bland i thought this might change your mind try some
mild but very nice
how about this one
the odour is a little spicier whats it called
stilton chef says its pretty pungent
havent you ever tried it
not for a long time
here
id say thats more than a little spicy
and whats this called
alsatian muenster
interesting
dont you find it sensual
very
can we visit the armoury later im anxious to see your tactical array
theres an old earth expression ill show you mine if you show me yours
your father thats hard to imagine the man who developed warp drive on my world lived nearly a thousand years ago
im surprised your ancestors never made it to earth
we dont believe in travelling great distances theres far too much to see close to home
well maybe now you have a reason to visit us its not that far
im sure we can make an exception im going to take us down to the edge of the photosphere it might get a little turbulent
fine with me
when the engine reaches critical mass a mixture of positrons and neutrinos is injected into the chamber watch
the efficiency is up over thirty percent pretty impressive
its possible this technology could be modified for enterprise
wed be very grateful we dont have any married couples on enterprise do they give you special quarters
the captains very generous
i wish ours was ive got a room not half the size of this one id love to get a look at your quarters sometime if i could describe it to captain archer he might consider expanding my living space
why dont you join us for dinner tonight you did agree to try our food
are you telling me you have a dining room
well try not to prepare anything too pungent
its pretty mild considering the smell
for us the aroma is far more important than the taste
this must have taken you all day
if i had all day i would have prepared a far more scented meal
callas in charge of the microgravity lab we usually dont have much time for cooking
will your cogenitor be joining us
it rarely eats more than one meal a day
oh so in our mess hall
bringing a cogenitor to your ship was an exception
too bad i was hoping to say hello
why would you want to do that
commander tucker is very curious about our reproductive process humans are bigendered
ill see if its awake
which ones the cogenitor
right here her synaptic density and neural mass are almost identical to the other two your cogenitor appears to be no more or less intelligent than the male and female
i wouldnt mind taking a turn at the helm
our navigation controls are not like yours theyre based on five spatial axes
ive been watching you i think i can handle it
you obviously have some experience
a little theres a pretty big flare forming below us i think i can loop around it let you get a better scan
its giving off a lot of magnetic flux it may cause false readings in the navigation sensors
ill keep an eye on it
so by rotating the quantum inverters youve tripled the antimatter flux
exactly three more and ill be finished
i havent eaten anything since this morning if you dont mind ill go to your mess hall see what theyre serving
if you wait until im done ill show you how to get there
ill be all right im sure i can find the way see you in a little while
theyre not here
i came to see you
why
i brought you this itll teach you how to read
now you try it
i dont understand
you just touch the word then youll hear it pronounced go ahead try it
today
thats right now go to the next one
today were
good again
why are you doing this its not right for me to read
who told you that
you shouldnt be here
youre as capable as they are as smart as they are
thats not true they need me to have children
its not a question of what they need you have the same rights to learn to choose how youre going to live to have a name
that may be true on your world but not on mine
when calla gives birth whos going to raise the baby whos going to take care of it
they will
why youre just as crucial in creating the child as they are
you dont understand
okay maybe but we took scans my doctor says you have the same potential as they do the only thing that sets you apart is your gender youre no more different than they are from each other havent you ever wished you could read it wont hurt you you know theres nothing to be afraid of
today were going today were going to today were going to read
im starting to get the hang of this i could take us down a little closer if youd like
another ten thousand metres and ill be able to get a particle count of the photosphere
aye aye captain ten thousand metres it is
are you all right
absolutely
if you can keep us at this altitude a little while longer
no problem
are these armed with photonic warheads
photonic im not familiar with that
im afraid our weapons are somewhat more sophisticated than yours
this technology must seem pretty antiquated to you
where i come from antiquated can be very quaint
is that how you see us quaint
and charming what sort of power source do these use
sarium microcells i suppose thats very quaint too
not at all we charge our weapons the same way
maybe youd like to see the phasecannon assembly
please
after you
it has multiphasic emitters and a maximum yield of eighty gigajoules
impressive
im sorry its so cramped in here
dont be ive wanted to get a little closer to you all day
really
i was hoping to spend some intimate time with you maybe we could sleep together tonight
on earth its customary to ask a woman to dinner first before spending the night with her
its very different on vissia its only when a woman enjoys her intimate time with a man that shell join him for dinner
the didiron mountain range runs through the upper plains of the great continent
amazing
the text describes far more impressive peaks
i dont mean the mountains i mean your reading
the fauna and flora vary greatly on either side of the central plateau
look how much youve accomplished in a single day and readings just the tip of the iceberg you could study all sorts of things history science engineerings not bad you dont have to sit in this room all day
they would never let me learn those things
then youve got to convince them its not just learning its experiencing things music swimming in the ocean you do have oceans on your planet
yes
and how about those didiron mountains reading about them is one thing climbing them is another
id like to climb a mountain
there you go thats the right attitude you keep at it ive got to get back they think im at the astrometrics lab but ill see you as soon as i can
trip
yeah
id like my name to be trip just like yours
actually my names charles
then i would like my name to be charles
im flattered
theres a flare forming ahead
i dont see it
you will turn the axis forty degrees to port i think we can bank around it
its too big
take us up try to get over it
were not going to make it
increase speed
it wont be enough
what are you doing
if you cant get over a wave you got to dive through it
where did you learn to do that
north shore of oahu body surfing i think its time you took the helm back
would you be punished if they find out youve brought me here
punished no but they might get a little angry
i would be punished
maybe i should take you back
no no i want to see more
okay well just have to be sure no one spots us  this is our transporter it turns things into a matter stream that can be sent just about anywhere within two thousand kilometres or so then it gets reassembled
could it send a vissian
i dont see why not
id like to try
i dont think that would be a good idea
could i see where you work
sure follow me
coast is clear thats our main engine fastest one in starfleet ive had it up to warp five point one
i think my ship has something like this but ive never seen it
your ship has an engine thats a lot more sophisticated than this one
do you live here
no my quarters are on b deck have you ever seen a movie
its not easy picking a movie for somebody whos never seen one before what would you think about a western no not a western i dont think a musical would be right either got it the day the earth stood still nothing like a little science fiction to break you in
its a story about your planet
yeah but its fiction the earth never really stood still sit down youre going to love this
why were the humans so afraid of klaatu and his android
well before we made first contact with the vulcans the people of earth were pretty violent they had a hard time trusting things they didnt understand the characters in the film knew nothing about klaatu who he was where he came from so they tried to kill him
i understand
does this mean ive won
no ones beaten me at this in the last two years
tell me about westerns maybe i could watch a western next
its getting late wed better get you back before they realise youre gone
ive been told youre no longer welcome aboard the vissian ship why
i wasnt exactly where i was supposed to be
no you werent you told them you were going to the astrometrics lab they tried to contact you but you werent there then they tried their mess hall you werent there either
i was with the cogenitor
where
at first in her quarters actually theyre not her quarters they belong to the chief engineer and his wife she gets a room to sleep in and if shes real good she can use their living space
why were you there
im teaching her how to read
her education is not your concern
what education
where else did you go
i brought her here gave her a little tour showed her a movie
it appears youre doing everything you can to undermine the captains wishes
one day thats all it took her in one day she was reading a geography text
first contacts are important to the captain you may very well have damaged this one irreparably
youre not listening to a word im saying
i didnt see you how you doing you all right
they dont want to help me they dont want me to climb mountains
dont worry they will give it time
theyre angry with you theyll leave as soon as our captain returns they wont help me but you can i want to stay here please
archer to enterprise
go ahead
that was one hell of a ride ill tell you about it in a couple of hours weve got a lot of data to download into their computers
i think it would be best if you come back immediately sir theres been an incident
where is she
its not exactly a she sir
where
in my quarters
how long ago did this happen
last night after supper
they demanded that she be returned immediately
i did exactly what youd do captain its not like i had much choice i wasnt going to just
will you excuse us subcommander
i might have expected something like this from a firstyear recruit but not you you did exactly what id do if thats true then ive done a pretty lousy job setting an example around here youre a senior officer on this ship youre privy to the moral challenges ive had to face you know ive wrestled with the fine line between doing what i think is right and interfering with other species so dont tell me you know what i would have done when i dont even know what i would have done
i didnt think it would hurt to teach her how to read
then you didnt think hard enough were out here to meet new species not tell them what to do
teaching her to read is no different than you giving them books or movies
giving them books is a lot different than suggesting they defy their culture and they asked me for the books did she ask you to teach her how to read
no sir
and sneaking into her quarters bringing her on enterprise lying about where you were going why  come with me
you dont understand i cant go back
just until we resolve this
trip said i have the same rights as they do
its not our place to tell you what rights you have im sorry
are you going to force me to leave
some men can work together for years without creating the friendship and bond that we did in only two days im certain we can resolve this
im afraid it may not be that simple on my world when someone asks for asylum it has to be given serious consideration
were not on your world and i doubt whether this person truly understood what your engineer was suggesting
ive been told this person is just as capable of understanding as any of you are
why are we debating this the cogenitor belongs on our ship or are you suggesting my wife and i abandon our plans to have a child
ive been asked to give sanctuary to someone who believes shes been treated unfairly i cant ignore that
were the ones being treated unfairly do you know how long weve waited to be given a cogenitor
given you sound like youre talking about some inanimate object
you have no right to judge us you know nothing about our culture what if one of your stewards the men who are forced to serve you food what if they should ask us for asylum
theyre not forced to do anything
i apologise but its easy to misunderstand someone when you know nothing about their culture
you cant expect me to ignore someone when they ask for my protection
were in no rush to leave take your time consider what weve said
you shouldnt have misgivings youve made the right choice
come in
captain archer
im afraid shakespeare only wrote thirty six plays so it might be best if you take your time memorising them
by all means i hope yesterdays unfortunate incident wont interfere with future relations between our people
you sure you dont have an extra stratopod you could spare
im sure your starfleet will develop one soon enough goodbye captain
safe journey
time to say goodbye to the hypergiant prepare to get underway travis
go ahead
theres a call coming in from the vissian captain sir he sounds upset
put him through
come in
you wanted to see me captain
i was just told that the vissian cogenitor died
what how
suicide trip she killed herself
that cant be why its my fault im responsible
youre damn right you are and its not just her theres a child who wont be conceived because of this at least not for a long while its time you learned to weigh the possible repercussions of your actions youve always been impulsive maybe this will teach you a lesson
i understand
do you im not so sure you do you knew you had no business interfering with those people but you just couldnt let it alone you thought you were doing the right thing i might agree if this was florida or singapore but its not is it were in deep space and a person is dead a person whod still be alive if we hadnt made first contact i guess i havent been very successful at getting through to you if i had you would have thought a lot harder before doing what you did
youre not responsible
dismissed
captain
i think this is the place
take a look around
over here definitely humanoid but i dont recognise the species
seems very well preserved
getting him out of heres going to be a delicate operation
drake to arctic one
go ahead
set up a base camp get alpha team started
acknowledged
contact starfleet tell commander williams he owes me a bottle of scotch
sir
hell know what it means drake out
im picking up em traces a few dozen metres under the glacier theres a lot more here than were seeing  weve got another one
i give up what is it
an arm its his
youre joking
from what i can tell it was integrated into his circulatory and nervous systems he could probably operate it like it was his own flesh and blood
i met a vulcan scientist who wore a prosthesis he lost his forearm its pretty sophisticated but it doesnt compare to this
take a look at the eyepiece judging by the optics id say he could see most of the em spectrum
did you run a genetic analysis
thats even more interesting they dont have much in common they belong to two different species
transmit your findings to starfleet maybe theyll find a match in their database
right away
sir ive run every test in the book i still cant identify this alloy
what about this
i thought it was simple thermal damage until i found signs of antimatter residue
maybe their warp drive overloaded
that could explain why theres not much debris i did find some carbon traces
could you date them
this debris has been here for about a hundred years
take a look at this do you see those devices theyre repairing the cell membranes
what are they
i believe youre looking at a form of nanotechnology i found thousands of these in both aliens theyre not just regenerating the damaged tissue theyre repairing the mechanical components as well as far as i can tell this arms as good as new
the denobulans have experimented with nanotechnology but they have nothing like this
maybe we should move the bodies to module three put them back in cold storage with the other samples that way we can examine them later under controlled conditions
couldnt the bodies be damaged if we freeze them again
i guess its possible
then we should leave them here let the regeneration process continue
what if it revives more of their systems we dont know anything about this species or what they were doing here a hundred years ago
theres no reason to assume theyre hostile
they dont exactly look friendly
starfleet has asked us to find out everything we can keep them here for now well see what happens
anything
oh plenty
you seem a little jumpy
cybernetic corpses digging through frozen remains in the middle of the night why would i be jumpy
id be more worried about the polar bears
ive identified twenty two fragments of the outer hull each one has the same curvature i think this ship was a perfect sphere
how big
about six hundred metres in diameter
the debris field could be a lot more extensive than we thought we might want to get another excavation team out here  what is it
a warp signature
help me with this
just what the doctor ordered
thanks
how are your friends
a little on the quiet side
theres a broken heating unit in module three theyve asked me to take a look will you be all right here
go ahead ill be fine
feeling better
deuterium residue might be some kind of warp coil
seems too small for a ship this size
id like to bring it back to the lab take a closer look
here here get me a medical kit
admiral theres a problem with the a6 excavation team the science council hasnt heard from them in three days
get a shuttle ready
the admiral thinks that theyre humanoids enhanced with technology he believes they abducted the research team
were a long way from the arctic what can we do
earth tracking stations spotted the transport leaving orbit at warp three point nine
thats impossible those transports cant exceed one point four
i think its safe to assume these aliens reconfigured the engines using technology from their own ship
does starfleet know where the vessel is now
not exactly but their heading puts them within a half dozen light years of our current position weve been ordered to find the ship
it shouldnt be difficult to isolate their warp signature
well start searching at these coordinates go to tactical alert lay in a course
aye sir
buried in the ice for a century
hard to believe anything could survive
handsome devil
you wanted to see me lieutenant
yes the researchers gathered a great deal of biometric data on these aliens but im having trouble making heads or tails of it
how can i help
well this arm might contain some sort of weapon if i can determine its yield well have a better idea of what were facing
what sort of people would replace perfectly good body parts with cybernetic implants
you of all people should be openminded about technology
i dont have a problem with it as long as it stays outside of my skin
if your heart was damaged would you want me to replace it with a synthetic organ or would you rather die
thats different
theres a species i once encountered in the beta magellan system the bynars when theyre born a surgeon removes the childs parietal lobe and replaces it with a synaptic processor i saw the procedure performed once it was very impressive
yeah im sure it was anything
i dont see any evidence of a weapon
the research team was heavily armed how did these aliens manage to overpower them
bridge to captain archer
go ahead
were receiving an automated distress call its from a tarkalean freighter
theres a lot of interference to any ship within range were under attack by an unknown species request immediate assistance thats it sir
how long to reach them
about an hour
set a course
open a channel this is captain archer of the starfleet vessel enterprise stand down your attack or well open fire
theyre charging weapons
some kind of proton burst those transports arent normally armed
obviously the engines arent the only system theyve upgraded
any human biosigns
nine on the arctic transport the readings are erratic
can you disable their weapons
i believe so
their weapons are down
theyre going to warp
is there anyone alive on the tarkalean ship
two biosigns on their upper deck im reading minimal life support
hold our position get a shuttlepod ready  you have the bridge
the tarkaleans should live but the nanoprobes have infiltrated their autonomic systems their renal glands have been replaced with devices like this essentially these individuals are being transformed into some sort of cybernetic hybrid
you said the human biosigns were erratic
its likely the researchers are going through a similar transformation
can you remove the nanoprobes
not surgically these devices are multiplying at an extraordinary rate i could never extract them all im attempting to slow their progress with a modified retrovirus but so far i havent been very successful
perhaps you should isolate them in the decon chamber
if you do that i wont be able to treat them as effectively i dont believe theyre a danger to the crew
im not so sure ill have malcolm post a guard keep me updated
come in
ive contacted tarkalea i told them were doing everything we can for their crewmen
any sign of the transport
nothing
there was something familiar about all this but i couldnt put my finger on it until i find this speech zefram cochrane made eighty nine years ago when i was a kid i read everything i could about him it took me a while but i finally found it in the database he was giving a commencement address at princeton when he started to talk about what really happened during first contact he mentioned a group of cybernetic creatures from the future who tried to stop his first warp flight when he was living in montana he said they were defeated by a group of humans who were also from the future
as i recall cochrane was famous for his imaginative stories he was also known to be frequently intoxicated
no one took him seriously and he recanted the whole thing a few years later but you have to admit there are similarities
he said their ultimate goal was to enslave the human race
if he was right they might be heading back to their homeworld so they can try again
who are you
my name is phlox im a physician you are aboard a starship we responded to your distress call
what did you do to me
your vessel was attacked im doing my very best to treat you  im going to sedate him
doctor phlox
what happened
we were attacked  ive been infected with the nanoprobes one of the aliens injected me some sort of tubules
captain
they left through here
seal off the maintenance shafts post teams at every access point when you find them put them in decon maximum security
aye sir
use extreme caution lieutenant their physical strength has been enhanced its critical that you dont let them touch you  you havent been infected
thanks doctor
stay here in case there are any more problems
understood
call the bridge if you need anything
actually its feeding time for my edosian slugs theyre quite partial to boiled rootleaf i usually pick some up from the galley but under the circumstances
ill have it brought down
theyve modified most of the primary systems engines hull plating these look like weapons nodes i dont even want to guess what this things for
doesnt look like theyve enhanced the aft plating yet if we can punch through here we should be able to knock out this eps manifold take down their main power
one or two torpedoes ought to do it
tpol to captain archer
go ahead
ive located the transport on longrange sensors theyre traveling at warp four point eight
how far are they
less than two light years
i need you to coax a little more power out of the engines
ill give it a shot
travis lay in a course warp four point nine
aye sir
they doubled their top speed in less than twelve hours
lets hope they didnt have time to upgrade their weapons
stop what youre doing ill fire if i have to  i said step away
maximum setting
fall back
reed to the bridge
go ahead
theyre in maintenance shaft c
junction twelve they appear to be modifying systems
whats in that junction
warp plasma regulators
can you stop them
our weapons were useless theyre equipped with some kind of energy shielding
sir our warp fields destabilising
its them
isnt there an outer hatch in that junction
yes
malcolm get out of that section and seal it off
understood
come on go
take us out of warp
were clear captain
subcommander
the junctions empty
close the hatch and repressurise malcolm i want you to work with trip
find out what they were doing in there
aye sir
resume course and speed
you had no choice
room service
whats this
rootleaf lettuce for your slugs vulcan sandworms for the bat and angel hair pasta for the ships physician
its best if i avoid food for the time being
you need to keep up your strength
if i eat my cellular metabolism will accelerate the nanoprobes could spread further
well its right here if you change your mind
why are you wearing a phase pistol
oh its lieutenant reeds idea if you come near me im supposed to shoot you
i hope youll use the stun setting
its going to be a few hours before we catch up with that transport im sure that captain archer wouldnt mind if i stayed for a little while kept you company
i appreciate the offer but it may not be safe to be near me right now
im armed remember youve looked after me more times than i can count i want to return the favour
the technology could assert itself at any moment i dont know what will happen if it does i underestimated these nanoprobes once i dont intend to make the same mistake twice
do you mind if i feed your animals before i go
they did a real number on these circuits it could take days to get all this junk out
what do you think they were doing here
i dont know but they almost overloaded the plasma regulators doesnt make a whole lot of sense why blow up the ship if youre still on it hand me that will you
that shielding of theirs was impressive we might as well have been firing holographic bullets
too bad you didnt get a closer look that kind of technology could come in handy
theres got to be a way to get through those shields with phase pistols if i crosspolarise the power cells it might increase the particle yield ill be in the armoury
coffee with cream
i believe crewman cunningham is in the galley if youd like something else
thisll be fine
is this seat taken
please lieutenant reed informed me that you plan to disable the transport when we find it
he thinks we can knock out the power systems without causing too much damage
so you still intend to rescue the humans
thats the general idea
if theyve already been transformed that could be difficult
i want to take these people home the humans and the tarkaleans no matter what state theyre in
there are twenty nine lifeforms on that transport its logical to assume theyve all been infected we could endanger enterprise if theyre brought aboard perhaps you should reconsider
are you saying we shouldnt go after that ship
im saying we destroy it
phlox to captain archer
go ahead
could you please come to sickbay
on my way im not ready to declare them a lost cause
how are you feeling
better than i anticipated the nanoprobes seem to be having trouble with my immune system but theyre persistent little fellows it wont be long before they adapt
any progress finding a treatment
possibly ive been attempting to treat the infection as if it were well an infection then it suddenly occurred to me this isnt a biological problem i need to think like an engineer not a physician i extracted several of the devices and subjected them to different forms of radiation their intramolecular processors appear to be vulnerable to omicron particles but if one of the nanoprobes survives it will start to multiply again so ill need to programme a rather excessive dose the side effects will not be pleasant to say the least you may want to keep this in the event im unsuccessful
what is it
a cure of sorts it contains a neural toxin that will terminate my synaptic functions within a matter of seconds
arent you jumping the gun a little
i have no intention of turning into one of those cybernetic creatures
increase power another five megajoules fire keep it going increase to seven megajoules try eight nine the densitys holding bring it up to ten
that should do it well reach that transport in less than an hour lets modify as many of these as we can
the vessels mass has increased by three percent
theyve improved their defences since we last saw them
theyre accelerating warp four point nine six nine eight
increase speed
were closing
target that eps manifold
theyre dropping to impulse
theyre sending a transmission some kind of activation sequence
block it
i cant
tucker to the bridge these cybernetic circuits just lit up like a christmas tree
theyre disrupting our plasma network main power is failing
were losing weapons
they set us up
theyre hailing us audio only
this is captain
you will be assimilated resistance is futile
hull platings down eighty one percent
trip we could use weapons
its going to be a few minutes
platings down another twelve percent
is the transporter still on line
for the moment
then youre with me
captain
im counting on you to pull us out of there
doctor
ive programmed the irradiation sequence but ill need you to activate it once the chambers sealed all you have to do is press this
ive doubled the particle yield it may take a few seconds to recharge after each shot
put us as close as you can to their eps manifold
aye sir
hull platings at twenty three percent
this was one of the researchers
was
look at these biosigns theyre not human anymore
sir
weve been boarded six biosigns c deck
alert security bridge to commander tucker
go ahead
how much longer
i think ive isolated
one of the power relays stand by
another human
same as the others
thats it
captain
weve lost hull plating
theyre cutting into the hull e deck starboard forequarter
evacuate that section
theyve adapted hurry malcolm
archer to enterprise stand by transporter
acknowledged
now
tucker to the bridge
go ahead
the alien circuits are losing power
do we have weapons
theyre coming online now
report
our engines and weapons are back online the transports been disabled so has the alien circuitry did you find the research team
there isnt anyone on that ship we can help anymore
sir somethings happening on the transport their systems are being restored theyre charging weapons
target their warp core hit them with everything weve got
get me admiral forrest
arent you supposed to be in bed
im merely catching up on some paperwork nothing too strenuous i assure you its vital to keep the mind occupied during the healing process
they say doctors make the worst patients
captain theres something you should know i had a rather strange experience while i was infected i believe i was connected with the aliens possibly through some form of telepathy
do you think they were trying to communicate with you
not precisely it felt as though i was part of a group consciousness
you were under extraordinary physical stress you may have imagined it
it seemed quite real i couldnt understand most of what i was hearing but i got the distinct impression they were trying to send a subspace message they transmitted a numerical sequence i heard it over and over again
come in
the computer analysed phloxs numbers theyre pulsar frequencies with geometric light year measurements
spatial coordinates
they told their homeworld how to find earth
did you learn where the message was sent
somewhere deep in the delta quadrant
then i doubt theres any immediate danger it would take at least two hundred years for a subspace message to reach the delta quadrant assuming its received at all
sounds to me like weve only postponed the invasion until what the twenty fourth century
it could be a phantom reading background radiation
even your scientists have confirmed the existence of dark matter
but never in such dense concentration
thats the point if it really is a dark matter nebula wed be the first to directly observe one
even with modified sensors there wouldnt be much to see
ive heard of vulcan experiments where they were able to excite dark matter by bombarding it with metrion particles
those tests involved very small quantities this structure is nearly ten million kilometres in diameter
could you rig some kind of spatial charges something that would spread the metrion particles over a wider area
if i can it should put on a hell of a show
sorry to interrupt captain its admiral forrest
get to work on these charges
aye captain
this is good timing admiral we just picked up some very interesting sensor readings
im afraid ive got some bad news jon its ag he was back on mount mckinley there was an accident he was killed im sorry
youve got six spatial charges i rigged them myself
what are their ranges
if theres any dark matter within five hundred kilometres youll know it
thanks
you sure you dont want some company
if this nebula exists we dont know what effect it could have on the shuttlepod
all the more reason to bring your engineer along
not this time trip
i still cant believe it
all the close calls he had flying warp trials and he gets killed climbing mount mckinley
ive brought some sensor enhancements
thanks
well find them useful in mapping the nebula if its there
we
this is a scientific mission its only logical to bring your science officer
id prefer to handle this myself
commander tucker obviously didnt remind you that starfleet regulations prohibit the captain from leaving the ship unaccompanied
we should reach the edge of the phenomenon in two hours forty six minutes i can pass the time by meditating but if youd prefer to talk
go ahead and meditate
would you like to join me you seem quite unsettled since your call from admiral forrest
im fine
commander tucker was reluctant to discuss it as well though he did mention an old colleague had died
a starfleet captain a g robinson i wouldnt be out here if it werent for him
im somewhat familiar with starfleet history ive never heard of a captain robinson
im sure theres a paragraph about him in the vulcan data base we were in the nx test programme trying to break the warp two barrier there was just a few of us gardner duvall ag and me we all wanted the first flight
and i was cocky enough to think id be the one to get it
come in
sorry im late commodore i came straight from the test bay
at ease commander i heard your got the warp reactor up to ninety percent today
ninety two sir you didnt call me here to ask about an engine test we all know the assignments about to be handed out im guessing this is either really good news or
im going with commander robinson
ags a fine pilot
it wasnt an easy decision youll be backup
sounds good you know i spent more time in the simulator than anyone if i can do anything to help ag prepare for
jon its your fathers engine i know how important this was to you
the most important thing to me is that we succeed is there anything else
no commander dismissed
thanks ruby
you all right
sure why
the last time you had this much to drink was the day caroline moved to new berlin my guess is forrest gave out the assignment today
sherlock holmes has nothing on you
theyll need a pilot for the next flight
do you remember what buzz aldrin said when he stepped on the moon
no
nobody does because armstrong went first
congratulations
you mean that
of course not im waiting for forrest to realise what a horrible mistake he made until then let me buy you a drink
no ill buy you one consolation prize two more leo
here you go
to commander a g robinson we all worked hard to get this flight but in the end the best pilot won just ask him ag
ag
take it easy commander youre due in the simulator at oh seven hundred first flights in two weeks
you know why you didnt get this assignment
i bet youre going to tell me
you tried too hard you did everything by the book you burned the midnight oil in that simulator eighteen twenty hour days you shut everything and everyone out of your life just so you could be the first
and
you still dont understand starfleet doesnt just want a great pilot they want a great captain
you said captain robinson was a close friend
thats right
from what youve told me your relationship seemed adversarial
only one of us was going to get to fly that ship nothing wrong with a little healthy competition
he did have a point it does take more than piloting ability to command a starship
i agree
fortunately you seem to have developed the necessary skills
was that a compliment
an observation i assume captain robinsons flight was successful
not exactly he was lucky to come out of it in one piece
nx control i thought we built a warp ship so we could go to warp
maintain your orbit were trying to run down a problem with the stabilisation protocols
i saw italy go by again if this is going to take much longer maybe you can send up some food
what can i get you
how about some of those deep fried mushrooms from the 602
ill send ruby up to take your order
we are clear on the stabilisation protocols restart countdown at thirty seconds
good news ag i just got word from the powers that be that youre good to go
acknowledged wsp is nominal apus are good
warp field initialisation in twenty seconds
im breaking orbit at least the thrusters work i did get a little variance on the rcs
we noticed that here do you want to bring her back to the garage
not on your life
weve got an stable warp field
nx control to nx alpha you have my permission to go to warp
see you in a few light years
warp one one point five that little bump you just felt was warp two congratulations now lets see if you can get it up to two point one
shes getting a little shaky
are you sure youve got that stabilisation problem ironed out
field integritys down to twenty percent
the warp field wont hold
ag were getting some pretty unusual telemetry down here we need you to go sublight until we get this sorted out
did you hear me
im at two point one i think i can get more out of her
negative abort
warp two point one five
this is forrest drop to impulse thats an order
two point two
the fields collapsing
ag youve got to get out of there
weve lost telemetry
nx control to nx alpha come in ag can you hear me
particle density is increasing
we should be entering the nebula
the readings could be misleading
as doctor phlox would say optimism
optimism doesnt alter the law of physics
time to put trips charges to the test three seconds
anything
we need to move deeper into the nebula if it exists
what happened
the field emissions on the charges could have been too low or maybe were just on a wild goose chase
i was referring to captain robinson his test flight
he made the record books for being the first person to deploy an escape pod at warp but he lost one of two nx prototypes nearly derailed the entire programme
are you all right
a little shaky trust me you dont want to pass through the warp barrier in one of those should make a nice addition to the starfleet museum
what went wrong
im not sure sir the closer i got to two point two the more trouble i had keeping the field stable
you where ordered to abort
the abort call was premature we had some instability on the previous tests but it always settled down
your engine design is obviously unsound
theres nothing wrong with that engine
you have something to add lieutenant
tucker sir im on captain jefferies engineering team weve never pumped this much antimatter through the injectors before its going to take us a little time to get the intermix right
thats precisely the point your programme is moving too quickly
just because it took you a hundred years to crack warp two doesnt mean itll take us that long
lieutenant
sorry sir
hes right this is a new engine its bound to have a few bugs to work out
those bugs just scattered your ship across five thousand kilometres of space and nearly killed your pilot
were not going to get anywhere without taking some risks
i know where you stand on this commander
weve got a lot of data to analyse before we know what happened we should be grateful we only lost the ship
cyrus
cyrus
whos cyrus
it was my great grandfathers name
keep trying tucker
chester how about rosalie if its a girl come on give me a hint
shes had names for her kids picked out since she was ten says shell marry the first man to guess them
whats your name lieutenant
charles tucker sir but everyone calls me trip
trip
my dads charles tucker and so was his dad that makes me the third so triple trip
thanks with your help today with our vulcan friends trip my father would have appreciated it
i dont get it its like they want us to fail
i gave up trying to figure out the vulcans a long time ago
commodore
at ease may i
of course
can i buy you a drink sir
its the least you can do after that outburst today
im sorry sir i didnt mean to
ill have a beer mister tucker
its been a while since ive been in here i see it hasnt changed much
is there something on your mind sir
i came here to tell you at the urging of the vulcan advisory council that starfleet command has decided to put the nx programme on hold
for how long
indefinitely
gentlemen
one beer
what do you mean indefinitely
they want to go back to the drawing board jon develop a new engine from scratch
we have an engine that works now if we start over itll be decades before we get into deep space
starfleets made its decision
permission to speak freely sir its your fathers engine his lifes work you cant let them do this
bourbon straight up
i suppose you heard
this is really going to throw a wrench in my career plans
thanks
last call anything else
ill have another
where have you been all day
debriefing after the flight surgeons were done with me i got hauled in front of the starfleet senior staff and the vulcans
whatd you tell them
what do you think the subspace field destabilised at warp two point two primary flight controls failed resulting in the loss of the vehicle
arent you forgetting something
what
the possibility of pilot error
im not interested in your opinion lieutenant
you should be the vulcans have been leaning on starfleet for years to rein in this programme you walked in there today ruled out pilot error and told them just what they wanted to hear our engine doesnt work
sorry to be the bearer of bad news archer but it doesnt work
the engines sound we just need more time to balance the intermix
we need more than time
i agree we need a pilot who listens to orders if you aborted wed still have a ship and probably another chance
another chance to what get killed
at the first sign of trouble you shouldve throttled down
it wouldnt have made a damn bit of difference
i guess well never find out
you werent in that cockpit
theres nothing wrong with that ship
theres plenty wrong you just refuse to see it
what the hells that supposed to mean
every time theres a problem with this project you blame it on pilot error or gravitational anomalies or some technical malfunction well youre going to have to face the truth this time because theres nothing left to point an finger at your father designed a lousy engine
thats enough  do something
come on come on break it up
break it up
do you think this is going to get either of you any closer to warp five
the fight was interrupted
not before i got two bruised ribs and a cracked molar
i suppose well never know who would have won
main power is fluctuating
its all right auxiliarys kicking in
there was a surge in the eps grid
we must be getting close trip said the dark matter might affect the shuttles systems hell be happy to hear he was right
it was probably nothing more than a simple malfunction
i dont think so our prelaunch checks were all fine something else caused that surge
im not detecting any dark matter
have a little faith tpol
even if youre right it may be dangerous to proceed another surge could disable life support
one thing i learned from ag youre never going to get anywhere without taking risks
you obviously admired this man
quite a bit
and yet he cracked your molar
humans can have funny ways of forming friendships
to say the least
he would have loved it out here too bad he never got the chance god knows he earned it
i thought you said he was responsible for nearly ending the programme
he was also responsible for getting it back on course with a little help from me and trip
i see youre not losing any time
were done flying no use hanging around here you go
im not clearing out just yet
suit yourself
ive been thinking about what you were saying last night about my fathers engine
look i was out of line
you were right i wanted to see this thing fly so badly it kept me from being objective
thats good of you to admit but it doesnt really matter now
it may i got my hands on the telemetry from your flight it looks like tucker was right about the intermix but i think we can compensate for it
you heard forrest the programme is on hold indefinitely
we can take this to starfleet make a case to get off the ground again
what about the vulcans theyll look at your data and say we need to run computer simulations for another ten years to prove that youre right
commodore forrest will back us up
forrest answers to starfleet command its out of his hands
even if his two senior pilots insist that this ship can fly if the three of us go in there together we might be able to change their minds you just went faster than any human being ever has and now your going to walk away let them put the ship in mothballs when were so close to breaking warp three youre always talking about taking risks what have we got to lose
if you want to convince the vulcans youll have to do a lot better than showing them a bunch of antimatter calculations
im open to suggestions
we only lost one ship still have one left
theyll never give us clearance
can you think of a better way to prove itll fly you want to talk about taking risks youre a great pilot maybe as good as me but youre never going to get out into deep space by playing it safe when the first warp five starship is built its captain wont be able to call home every time he needs to make a decision he wont be able to turn to the vulcans unless he decides to take one with him
we should be twenty thousand kilometres inside the nebula lets load up two more charges
the history of your early warp flights is welldocumented but ive never read anything about two starfleet pilots stealing the warp three prototype
it wasnt the kind of thing starfleet command wanted to advertise dont you believe me
i have no doubt it happened though i find it difficult to believe you had to be convinced to participate
well you didnt know me then i was a little more bythebook
the particle density has nearly doubled shall we try again  perhaps we should head back
we still have two more charges lets keep looking
was your test flight successful
promise you wont put this into the vulcan database
we decided on a night launch
ive routed the intermix controls to the engineering station if it becomes unstable youll be able to adjust it manually
thanks
if i came along i could monitor the antimatter flow
ill keep an eye on it
youre going to have your hands full
we need you down here dont worry youll get out there someday if i had my own ship id sign you up in a second
im going to hold you to it
thanks trip
no response from the auxiliary apus
thats because they havent been installed yet
hows it coming trip
ive disabled
the tracking sensors but ill need a minute to divert the telemetry
how long
dont wait for me ill be ready by the time you break orbit
acknowledged
not to late to call this off head over to the 602 for a beer
not on your life
anyone noticed were gone yet
no as far as they know the doors are closed and the lights are out
but new berlin should be picking you up in about six minutes
by the time they figure out whats going on well be half way to jupiter
come in youre working late
we just got a call new berlins detected the nx beta
what
internal sensors show its still in the hangar
has anyone bothered to look
warp field is stable
something wrong
why dont you take it
what
i had the last flight youre due up
besides you could use the practice i hope you and tucker were right about that intermix
were about to find out
this is forrest
what the hell is going on
just running an engine test sir
archer turn around right now and ill do what i can
to keep you out of prison if you
archer
perfect
thats warp two
here we go again im reading fluctuations in the intermix
we see it
your warp fields destabilising
warp two point one five  youd better get that intermix locked down because im not backing off till i break your record got it
almost
come with us lieutenant
nx beta do you read
nx beta to commodore forrest you might want to check your sensors youll see that were holding steady at two point five
congratulations now get the hell back here
not only was it in violation of a direct order it was utterly reckless irresponsible and maybe even criminal
sir
im not done commander you are both suspended from duty pending an inquiry and by the time starfleet command gets through with you youre going to wish that you had never come back youre supposed to represent the best that starfleet has to offer keeping this programme on track is hard enough without our own officers undermining it what did you think that this stunt of yours would accomplish that just because you didnt get yourselves killed that wed ignore that data weve collected the testing weve done the recommendations of the vulcan advisory council
if we follow all their recommendations well never make it into deep space
no one is suggesting that your warp programme be dismantled only that starfleet proceed with more restraint
get lieutenant tucker in here ask any engineer on the project theyll tell you this ship can fly archer and i just proved it were ready to go now
thats not you decision to make
with all due respect its not yours either youre right sir we were reckless we knew thered be consequences we knew wed probably be thrown out of starfleet
you may have been right
ag and i may never fly again but its a small sacrifice to make if it keeps this project going we didnt build this engine to make test runs around jupiter we built it to explore if my father were alive today hed be standing here asking what the hell are we waiting for
you obviously werent dismissed from starfleet they must have found your argument convincing
convincing enough we managed to avoid a court martial but they grounded us for three months
still the nx programme continued
eventually the vulcans had us run every simulation they could think of for over a year before they finally admitted the engine would probably work eight months after that duvall broke warp three in the nx delta five years later we laid the keel for enterprise you know the rest
the particle density has increased again
id hate to see those last two charges go to waste  anything on sensors
it appears so  fascinating this data will certainly cause a debate at the science directorate
tpol come up and look at this a minute
i have to monitor the quantum field
let the sensors do it thats why ag and i worked so hard to get out here
captain robinson clearly wanted to command enterprise as much as you did
he wasnt alone but by the end ag and i were the only two candidates left they made the final selection six months before we launched maybe i just got lucky
thanks
congratulations captain
to jonathan archer first skipper of the starship enterprise  and one lucky sob
luck had nothing to do with it
it couldnt have been talent im just waiting for forrest to realise what a horrible mistake he made still they could have done a lot worst anyway id rather wait for the nx02 let you make all the mistakes so ill have an easier time of it
to the first skipper of the nx02
got to go im catching a shuttle to alice springs at oh six hundred more survival training night ruby good luck jon hey ill see you out there
captain we should start back if were going to make our rendezvous
right
welcome back howd it go
your charges were effective
was it a good show
you shouldve been there
ill remember to ask you next time
i believe theres a human custom that says when you discover something of merit you earn the right to name it
what would you suggest the tpol  archer nebula
i was thinking the robinson nebula would be more appropriate
maybe you were lightheaded from the altitude
i didnt slip that overhang gave way the moment i put my foot on it
i walked on the same rocks you did
maybe you loosened them you do weigh a few kilos more than i do
report
it dropped out of warp thirty minutes ago the pilot sent a brief audio message he insisted on speaking with you right away
any idea what he wants
he wouldnt say but i did manage to find his ship design in the vulcan database its tellarite
tpols mentioned them open a channel this is jonathan archer of the enterprise what can i do for you
you can start by telling me what youre doing here
i didnt get your name
captain skalaar of the tellarite mining consortium
were studying this planet i have three science teams on the surface were also here for a little shore leave
shore leave
vacation its been a while since weve had a chance to relax
in that case i recommend you visit the equatorial range the view from the north summit is inspiring
youve been here before
many times i prefer to think of it as my own personal retreat you mustnt leave until youve experienced the hydrothermal pools of rengham
where are they
the polar island chain two hundred and twenty seven kilometres from the southern tip of the rykos shoreline look for the pyroclastic debris field then follow the lava tubes
sounds like we could use a guide
id be happy to show you
sure were not intruding
not at all ill meet you at your starboard docking port ill help you plan your shore leave
tpol says theyre not the most agreeable species apparently they enjoy a good argument its considered a sport on their planet
ive got an old girlfriend this guy might like to meet
im picking up weapons fire on e deck the starboard airlock
send a security team bridge to captain archer
the tellarite ships trying to undock with the seals locked
engage the emergency clamps
hes going to warp
pursuit course
hes disabled our starboard nacelle we cant follow him sir
get those teams up from the surface
were having trouble isolating his signature there must have been something masking it
how long until we have warp drive
less than an hour
im on my way to the bridge
acknowledged
im afraid youre not going anywhere for the moment we brought a stowaway with us an unusual microbe
is it contagious
ill have to run some more tests to be safe we should both go through decon
what do you want i asked you a question
id stay clear of those emitters if i were you the very latest technology i installed them last month
i doubt this ship of yours will be a match for enterprise
ive taken appropriate countermeasures we wont be seeing any more of your starship
i want to know where youre taking me my crews not going to give up until they find me if you take me back id be willing to forget this ever happened
you can either be quiet or spend the rest of this trip unconscious which do you prefer
this microbe is more resilient than i thought it doesnt seem to be vulnerable to theta radiation
perhaps you can increase the dosage
that wouldnt be advisable wed both suffer permanent cellular damage
there must be something else you can try
decon gel e may neutralise the microbe but it will be several hours before we know if its effective
i cant stay here several hours
you have little choice this organism appears to be infectious and humans would be far more vulnerable to it than you or i commander tucker is quite capable if he needs your help he knows where to find you
fortunately no one else on the surface was exposed to the microbe i suspect you and i were contaminated when we climbed into the second ravine considering the quantity of fauna down there im not at all surprised we were probably infected by the marsupials i found
i told you to leave them alone
their saliva is a natural anticoagulant i couldnt return to the ship without a sample i could use your assistance
i wasnt aware a curtain was installed
not everyone is comfortable with the idea of disrobing in front of others
an odd attitude for a physician
its a characteristic of denobulan males were more inhibited than our women its led to a number of awkward moments my starfleet physical was an experience i never hope to repeat
if you wouldnt mind
sensors are picking up a faint warp signature
can you get a fix on it
bearing oh seven one mark three two its erratic but it matches our tellarite friend
set a course maximum warp
you are speaking on a secure channel
im trying to reach captain goroth its very important that i speak with him
were attempting to transfer you stand by
this is goroth what do you want
i have the fugitive
hes in your custody
hes standing about five metres from me youll be pleased to know hes still alive im bringing him to kronos as we agreed
no im transmitting rendezvous coordinates be there in two days
i trust youll have the full payment
youll get what was promised
a pleasure doing business with you captain
as always
how much are they paying you you mentioned the klingon homeworld kronos i assume this has something to do with my escaping prison you dont even know what im accused of
youre right and i dont care to
the signatures holding steady looks like hes orbiting a gtype star
go to tactical alert
it appears to be a beacon of some kind its generating a warp signature identical to the tellarites
a decoy anything on sensors
were going to have to start all over
im getting too much interference from that device its throwing off our scans
then get rid of it
with pleasure sir
i have no idea what the klingons are paying you but whatever it is starfleet will double it
i dont take bribes from criminals
im not a criminal
klingon judiciary says you are
my crime was helping a ship full of refugees
oh that was very noble of you youll think twice before doing that again
its pretty clear im never going to get the chance i was sentenced to life in prison on rura penthe ever heard of it
im familiar with rura penthe
the magistrate isnt going to be so lenient next time ill probably be executed
thats not my concern
you dont care that youre sending an innocent man to his death
ive captured dozens of fugitives every one of them claimed to be an innocent man
if the klingons wanted them they probably were you dont have to do this
goroth already knows youre aboard if i dont deliver you hell offer a reward for both of us ive learned never to cross a klingon
it must be difficult working for people like them
i dont answer to those savages i work for myself
thats not how it looks from in here
if you knew how much they were paying me youd understand this has nothing to do with you im sure youre not a bad person just an unlucky one
youre making it difficult to meditate
youve developed a slight fever im also reading elevated dopamine levels the microbe may be affecting your limbic system
i cant concentrate under these conditions
i dont mean to be intrusive
the captains been abducted he may even be dead my place is on the bridge
subcommander where are you going
open it
youll spread the infection
ill go to my quarters if i seal off the ventilation system it should minimise the risk of exposing anyone
your quarters are on c deck by the time you reach them youll contaminate half the ship
unlock this door i gave you a direct order
im sorry but i cant obey it
i can have you courtmartialed
i doubt that very
open it i apologise im having trouble suppressing my emotions
well know in a few hours whether the gel is working until then perhaps a mild sedative will help
the klingons are paying nine thousand darseks thats more than enough to get tezra back
youre not being realistic
i already have the human in custody the reward is guaranteed
youve made this promise before
in two days youll see im telling the truth
even if you get the money which i doubt it wouldnt change my decision
do you want to scrub plasma injectors the rest of your life im giving you a chance to
whos tezra
tezras not a person its a cargo ship far more impressive than this antique
youre going to use the reward to buy your ship back
youd be wise to keep quiet the klingons pay me the same whether youre alive or dead a vessels approaching i wouldnt get too optimistic its not your starship
you have something i want
always one step behind me eh kago
drop out of warp and surrender the prisoner
why would i do that
dont force me to take action
goroth told you where i was didnt he
you had two months to find the human goroth contacted me because you obviously werent going to succeed youre incompetent
if i was incompetent archer would be aboard your ship wouldnt he
the human now
or what youll destroy my shuttle cant collect on archer if hes a cloud of vapour
you may want to hold on to something
let me out i can help you
you must think im a fool
you cant manoeuvre the ship and make repairs at the same time im a pilot let me take the helm
if you try to escape
this is the warp field regulator the impulse throttle
navigation sensors
there
theres an l class planet in this system im taking us out of warp
what
we cant outrun him but he may not be able to navigate as well as we can in the planets atmosphere
this ship wasnt designed for these manoeuvres weve lost the aft cannons
what about forward cannons
still online
what are these
subspace beacons they generate a false warp signature i used one of them to evade your vessel
get ready to launch them
what good will that do
hes flying on sensors just like we are hell only have a one in three chance of targeting us
ready
now
we knocked out his engine hes making an emergency landing
dont celebrate yet our reactors leaking the warp drives offline im never going to make the rendezvous
isnt that a shame
the reactor also powers life support
then youd better get to work
it can only be accessed from the outer hull
then we should set down here
but kagos on the surface
well land a thousand kilometres away
what are you doing
you said wed need another treatment
not for three hours
is there any harm in starting now
i can apply it myself thank you perhaps you need another sedative
rest is not what i need
subcommander this behaviour is hardly appropriate
my name is tpol you dont find me attractive
of course i do but that is not the issue
i am familiar with denobulan sexuality i know that your marriages arent exclusive
you and i are colleagues its against regulations
starfleet regulations theres no reason to be restrained by human morality
its obvious youre not well please
you have no idea what youre denying yourself
your endorphin and hormonal levels are dangerously high
you dont understand im not ill
these are hardly normal readings
theyre normal for a vulcan in my condition
you know whats wrong with you
its not something we discuss with others
i believe its time for you to amend that policy you have my assurance it will remain between us
we call it the pon farr the cycle of mating
have you gone through this before
its not time
its possible the infection acted as a catalyst
what caused it doesnt matter if i dont mate with a male vulcan or otherwise ill die
that ship you mentioned the tezra sounds pretty important to you
more than you know if kago collects the reward hell probably waste it on orion slave girls not me im going to do something useful with it
i dont understand why you want a cargo ship it doesnt seem practical in your line of work
you think ive been chasing fugitives my entire life once i get the money ill have enough to pay off the impound fees ill be a freighter captain again
my helmsman used to run freight the two of you would probably have a lot to talk about
the tezra isnt like any other cargo ship she was the first of her class the fastest ever built she could haul a million metric tons at warp four point five even your starship isnt capable of that i retrofitted her engines myself
you never told me why it was impounded
my brother and i were hauling a shipment of firesalt i thought i could trim two or three days off our journey by cutting across the most insignificant corner of klingon space i learned very quickly theres no thing as an insignificant corner of klingon space we were lucky to escape with our lives though we did pay a price
they took your ship
and its cargo too my brother never forgave me ive been trying to find a way to get the tezra back every since what are you doing
did you really think i wanted this engine fixed youre taking me to be executed
dont worry well meet goroth on time
feel any better
im hungry
our meals will be here soon
i wasnt referring to food
im working as quickly as i can the serum should help alleviate most of your symptoms
theres a far simpler treatment
id prefer to explore a more conventional approach
you have the cure its unethical for you to withhold it doctor
this mating cycle of yours was artificially induced we cant be certain that a physical encounter would help
im willing to try
subcommander
dont be frightened i wont hurt you
youre disturbing my serum you obviously need to be sedated again
no more hyposprays
one of us should probably answer that it could be news about the captain this is phlox
anyone hungry in there i brought you some supper
just in the nick of time commander  it would be best if you remained here
how are you two holding up
well enough have you been able to locate captain archer
were tracking another warp signature hoping this one is the real thing are those the ones you wanted
yes thank you
is that food
yeah i had chef make you some
is she all right
she developed a slight fever nothing to be concerned about
bridge to commander tucker
go ahead
were approaching the coordinates
on my way  call if you need anything
what have you got
two matching warp signatures both in the upper atmosphere more subspace beacons there is a ship on the surface it seems to have suffered engine damage but its not tellarite
biosigns
one
open a channel
yes
sorry to bother you but were looking for a tellarite shuttle have you seen one
how much did the klingons offer you
klingons look there must be some sort of misunderstanding here were looking for our captain
your captain hes got a price on his head hes probably halfway to klingon space by now
travis how close are we to klingon space
less than six light years
if that tellarites looking to collect some kind of reward wed better find him before he gets there set a course take us back to warp
aye sir
what are you doing here
i need your help
you shouldnt have brought him
you think i would have come here if i had a choice i need an antimatter injector
and i suppose you have no way of paying for it
do you know who this is hes the only prisoner whos ever escaped from rura penthe the klingons are offering a fortune to get him back tell him  tell him
if i give you the injector you have to promise never to come back here
of course im coming back youre going to be my first officer
that was years ago i work here now
scrubbing plasma injectors is that how you want your children to see you
its better than hunting criminals
you think that i enjoy spending my time with vermin like him
i have work to do
please dont turn your back on me again we can reclaim the tezra
you wont want that ship after you see it
why not
the klingons cannibalised her every power relay every conduit
the engines
theyre gone ill give you the injector but after that i want you to leave
what do you plan to do now
get that injector and install it
and then i suppose youll turn me over to the klingons ill be disembowelled with one of those nasty looking swords of theirs youll collect your nine thousand darseks but it wont get you the tezra back
what are you trying to say
the klingons took your freighter your livelihood damaged your relationship with your brother and what do you get in exchange nine thousand darseks doesnt seem like a very fair trade to me
what choice do i have i told you if i let you go theyd kill me
maybe not have you ever been aboard goroths ship
twice why
i beg your pardon
let me out
you know i cant do that
the heat its unbearable
if i lower the temperature the serum will start to congeal
i dont want your serum open the door
i assure you youre going to feel much better in just a few minutes
open it
this will only take a moment  your biochemical imbalance is growing worse if we dont treat it now the damage to your limbic system could be irreversible you said it yourself tpol it could kill you
stay away from me
one injection thats all i ask very well
youre free to go four two eight six four thats the locking code denobulan medical ethics prevent me from treating patients against their will four two eight six four
phlox to the bridge
tucker here
you may want to evacuate d deck
shes still in this section the doctor says shes irrational so use caution
yes sir
malcolm i need your assistance
weve been very worried about you subcommander lets get you back to the doctor
i cant return to the doctor hes refusing to treat me how long has it been
i beg your pardon
since youve mated ive seen the way you look at me on the bridge
why dont we discuss this in decon
my quarters would be more comfortable
doctor phlox was very insistent
follow me subcommander
welcome
the empire never forgets its enemies taka
what about my payment
six thousand darseks
we agreed to nine
did we
thats blood money skalaar i hope you enjoy it
were being hailed commander its the tellarite ship
what put him through
ive got them bearing two two six mark seven one
set a course go to tactical alert
where do you think you can go human there isnt a planet within fifty light years
he wont get far drop out of warp
should i charge weapons
no i want him alive
i see him eight hundred thousand kilometres
what about the klingons
theyre closing in on him
theyre charging weapons
return fire deploy the grappler
theyre not making it easy
malcolm
im doing the best i can sir their weapon ports are heavily shielded
got it
bring him in
their weapons are down
the pod
safe and sound launch bay two
lets get the hell out of here
youll be pleased to know the microbes been eliminated from your system your premature mating cycle has ended
did i do anything inappropriate
ive had patients treat me far worse
did we
denobulan males arent comfortable discussing such topics
id appreciate it if you didnt mention this to anyone
id never violate a patients privacy
rough ride
whats the status of the klingons
we damaged their port nacelle theyre limping back to kronos
wheres tpol
shes in decon with doctor phlox
what happened
its a long story
youre being hailed captain
i see you made it back safely
do you think the klingons know you gave me that lock pick
i dont see why they would
what are you going to do with your reward
im not sure if you know of an old freighter for sale
ill keep my eyes open
be careful captain its likely the klingons will double their bounty
i hope you wont be the one to collect it
no promises
twice twice hes been captured and twice hes escaped our magistrate should never have shown him mercy he should have been executed for his crimes
you had a simple mission duras locate the rebels that archer was harbouring and return them to the empire but you failed archer made a fool of you
we are offering you a chance to regain your command and your honour
i will not fail
it must be something pretty serious
whats going on
the captain wants to talk to us
about what
hes speaking to admiral forrest its the third time in the last hour
well somethings obviously up
i cant remember the last time he asked me to join the senior staff for a briefing
maybe it has something to do with the
theres been an attack on earth
what do you mean attack
a probe they dont know where it came from it fired a weapon that cut a swath four thousand kilometres long from florida to venezuela there may have been a million casualties
a million
weve been recalled
did they say why
i didnt ask
itll take a while to get back sir
bridge to captain archer
go ahead
its admiral forrest sir
understood set a course travis warp five
come in
excuse me captain
trip
when you spoke to admiral forrest did he say what part of florida was hit
no im sorry
she may have been away architects take a lot of trips
older or younger
my baby sister when we were in school i made sure all the boys in her class got a good look at me none of them ever messed with her
maybe she was away
anything you can tell me about what the admiral said
the number of casualties has been revised its up to three million
why would someone do this
come in
i spoke with ambassador soval
and
a vulcan transport located the pod in central asia they retrieved it and brought it to starfleet headquarters
what do they know
very little there was a pilot killed on impact
who the hell was he what species
they dont know
they say anything about what part of florida was hit
no
trips sister lives in florida  archer
captain weve got suliban ships eight of them approaching at high warp
just what we need tactical alert
hail them
theyre not responding
try again
the captain
theres someone who needs to speak with you
silik i knew youd have something to do with this
do with what
millions of people you killed millions of people
im afraid i dont know what youre talking about
that wouldnt be wise captain
what the hell am i doing here
theres someone who needs to speak with you he has information you should find helpful dont worry you wont be harmed
information about what
something to do with your species its in great danger
he can see you more clearly if you move closer
who is he
he wants to talk to you it would be foolish to ignore him
what do you want
your planet was attacked
im aware of that
what youre not aware of is why the probe was sent by the xindi they learned that their world would be destroyed by humans in four hundred years
how would they know whats going to happen in four hundred years
they were told by people from the future people who can communicate through time
are they the ones the suliban are working for
the suliban work for me
so youre the one who tried to start a civil war in the klingon empire the one whos manipulated my mission from day one
the people who have contacted the xindi belong to another faction the probe was only a test the xindi are building a far more powerful weapon when it is completed they will use it to destroy earth
annihilate us before we can annihilate them why are you telling me this
the xindi were not supposed to learn of their future if they deploy this weapon it will contaminate the timeline you must not let that happen
why should i believe you
you have no choice but to believe me
if this time traveller is trying to protect humanity why didnt he tell you all this before millions of people were killed
he didnt think wed believe him hes probably right
im sure starfleet and the high command will find a far more logical explanation of who attacked earth
he may be telling the truth if he is i need your support not your damn scepticism
captain thats our sun
a vessels dropping out of warp
where
two hundred kilometres off port
who are they
theyve fired some kind of
that one took out both forward phase cannons
you still have torpedoes
its a klingon bird of prey
they want you sir theyre saying they wont destroy enterprise if you surrender to them archers an enemy of the empire he must be brought to justice if honours to be regained
duras
both their nacelles are crippled
weapons
their cannons are down
cease firing prepare a boarding party
three ships approaching
return fire
shields are failing
are they offline
no sir
then keep firing
weve lost disruptor banks three and four
withdraw go to warp speed
its captain ramirez sir on the intrepid
what the hell was that all about
a klingon named duras hes not very fond of me
welcome home captain i wish it was under better circumstances
i told command everything you said theyre having a hard time buying it
do they have a better idea of who did this and how about the vulcans i suppose you think im hallucinating
our science directorate has determined that time travel is impossible
are you willing to risk a second attack all im asking is to take enterprise and find these xindi what do we have to lose a single starship seems like a small price to pay if theres one chance in a million that hes right
do you know where these coordinates he gave you are
at warp five about a three month trip
theyre inside the delphic expanse
whats that
a region of space nearly two thousand light years across vulcan ships have entered it but only a few have returned
sounds like your talking about the bermuda triangle
there has been reports of fierce and dangerous species unexplained anomalies in some regions even the laws of physics dont apply twenty years ago a klingon vessel emerged from the expanse every crewmen on board has been anatomically inverted their bodies splayed open and they were still alive youd be more than foolish to pursue this course of action
its a risk im willing to take and i imagine most of my crew would be with me
this is typical of your impulsiveness youd be putting your crews lives at stake when you have no evidence that anything you were told were true
weve lost a lot of people already jon starfleet command would need some kind of proof before they let you go
im not sure the person i spoke to was from the future or not but he knew this would be the reaction that id get so he did give me proof
jon
this is quantum dating the debris take a look the principal alloy in this piece was synthesised within the last four years this one about a year earlier
what exactly are you trying to show us captain
twelve years for this piece
your point jonathan
im getting to it
you might find this interesting
your scanners not working properly
why is that sir
the quantum data reads minus four twenty
whats wrong with that
quantum dating always registers in positive numbers
then i guess this ones not working either
you said he told you this faction from the future could only communicate through time so how do you suggest they get this component to the xindi
i havent the slightest idea but that doesnt change whats on these scanners this fragments from the future unless you have another explanation
a lack of another explanation doesnt make your assumption correct
ill speak with command
id like to take a look in there
are you suggesting this is a xindi
i sure as hell would like to find out
this is doctor ferat
i dont have a lot of time whats up
the vulcan research team detected traces of pyretic radiation in the alien debris
why didnt starfleet catch it
some of our technology is still more advanced then yours
were going to need to treat anyone who got close to the wreckage doctor ferat is here to determine the extent of your exposure
it shouldnt take long please have a seat
have you experienced any nausea or dizziness
no
numbness in your extremities
i feel fine
i was told that you think a piece of the wreckage came from the future
i know vulcans dont believe in time travel
some of us do tell me this time traveller you met was he humanoid
how do you know about that
i was briefed before coming here
he seemed humanoid but i couldnt see him that well
have you encountered people from the future before
a number of times does this have anything to do with the radiation
i was just curious it must be very difficult to have so many people question your story does it upset you
doesnt help
but how does it make you feel
i told you it doesnt help
i can sense some anger when you talk about this
its kind of strange that a vulcan would be so interested in my feelings
just curious your exposure seems minimal youll require very little treatment i imagine you must have felt very anxious after meeting someone from the future
why would you imagine that
im afraid this examination is over
im nearly finished
you are finished i just checked the vulcan database theres only one doctor ferat listed and hes not a pathologist hes a psychiatric analyst
soval sure is persistent what did he want you to do come back with proof that im out of my mind
you come to my sickbay under false pretenses where are your medical ethics
im just doing what i was told to
well im telling you to get the hell off my ship if you wouldnt mind phlox id like you to escort our guest to the airlock
gladly
jonathan
youre a sight for sore eyes tommy
good to see you
slow tonight
people are staying home ever since
is she here
over there you are late
thanks bring me a scotch
right away
im really sorry
i cant remember the last time you werent late did they bring you back because of what happened for how long
i wish it was longer i was hoping to spend some time with you
do they know who did this why they did this
we know a little bit but not enough ill probably be gone for a long time becky
youve been gone for a long time before and if i find out youve got a girl in every spaceport  i suppose you expect me to invite you back to my apartment
what are my chances
youre in luck
im so sorry
the house was over there less then a kilometre see over there
that was the old movie theatre when we were kids if i didnt take my sister with me shed scream like a banshee
are you certain she was here when it happened
someone would have heard from her if she wasnt
come in this is a nice surprise
howd it go with your folks
i think i might need to brush up on my japanese
i doubt it we got the new upgrades for the universal translator
thatll make life a whole lot easier
itll never replace a linguist with a magical ear
not so magical
well thats a matter of opinion
languages of the subsahara im surprised youre leaving that one here
i havent read it yet
so why not take it with you
captain im sending these books home to my mother itll give me more shelf space theres been a lot written about alien languages since weve been gone
and the clothes are going to
my mother thought it was time to upgrade my civvies
i thought you were leaving
why would you think that
i dont know youre a teacher an academic
and that means im not capable of handling myself on the new mission
thats not what i meant
i dont know whats inside this expanse sir but i think ive proven that i can handle myself in difficult situations and even provide a little help along the way i assume you have no problem with my remaining on board
i wouldnt have it any other way
the nx02
shell be ready to launch in fourteen months
a long time
hopefully youll be back well before then
hopefully what kind of armaments will she have
the same complement of weapons that youll have once the retrofit is done have you told your crew
this morning
how many are staying aboard
some havent decided yet but i dont think more then eight or nine will be leaving i talked to general casey a few hours ago
his team should be arriving at eighteen hundred hours i was surprised you asked for them you think youll be comfortable with the military on board
i dont have a problem with nonstarfleet personnel the general tell me these are the best he has im going to need all the muscle i can get when we cross into the expanse
you werent told where in this expanse you were supposed to look
not even a hint
this weapon theyre building did he say how long it was going to take them
i didnt think he would have warned us if we didnt have a chance of stopping them
subcommander is there something i can do for you
are you confident with your decision doctor
what decision would that be
to remain on enterprise crewman fuller just told me a shuttles on its way with two hundred snow beetles
they could be for my replacement
there isnt a doctor in starfleet that would have the slightest idea what to do with them
and what about you
the high command has made it clear that they dont want me to enter the delphic expanse
im much more interested in hearing what you want
its not my place to disobey the high command
nonsense youve done it before its interesting you and i the only aliens on board this vessel to go or to stay for me it was a simple question of loyalty towards the captain and the sad realisation that hell need me more then ever on such a crucial mission but for you its a more difficult decision does your allegiance lie with the high command or with captain archer
this just arrived doctor
ah
thank you doctor
photonic torpedoes their range is over fifty times greater than our conventional torpedoes and they have a variable yield they can knock the comm array off a shuttlepod without scratching the hull or they can put a three kilometre crater into an asteroid
how long is it going to take to reconfigure the tubes
weve got three teams working on it they promise me itll be done before we leave spacedock but ive got to start integrating them into the power grid
lets go
is there going to be some kind of service
for lizzie if youre talking about a funeral its kind of pointless when theres nothing left
i guess i was talking about a memorial
my sister wasnt big on memorials
i read there was a day of remembrance for all the victims a couple of months ago im sorry you missed it
why are you so obsessed with memorials
im not obsessed
shes dead so are seven million others she was no more important than any of them
she was more important to you there nothing wrong in admitting that
im getting real tired of you telling me what i can and cant do and while were at it i dont need you to remind me that elizabeth was killed so just let it alone maybe you should pay more attention to upgrading your weapons so you can blow the hell out of those bastards when we find them
with all due respects admiral what is the point of me watching this is it supposed to frighten me make me change my mind about commanding this mission
its important for you to see what youll be facing the vaankara was in the delphic expanse for less then two days when we received a distress call this transmission arrived six hours later
less then an hour later the vaankara was destroyed there was no indication of a malfunction or an attack
are you suggesting the crew was responsible
im suggesting you reconsider this mission
is there anything else sir
i need to speak with you tpol
if all goes well you should be able to return to your duties on earth within a year that is if youre still interested you havent been back to vulcan for some time you may find your assignment at the ministry of information refreshing
i dont understand why i cant stay in san francisco
youve spent far to much time with humans it would be best if you returned home for a while
you thought it was crucial to place a vulcan on enterprise during its first mission why not now
you were there to provide logic to a crew of humans who insisted on leaving before they were ready but logic cant help them inside the delphic expanse
can you be certain of that
the high command was quite specific youre to return to vulcan
i believe that should be my decision
this is not the matter of choice defying the high command would mean immediate dismissal you know that
soval agreed to let us take her back to vulcan if its all right with you
its not that far out of your way hows that last refit team doing
scheduled to be done by oh six hundred
i could tell you there are a lot of people counting on you but i dont need to do that do i
no sir
good luck jon
have they gone to warp
not yet
charge weapons and prepare to bring them online
its bad enough one of us is up in the middle of the night
hows porthos holding up if no people have returned from the delphic expanse i doubt any dogs have
he must be doing better then we are hes fast asleep
you picked a new science officer
no
youre gonna miss her arent you
when they first assigned her i felt like strangling soval
she does kind of grow on you
i would think youd be the first one to show her to the airlock
nah to henry archer i wonder what he would have thought if he knew his engine was gonna help save the human race
when i got this job commanding the first warp five ship was about as big as a responsibility as i could imagined then we began running into so many bad guys and i had to start thinking more about the safety of eighty three people
and now the stakes have gotten a lot bigger
weight of the world trip
literally i cant wait to get in there captain and find the people who did this and tell me we wont be tiptoeing around none of that noninterference crap tpols always shoving down our throats maybe its good thing shes leaving
well do what we have to do trip whatever it takes
its duras
youve been wanting to test those new torpedoes
what yield
start low we just want to get them off our backs
what was that
antimatter warheads
increase shielding and target their weapon ports
theyre still on our backs sir
bring the yield up fifty percent
i told you to target the weapons port
their hull platings been enhanced
our warp drive is failing
theyre dropping to impulse
stand down weapons sir
how long will it take them to repair their engines
impossible to determine
give me an educated guess
three hours possibly more
whats our speed
warp three sir
go to four five if we can make it to vulcan space before they get their engines back theyll think twice about giving us any more trouble
come in
ensign mayweather says were two days from vulcan
why dont you sit down  just think in two days youll be eating real vulcan food
chefs done an adequate job of approximating vulcan cuisine
well you never did care for the way we smelled at least you wont have to put up with that anymore
ive gotten use to it
how about all those emotions we bombard you with every day
ive grown accustomed to that as well somewhat
youre not making this easy theres got to be something youre looking forward to back home
i dont wish to return to vulcan
what
i want to remain aboard enterprise if youll allow me to
its not a question of my allowing you the high command would never agree to it
ive decided to resign my commission
why youve worked so hard tpol
youre taking enterprise into a very dangerous place this is no time for me to leave
well be all right
youll need a science officer whether shes a member of the high command or not
ive been thinking about who to promote
you need me captain
keeping away from those klingons isnt going to be easy as we thought
sir
were not going to vulcan mister mayweather set course for the delphic expanse
aye sir
distance
nearly a million kilometres
looks a hell of a hell of a lot closer than that
a common mistake when viewing something of this size
magnify
not very helpful
its not that dense all the way through is it
the vulcans said the expanse is surrounded by thick layers of thermobaric clouds when their last ship went in it took them almost six hours to get through it anything on long range sensors
nothing beyond the perimeter
point two impulse travis lets head in
anything
nothing yet
weve been in here for more then six hours
lets be patient
we launched the communications buoy sir we got a test signal through to starfleet
keep them apprised of our position
aye sir
got something
yes
probably the buoy
not unless you launched three of them
the targeting scanners wont lock on
then get closer
i thought you said the klingons wouldnt go into the expanse
were not in the expanse yet hold your course go to full impulse
i wouldnt recommend that captain the intake manifolds are having a tough enough time as it is
you heard me travis
theyre keeping up with us sir
were being hailed
put it up
surrender or be destroyed
go to hell
youre outgunned archer come about and be prepared to be boarded if you dont obey my orders ill
the perimeter clouds are dissipating im detecting clear space ahead
thats why duras wants us to come about hes afraid of the expanse increase speed travis
the other ships are going to turn back
cowards well do it ourselves
were too close to the expanse
only one left sir
keep firing
the expanse is less than five minutes away
maybe hell turn around like his friends
i wont bet on it your new torpedoes arent having the same effect as last time
duras has transferred his aft shields forward our weapons cant penetrate them
we just lost three antimatter injections captain any more and were in big trouble
if hes transferred his shielding forward whats protecting his stern
does it matter hes chasing us
whats protecting his stern
minimal shielding
think you can pull off an l4 at this speed
i can try sir
then look for the densest cloud formation you can find captain archer to all hands hold on
captain
looks good to me
where are they
fire
nice going travis
i hope you dont ask me to do that too often sir
the expanse is ahead captain
did you lose any more of those injectors
no sir were good to go
sure you still want to tag along
its only logical
straight and steady mister mayweather lets see whats in there
theres been an attack on earth weve been recalled
the probe was sent by the xindi they learned that their world would be destroyed by humans in four hundred years
is there going to be some kind of service
my sister wasnt big on memorials
she was no more important than any of them
she was more important to you theres nothing wrong with admitting that
are you suggesting this is a xindi
id sure as hell like to find out
youre to return to vulcan
i believe that should be my decision
we received a distress call every crewman had been anatomically inverted their bodies splayed open and they were still alive
i want to remain aboard enterprise ive decided to resign my commission
do you think youll be comfortable with military on board
i dont have a problem with nonstarfleet personnel im going to need all the muscle i can get when we cross into the expanse
i cant wait to get in there captain to find the people who did this and tell me we wont be tiptoeing around none of that noninterference crap tpols always shoving down our throats
well do what we have to trip
it could simply be a coincidence
youre being naive their planet is fifty light years away it is not a coincidence
how do you know your contacts gave you accurate information
its the beginning of an invasion hundreds of earth ships will follow
they have no way of knowing that we launched the probe
we must destroy the vessel
how many humans are aboard
it doesnt matter they must be destroyed before they find the weapon
when will it be ready
the next series of tests is being prepared
you will accomplish nothing if all you do is run tests
we must be patient we must follow the plan that we all agreed to
our future is at stake this council mustnt be divided
learn everything you can about this human vessel
how long till we get there
another three hours
did the freighter captain say who we were supposed to contact
the foreman of the north mine hes expecting us
what makes this captain so certain that the miners is xindi
hes not he just said he thinks there was a xindi aboard a transport he took there a few years ago
and it is safe to enter orbit there are no security considerations
he didnt mention any
with all due respect sir we should approach with caution the freighter captain was of questionable character
where are we malcolm
sir
this room what did it used to be
a storage bay sir conduit housings i believe
but it got retrofitted starfleet went to a lot of trouble to turn it into our new command centre why is that malcolm
because of our mission sir
to find the xindi right
right
so this state of the art equipment was put in here to help us gather all the pieces of the puzzle figure out whos trying to destroy earth
right
six weeks weve been in this expanse for six weeks what data have we gathered what pieces of the puzzle have we started to put together not a single one we dont have the luxury of being safe or cautious any more and if the only lead we can find comes from a freighter captain of questionable character then thats good enough for me understood
understood
is this seat taken
maam
im hoshi sato
weve familiarised ourselves with all the bridge officers ensign im major hayes this is sergeant kemper corporals romero and chang
military assault command
captain archer wanted the best
you seem to have all gotten your space legs
some of us are still visiting doctor phlox every morning
the wonders of modern medicine
what do you think of our doctor sergeant i imagine you dont run into many denobulans in duluth minnesota
actually im stationed outside of atlanta no denobulans but we have our fair share of alien visitors you must have gone pretty deep into our records i havent lived in duluth since junior high school
you may have left duluth but youve still got plenty of duluth left in your inflections
excuse me
ensign satos a linguist kemper you give her enough time she could probably tell you what street you grew up on
do you have any idea where were headed ensign
im sure captain archer will let us know when he has reason to
lets hope its soon the quicker you folks find these xindi the quicker we can get to work we have a briefing in a few minutes if youll excuse you
just bay two
yes sir cargo bays one and three seem unaffected
when did it start
about ten minutes ago ensign mcfarlane got pretty banged up but hes going to be okay
youre sure its not a problem with the gravplating
trust me captain its not the gravplating
careful sir stay close to the door theyre scaring me
youre right its not the gravplating any volatile material in those containers
i would have known by now
seal it off lets hope this little anomaly doesnt last any longer than the others did
come look at this the pigmentation is far more colourful that i would have suspected
what are we looking at
xindi epithelial cells harvested from the corpse they found inside the crashed probe
it looks more like scales
precisely when im finished constructing my physiometric profile i wouldnt be surprised to find he has reptilian characteristics
you wanted to see me
do you have any siblings
no
commander tucker had one sister she was killed in the attack
im aware of that
hes having difficulty dealing with the loss
its to be expected
more specifically its affecting his sleep ive been giving him sedatives but id like to see him start tapering off
im not sure i understand
i believe the commander would be a fine candidate for vulcan neuropressure
i doubt the commander would have the patience to sit in one place long enough to get through the first posture
im certain with your delicate guidance
delicate is not a word i associate with mister tucker the instruction of neuropressure is a very intimate act
and hes suffered a very intimate loss he needs your help
have him come to my quarters
theres one little problem assuming that youd agree to my request i suggested all of this to commander tucker earlier today and he was less than enthusiastic
i dont understand
perhaps if i could get him to go to your quarters you might be able to convince him of the lasting benefits of vulcan neuropressure
we should have worn ev suits
the doctor said it was safe for short periods
safe you call this safe ive been in
try not to breathe
yes sir
im captain archer of the starship enterprise weve come to see your
this way
archer
im jonathan archer this is lieutenant reed
ive been told you might be able to make it worth my while if i were to arrange a certain introduction
depends what you mean by worth your while
ive always had a fondness for platinum specifically in its liquified state
im afraid we dont carry precious metals on board
pity
im sure theres something else we could offer you
i dont make a habit of allowing people to interrupt my workers xindi or otherwise
what about the antimatter relays
their linings are coated with a platinumcobalt alloy trip could probably strip them down and separate the metals
how much platinum are we talking about
well im a reasonable man im sure you could part with say half a litre
id need to see this man scan him confirm that hes xindi
that wont be necessary
why would you do this
unfortunate accident i expect to see you back tomorrow
good day
elizabeth lizzie youve got to get out of there
elizabeth please get out of there
a blood sample would have sufficed some saliva
is it xindi
yes and no
i need something a little more concrete doctor
the genetic profile is nearly identical to the tissue samples taken from the corpse found on earth their base pair sequencing is far closer than say humans and chimpanzees nearly identical but not quite
like humans and neanderthals
a reasonable analogy after analysing the remains of the xindi corpse i was able to provide the computer with enough data to create this rendering however this humanoid is reptilian that finger is not its covered with skin not unlike yours or mine but its xindi all the same i wish i could be more helpful captain
sir
hows it coming
were going to end up stripping more than two hundred relays to get half a litre of liquified platinum but youll have it by this afternoon
let me know when its ready you okay
im fine
ive got to have something stronger to help me sleep tonight doc
very well come by at around twenty two hundred hours ill see what i can do
thanks
youre aware this stuff is volatile above thirty degrees celsius
im familiar with the properties of liquid platinum
ive insulated the outer container it should keep everything pretty stable
theres a little more than a half litre in here
what exactly do you want with our xindi friend hes not very attractive especially after his recent surgery
i have something to discuss with him
and what might that be
i brought you what you asked for now let me see the xindi
his work group should be awake in about an hours time
it took six of my men half the night to extract this platinum i think you could wake him an hour early
is trelliumd the only thing you mine here
the only thing trelliumd
im not familiar with it whats it used for
insulation mostly for interstellar vessels what insulation does your ship use captain
our outer hull is lined with duranium
i imagine you must have a very large crew
and why would you imagine that
take your time
do i have you to thank for this
the foreman said it was an accident
did he what do you want
youre xindi
nine fingered xindi what do you want
wheres your homeworld
you came all the way to this hideous planet bribed the foreman to see me for what directions to my planet i find that hard to believe
we have important business with your people
but you dont know where to find them
well if you want information youre going to have to help me escape from this place
what do you mean escape
do these look like volunteers were captives slaves
a simple set of coordinates thats all i want im prepared to pay you
the only payment im interested in is my freedom if you cant provide me with that stop wasting my time
i dont know what youre doing in this place and i dont particularly care but we didnt come here to stage a prison break so why dont you just give us the coordinates and well all stop wasting each others kind
not until you get me off this planet
you know im not sure why but im just itching to kick the hell out of you
trip take it easy  archer here
captain
there are three warships approaching at warp their hull alloys match the mining towers on the surface
how long before they get here
two hours sir
go to tactical alert were heading back to the shuttlepod
understood
shuttlepod you have a starship in orbit youve made it so easy for them usually they have to go out and find ships to replenish their labour force  you flew right into their trap
archer to enterprise enterprise respond
you might consider waiting for your colleagues to rescue you but it sounds like theyre about to become quite busy if you have a shuttlepod on the surface i can get you to it but youll have to take me with you
theres an audio message coming in from the mine foreman
this is enterprise
im afraid your captain
and his associate are going to be slightly delayed we have three cargo vessels approaching and weve had
to begin deionising our landing decks
how long a delay
no more than an hour
weve detected your cargo ships theyre heavily armed
trelliumd is a highly
valued substance and im certain youve noticed that this is not one of the friendlier regions of space
can i talk to captain archer
not at the moment he requested to speak to a miner who resides on level twenty two
i spoke with him a few minutes ago
the deionising process prevents us with communicating with the lower levels ill have him
contact you as soon as he returns
keep trying to reach the captain
something doesnt smell right
i want you to come up with a plan to recover the captain and commander tucker have it in place in one hour get major hayes to help you
sewage takes on a whole new meaning when it comes from a dozen different species
thirty one to be exact help me with this theres a lever below your knees pull it up
plasma duct thirteen hasnt been used since ive been here
why is there a hatch here
theres one every eight levels
what are you doing
opening the emergency baffle up there its a steel plate that locks into place during maintenance cycles follow me
looks a little close to the mine but i suppose itll be all right
the ionised particles will cover our descent itll be all right
have you heard from the captain
not yet the foreman isnt responding to our hails
the ships
less than an hour away are you ready
theyre armed to the teeth down there but it is doable we only have one bone of contention the major here thinks my security team is far to valuable to bring down and put in the line of fire he wants to take his men
its a simple matter of priorities if those warships get here before we return from the surface you could find yourselves dealing with a boarding party youd be in far better hands with a security force who knows enterprise inside and out
i plan to have my men back on board with the captain and trip long before those ships arrive
with all due respect sir we cant be certain of that
the decision is yours lieutenant but i agree with major hayes your team may not be back in time
select six of your men and meet me in launch bay one ill be commanding the mission
very good sir
coming from a military family ive seen men like hayes all my life
lieutenant
that had nothing to do with who knows enterprise inside and out it had to do with who the major thinks is more capable of carrying out this rescue
theyre gone all three of them
thats impossible
weve searched the entire cell perimeter
post guards at their landing craft if they get back to their starship ill lose nearly a hundred new workers
if this leads to the surface why didnt you use it before
the residue in the atmosphere is at least thirty times more toxic than it is down here this is the first time ive had the luxury of a ship waiting for me
the lower levels are hypersaturated with ionised particles so youll have to get within a hundred metres to pick up their biosigns
weve got less than a half an hour to do it
duct thirteen theyve opened two emergency baffles
theyre nearly to the surface we should destroy their landing pod
no too valuable how long would it take to redirect the plasma flow into that conduit
ill see to it
youve risked your lives to learn where my homeworld is because you say you have important business with my people which species have you ever even met a xindi before today
one and he didnt look very much like you
not all of them do there are five distinct species of xindi and five distinct opinions on which one is dominant
what was that
that sounded an awful lot like those emergency baffles we opened
why would they open the rest theyll just help us escape
i thought you said this duct isnt used anymore
it isnt theyve obviously rerouted the plasma
how far up to the next maintenance hatch how far
i dont know
i think the safest bet is to head back down to the last one
i think youre right
thats where the plasmas coming from we should go up
suit yourself
its too late well be killed
shut up just shut up
were going to have to pick up the pace gentleman
wait a minute
get out of my way
what the hell
you stupid son of a bitch i ought to open this hatch and throw you down into
they forced me to come with them they said theyd kill me if i didnt just now this one he tried to throw me into the plasma said they didnt need me any more thank you thank you if you hadnt been waiting here i dont know what i
pick him up
id have preferred having you join your crewmembers as new additions to my workforce but youve turned out to be more trouble than youre worth select a detail take them to the surface shoot all three of them
you okay
yes sir
nice shot
captain it took a little doing sir but we got through the outer hatch
where the hell do you think youre going
you promised to take me away from here
that was before your little performance back there
no please you have to help me
you had your chance
the coordinates of my homeworld if you want them youll have to take me with you
youre lying
no i promise you
reed to mayweather
go ahead
weve got them lock onto my location and set down
understood
fayette go
captain
both shuttlepods have left the surface
is everybody aboard
everybody plus one
the warships
still at warp four eta approximately seven minutes
tell the pods to dock simultaneously prepare to go to maximum warp
come in
im terribly sorry captain but there was nothing i could do i realise how important it would have been to have a xindi to help us
he wasnt a particularly helpful xindi doctor
youd be surprised it was extremely difficult and painful for him to speak but he managed to dictate this to me before he died he said youd know what it meant
ill be damned theyre the coordinates
i must have been in the shower for two hours and i still had that crap in my hair and under my nails
we cleared bioscan thats all that matters
yeah the two new guys that got hurt are they okay
the doctors got them back in their quarters already
youve got to admit their team did a pretty impressive job down there nothing your guys couldnt have done just as well
im not so sure about that see you in the morning
all right
how are you feeling commander
tired you said youd give me something to sleep
very well
if you wouldnt mind commander i promised tpol id take these bioscans to her quarters but i still have quite a bit of work to do here
no problem doc thanks
sickbay to tpol
yes doctor
commander tucker is on his way to your quarters he believes i just gave him a sedative but it was only a placebo hes had a rather difficult day i believe you have your work cut out for you
sorry to drop by so late but phlox said you were expecting this
thank you please sit down
i dont think id be very good company right now anyway i still have a few more showers to take before i get all this trelliumd off me
would you like a cup of tea
thanks but it might keep me up the doctor just gave me a sedative
you are having trouble sleeping as well
i never would have pegged you for an insomniac
i believe the expanse has been disrupting my rem patterns
probably nothing a good hypospray couldnt cure
vulcan science teaches us to prompt our bodies to create their own medicines
so why are you still having trouble sleeping
the neural nodes that need to be stimulated are difficult to reach perhaps you could help me
i dont really know if i can
three centimetres on either side of the fifth vertebrae
you can apply considerable pressure
im not sure which of these is
right there
right here
a little closer together harder harder
if i push any harder ill knock you over
just like that please continue ahhh that was far more effective than a hypospray
glad to be of assistance
it would be only fair for me to return the favour please disrobe
im really flattered subcommander and dont think under different circumstances i wouldnt jump at the chance
are you implying im making sexual advances
no no no no not at all i i was just you see the doctor gave me this sedative and i think its starting to work
the doctor injected you with a placebo he sent you here because he wanted me to persuade you to try vulcan neuropressure as i predicted it was a pointless exercise
why didnt he just ask me
he did you refused
oh so this whole thing was just a set up
the doctor knows how intransigent you can be
intransigent
unwilling to compromise
i know what it means but it just so happens its not true im as willing to compromise as anyone else
then take off your shirt
sir were approaching the coordinates
tactical alert stand by weapons any indications that were being scanned
no sir no vessels no signs of technology nothing
how many inhabited planets
im not detecting any planets inhabited or otherwise
son of a bitch lied to us
phlox said the xindi used his dying breath to give us these coordinates why would he lie
sir im picking up a debris field
a ship
its a lot bigger than that
put it up
its nearly eighty million kilometres long it was a planet
move us in closer
how long ago did this happen
judging by the field dispersion approximately one hundred and twenty years
im pretty sure there was a population here captain im picking up refined metals and traces of alloys some of them match the hull of the xindi probe
theyre building a weapon planning to annihilate earth because they think were going to destroy their world in four hundred years how is that possible if their world doesnt exist anymore hasnt existed for decades
we know the probe that attacked earth was built somewhere in this expanse and it was built recently its logical to assume the new weapon is being developed at the same location
but if its not here
prepare to go to warp four
what course sir
deeper into the expanse
long range sensors are showing increasing numbers of spatial distortions
you heard me travis
they scanned the debris and left nearly three hours ago
their heading
toward the orassin distortion fields
then its unlikely theyll survive
we cant assume that im sending vessels to destroy them
if they are the first wave of an invasion it would be best for us to remain hidden let them keep searching
hes correct they wont find what theyre looking for
finish the weapon quickly or ill destroy the earth ship whether this council approves or not
come here
whats the problem
commander
this cant be right did you run a diagnostic
twice
lets check those relays
captain to the bridge
were getting reports of anomalies from all over the ship
the warp fields fluctuating
bridge to engineering report
i dont get it captain half the plasma relays have reversed polarity
shut down the reactor
im trying but its not cooperating
were losing main power
now
ive restored emergency power but of our primary systems are still offline including weapons
trip whats your status
weve got a hell of a mess down here captain its going to be a while before i can even figure out what just happened
keep me posted
sir im picking up a vessel eight million kilometres off port
whats their heading
looks like theyre holding position or they could be adrift
hail them
our transceivers offline
whats our best speed
one quarter impulse
set a course
biosigns
none and theres no atmosphere aboard artificial gravitys down as well
any sign of what happened to them
no sir
have you spent much time in gravity boots corporal
i did a six week tour on jupiter station the gravplating went down a few times
only in simulation sir
same here captain
this is an alien ship were boarding we could run into magnetic variances watch your step
yes sir
were looking for anything that could tell us what happened to them
and dont forget just because sensors didnt pick up any biosigns doesnt mean you wont encounter anyone
set weapons to stun
aye sir
weapons fire
captain  no external injuries
lets find the bridge
try to access that station download what you can
we counted seventeen bodies most of them died when their life support ran out the others were killed by particle weapons whats our status
ensign sato managed to bring the transceiver online but other than that
archer to mayweather
go ahead captain
resume our previous course one quarter impulse
understood
it might be best to complete repairs before we head deeper into the expanse if we encounter any more anomalies
those people have been dead for less than two days whoever attacked them could still be nearby well have to make repairs on the move mister reed recovered some data from their bridge see what you can make of it
lets try it again watch that intermix ratio
looking good bring her up to forty percent
shut it down shut it down
hows it coming
could be better creating a stable warp field isnt easy when the laws of physics wont cooperate the cochrane equation its not constant here the problems in the quantum variables every time i try to compensate the spatial gradients get thrown out of whack either we get away from these anomalies or were going to have to rewrite the book on warp theory and i dont have to tell you how long it took zefram cochrane the first time around
what about tactical systems
weapons should be up and running within an hour or two
make them your priority
you worried about something
weapons trip as quickly as you can
now wheres isaac newton when you need him
distance
three thousand metres and closing
theyre charging weapons
can you give me hull plating
im sorry sir
hail them
two thousand metres
hold your fire are those warheads armed
yeah
stun grenade
go how many more
two in cargo bay one four more in engineering
get down there and help trip corporal
woods youre with me
theyre trying to download our database
lock them out
increase his anaprovaline by fifty milligrams
how are they
stable however theyve suffered extensive disruptor burns id like to start them on regeneration therapy but the imaging chamber was damaged in the attack ill need a repair team as soon as possible
understood
crewman fuller i did everything i could
what about him
a few internal injuries ill need to keep him under observation
you can observe him in the brig see to it
aye sir
you might be interested to know that i recognise his species hes osaarian
hes not from the expanse
not originally
how bad is it
they made off with three photonic torpedoes a case of plasma rifles two dozen stun grenades chef says they cleaned out half of the food stores cargo bay twos been stripped to the bulkheads but thats not the worst of it they took every one of our antimatter storage pods all weve got left is whats in the main reactor
how long will that last a month
tops after that were out of gas
this is all youve got
high command hasnt had much contact with the osaarians they have a large merchant fleet but theres no record of piracy
any luck tracking their ship
not yet theyve found a way to mask their ion trail
for a people with no history of piracy theyve gotten pretty good at it keep looking
it appears theyve adapted their weapons and engines to compensate for the anomalies pursuing them will be dangerous we should consider other alternatives
such as what waiting for our antimatter to run dry
im only suggesting that we may be able to replenish our supplies elsewhere
keep looking
open it
doctor phlox said your injuries were minor please get up
why
i have a dead crewman
i didnt kill him
no one of your friends did but i dont have one of your friends i have you so get up and look at me  thank you youre going to help me find your ship and after ive taken back what they stole from me you and your colleagues are free to go
if you went anywhere near that ship youd have more than one dead crewman i cant help you even if i could my captain wouldnnt be very interested in having me back would he not after i told you where to find him
thats a risk youll have to take because the alternative is going to be a lot less pleasant
i dont think youd be very comfortable torturing another man you and your crewmates are far too civilised for that too moral
i need what was stolen from me theres too much at stake to let my morality get in the way
youre obviously new to this expanse if you werent your ships hull would be insulated with trelliumd do you have any idea what a spatial distortion can do to a ship that is not insulated with trelliumd what it can do to the people inside that ship
you masked your ion trail how
well my captains a very clever man he has to be when youre forced to resort to desperate measures in order to survive you have to be clever you need to know how to hide
so you were forced into piracy
when we entered this expanse we were no different than you two merchant ships looking for trade routes then the first distortion hit us we decided to return home but the perimeter the thermobaric clouds let you in but they dont let you out one of our ships was destroyed trying after a few more encounters with the anomalies it wasnt long before we became predators this section of the expanse proved to be ideal for hunting when a ship runs aground due to spatial distortions it becomes an easy target our captain told us we wouldnt harm anyone and we didnt not at first it takes time to learn to kill without remorse youre not prepared to kill or torture not yet
im prepared to do whatever it takes to find your ship and if that ends up causing me remorse then its something im willing to live with think about it
ive been studying the data recovered from the derelict apparently they decided to look for the osaarians as well they found a way to modify their sensors to detect the ion trail their life support failed before they had a chance to start
did they leave a record of the modifications
ive already given it to ensign mayweather
whats our tactical situation
hull platings back online we should have phase cannons within the hour
torpedoes
lieutenant reed is still having difficulty modifying the guidance systems to compensate for the anomalies
ill be in the armoury
black tea hot you finished rewriting the physics books
i dont think ill be taking home a nobel prize anytime soon
a few hours rest might do you a world of good
no kidding
you still cant sleep
tpols been trying to help showing me how to stimulate my neural nodes its not what you think
i wasnt thinking anything
how are the weapons coming
the captain and i managed to bring the guidance systems online but were going to need more time for the aft launchers fuller knew those torpedo systems better than anyone he wont be easy to replace considering all the hostile aliens weve met i suppose its fortunate we havent lost more people
i doubt hell be the last
theres no reason to get cynical
every species we run into seems to be gunning for us we might as well paint a giant bullseye on the hull
what do you suggest we do turn around and go back to earth
all im saying is that this mission whether it succeeds or not is looking like a oneway ticket all the time
the trail ends about twenty thousand kilometres ahead
any sign of a ship
nothing
tpol
curious the trail resumes after another seventy thousand kilometres
lets see it
shall i alter course
not yet why would there be such a large gap
their ions may have been dispersed by stellar winds
there would still be some residual particles
captain the particle decay rates dont match this one is at least nine hours old this one was left less than an hour ago
bring weapons online take us to where the first trail ends
travis
im not reading anything
powers fluctuating forward platings down
microfractures are forming on the outer hull we should come about
keep going
tpol
its approximately nineteen kilometres in diameter
ever seen anything like it
no its constructed entirely of a single alloy
who could build something that big
take us in closer
that cloaking field is enormous whoever built this thing went to a great deal of trouble to conceal it
judging from those ion trails the osaarians spent over eight hours here i want to find out why any luck scanning the interior
our sensors are being deflected
see if you can find something that looks like a way in take us into orbit
im detecting what appears to be a portal twenty two degrees north of our current position
put it up
can you tell what the doors made of
polyduranium the same metal as the osaarians hull
can we fit through
not with enterprise
then get a pod ready
weve cycled through the standard frequencies
did you find the locking mechanism
on the lower right side
hold our position
try it now
theres no indication of any ships sir
archer to enterprise
go ahead
were heading in
understood
theres enough energy running through here to power a dozen cities
whats that down there
those modules have a breathable atmosphere
lets hope theres no one home
do you see that docking port ensign
yes sir
were all clear sir
theyve been busy weve a lot of modules to search fan out keep open comm links
theyre not going to run out of stembolts any time soon this way starfleet ration packs
archer
ive found something captain
travis
over here sir
im pretty sure its a cargo manifest
hows your osaarian
not very good sir
download what you can get it to hoshi tell tpol were going to need another search team
aye sir
check behind those canisters
look at this
commander
i had a little accident doc i was reinstalling the deuterium injectors one of them must have had a little juice left in it
second degree burn why dont you have a seat
i could have sworn that injector was depolarised i guess im getting a little punchy
whens the last time you slept
i got a full hour last night
im surprised the neuropressure isnt helping tpol told me your first treatment went well
well we only had the one session havent had a lot of free time lately
are you certain thats the reason
what do you mean
vulcan neuropressure requires a certain degree of intimacy i can understand that it might make you uncomfortable
it doesnt make me uncomfortable i just cant afford to spend an hour every night in tpols quarters can you just give me another one of those injections they put me out like a light
theyre not meant to be taken for extended periods there is another treatment that might be helpful
all right what have you got
aldebaran mud leeches
what am i supposed to do with them
place one on your chest and one on your abdomen an hour before going to bed their secretions act as a natural sedative oh please be careful to sleep on your back if you roll over you might anger them
maybe an hour a night with tpol isnt so bad
the search teams have found nearly eighty percent of our antimatter theyre looking for the rest
its probably running through the reactor of that osaarian ship
weve also recovered most of our weapons
hows trip doing
hell have warp drive online within the next thirty minutes
have the away teams speed it up i want to go to warp as soon as theyre back
quantum scans indicate its nearly a thousand years old
what else
the structure contains seven fusion reactors each one is almost twelve kilometres long only three are still operational
any idea what they were designed for
the spheres emitting massive amounts of gravimetric energy it may have something to do with the spatial anomalies
take as many scans as you can
bridge to captain archer
go ahead
while i was translating the cargo manifest something caught my eye look at these markings i had to doublecheck but i was pretty sure that i had seen this ideography before this is a piece of the xindi probe that crashed on earth at least three of the symbols are an exact match
your ship attacked a xindi vessel i want to know everything you can tell me about them
xindi
you heard me
i dont remember a species with that name
youre lying your manifest said you took their ship less than two weeks ago
what manifest
tell me what you know
it was a small ship they were no match for us
where are they now
you destroyed them
they resisted we had no choice
where did they come from
i have better things to do than familiarise myself with our victims
which species of xindi were they what did they look like
i dont remember
are you sure
your threats arent very convincing i told you youre too civilised
well see about that
sir
as you were
ensign
are you taking me to your torture chamber
shut up
get in
the xindi
this tactic doesnt suit you captain
this airlock has a decompression rate of point five atmospheres per minute
youd better start talking now because in about forty seconds you wont be able to the xindi
captain
everythings under control lieutenant
the airlocks decompressing sir hell die
not for another twenty seconds he wont the xindi
sir
your memory getting any better  say again
captain
take him back to the brig
lets go
was he cooperative
eventually when they attacked the xindi ship they took more than fuel and supplies they downloaded their database how close would we have to get to tap into their main computer
pretty close less than a kilometre but we need to have the access codes
he gave them to me here
they are heavily armed are you sure its wise to engage them
i want that database go to tactical alert tell trip were going to need all the power he can spare for weapons and hull plating
their ion trails already started to decay theyre going to be hard to find
were going to wait for them to find us travis
somethings passing through the cloaking field
move us into position  stand by have they detected us
not yet
open a channel
go ahead
this is captain archer remember us you probably noticed that our weapons are back online youre outgunned so stand down
theyre moving off
one kilometre travis  get ready
hull platings holding
theyre heading back into the cloaking field
stay with them
hoshi
were not close enough
stand by
another fifty metres im into the computer
anything
i havent found the xindi database im losing them
travis
forward hull plating is offline
ive found it captain
how long do you need
a few minutes
hull fracture on e deck section fourteen were venting atmosphere
emergency bulkheads
theyre getting too far away im losing the comm link again
our impulse drives destabilising weve got to get out of the cloaking field sir
head back to the sphere
where are they
still inside the field
how much did you get
about a third of it
take us closer to that portal lets see if we can lure them back in here use our forward phase cannon fire a single burst minimum yield
travis
no sign of them
again
that got their attention theyre coming through
stay within a kilometre return fire
im back in
can you take out their engines
not without risking damage to their main computer
ensign
ive got eighty percent eighty five
hull platings offline theyre targeting our reactor
ive got ninety percent
good enough mister reed
their engines are down
keep our weapons locked on them
your codes worked  get him out of there
now that ive served my purpose youre taking me back to the airlock
escort him to the launch bay were taking you back to the sphere
so you have let your morality get in the way after all mercy is not a quality that will serve you well in the expanse captain
computer load the xindi database
come in
thanks for seeing me so late you sure im not bothering you
not at all
georgia peaches i picked up a crate when we were back on earth chefs been keeping then in stasis for me theyre as fresh as the day they were picked
thank you
arent you going to try one
i dont usually eat this late
come on one bite
this doesnt make up for the two sessions you cancelled
maybe you havent noticed but ive been a little busy lately its not like i didnt want to come back after our last session i slept like a baby first time in months so should i just
please
your shoes as well
shoes
there are many neural nodes in the soles of the feet
hold on you never said anything about feet
is that a problem
well for one thing i havent had a shower since this morning and i know how sensitive that vulcan nose of your can be and im a little ticklish maybe more than a little
ill stop at the first sign of discomfort
oh your hands are ice cold
long deep breaths
you sure this is safe i mean has anyone ever tried it on a human before
not to my knowledge the risk of paralysis is minimal breathe
thats the spot
tpol
its the captain id like you to join me in the command centre right away
sorry if i woke you
i wasnt asleep
look at this
another species of xindi
according to phlox they probably evolved from some form of arboreal primate i managed to piece together some of their starcharts it took me half the night to figure out how they map coordinates but ive been able to reconstruct the ships course over the past few months this is the last planet they visited before they were attacked by the marauders
does it say what they were doing there
no but its only a day away
we dont know if these xindi were involved with the ones who attacked earth
we dont know they werent tell travis to set a course
the ecosystem is prolific there are several million chromophyllic plant species alone
what about xindi
im not detecting any humanoid life but itll take several hours to search all the land masses
captain im picking up a metallic signature at the northern end of those equatorial islands it looks like a landing craft
any bioscans
none within a thirty kilometre radius
now at thirteen kilometres
theres a break in the canopy it should be wide enough
i see it
sir
judging by the oxidation this happened about two weeks ago
right about the time the xindi were here
its definitely one of theirs i recognise it from the database  search the area see what else you can find  some of their databanks may still be intact
captain a body
it isnt xindi at least not one of the three species were familiar with
maybe it was one of the other two
what about him
the readings are the same
this whole areas been scorched
are you all right
i never much care for the tropics
keep looking
lieutenant
captain tpol to enterprise
go ahead
send a security team to the surface were being altered by some kind of
subcommander
stay back
captain untie me let me go
thank you
we have to get back to enterprise enterprise
may i have that the device may i have it
this may help us understand each other youre going to have to talk talk you need to talk
thats a vulcan biosign im certain of it
but these arent human
definitely not
then wheres the rest of our team the only reason i dont have a search party down there right now is because you needed more time to analyse the data now unless you can give me a damn good reason to wait around
when tpol called to the ship she said something was happening to them
she said they were being altered
its possible she was speaking literally something on the planet may have transformed them physiologically
youre saying these alien biosigns could be our people
from what weve seen of the expanse its a possibility we have to consider the laws of biochemistry on this world may be just as unpredictable as the laws of physics
whoever they are theyre not staying put theyre heading due east of the landing site
prep shuttlepod two
aye sir
id like a little more time to study these readings
well use ev suits and biohazard protocols have the decon chamber ready when we get back
enterprise
yes its your ship youre the captain
we dont have time for this we have to find urquat its all that matters now
urquat
we have to keep looking its somewhere close
why are you talking to her shes trying to delay us our people are there
they can help us tell us what happened why we cant remember
captain that device i can use it to call enterprise you have a doctor on board he can prove to you what im saying is true
dont trust her shes not one of us
we dont know what she is
urquat you said we need to find urquat we should keep searching
it cant be far
no thank you im not hungry
theyre about three kilometres east of us we dont have too many options for a landing site hope you boys are up for a little walk
its a shuttlepod from enterprise they wont hurt you let me talk to them
keep your weapons on stun circle around
chang
captain wait dont you recognise him
take lieutenant reed back to sickbay
what about you
im staying with them
subcommander
he didnt even recognise me
dont be offended in his current condition i doubt hed recognise any of us
any idea what caused this
a mutagenic virus his blood was swarming with them it was apparently designed to rewrite the dna of its host to transform any humanoid it infected into another species
why did it have so little effect on tpol
vulcan kcells they seem to neutralise the pathogen ive been synthesising an antivirus using tpols genetic profile but im going to need an active sample of her dna to complete it we need to get her back to the ship as soon as possible
im doing my best
bridge to commander tucker
go ahead
two ships just dropped out of warp sir theyre on an intercept course
theyre hailing us
open a channel
your ship is in restricted space
sorry it wasnt very well marked
our scans indicate that one of the people on your ship has been infected with a dangerous virus
were aware of that is there anything you can tell us about
your vessels under quarantine prepare to be boarded
no ones coming aboard unless i say so
the infected organism must be eradicated before the virus can spread
that infected organism is a member of my crew
does he still look like one of your crew does he recognise you or even speak your language anymore weve been studying the mutagen for sixty years the only course of action is to neutralise the outbreak
there isnt any outbreak lieutenant reed is in medical isolation
we wont allow your vessel to leave orbit with the contagion aboard
look weve only been dealing with this virus for one day so forgive me if i dont take your word for it that the only option is to neutralise our tactical officer you want to come over to discuss the situation fine but if you try to force your way onto this ship youre going to have one hell of a fight on your hands
how long was i asleep
only for a few minutes
i saw it in my dream i was there
urquat
our city
there are no cities on this planet
youre wrong its below the surface
tell me what was it like
it was filled with thousands of loqueeque waiting for us
your home is a planet called earth the people there are waiting for you youre on a mission to save them
urquats my home when we get there youll understand wait and see weve rested long enough
the decon chambers sealed i assure you theres no danger
you wouldnt be so confident if you knew how easily this virus can spread it infected tens of millions of people on my world they all had to be destroyed
destroyed
the virus would have transformed our entire population within weeks
where did it come from
it was engineered by the inhabitants of this planet a race called the loqueeque something decimated their species centuries ago and they lost the ability to reproduce so they created this virus to transform other species into their own it was the only way to save themselves from extinction
ingenious but why didnt they programme the virus to stop replicating once their population was replenished
weve been trying to answer that question for a long time
whys he so eager to get back to a place called urquat
the mutagen encodes the victims with an overpowering instinct to return to their home city urquat thats why we cant allow even a single infected organism to leave this planet they can spread the contagion to other systems and anyone who became infected would be drawn back here we cant risk another epidemic  yes
weve detected three more infected organisms on the surface
prepare a containment team more of your crewmen
one of them has an immunity to the virus if i could have access to some of your research perhaps we could work together
we will find these people and examine them if theres anything to report well let you know
id prefer to have doctor phlox examine them
what you prefer doesnt matter im under orders to contain this outbreak if you attempt to interfere im authorised to use any force necessary  take me back to the airlock
if i dont complete the antivirus within the next two hours itll be too late there wont be enough of their original genome left to resequence
we cant launch a shuttlepod theyd detect it do you think tpols contagious
most likely
that rules out the transporter shed infect the entire crew
whatever you do commander do it quickly i need that dna sample
be right back
bridge to commander tucker
go ahead
one of those ships just launched a shuttle sir its heading towards the surface
keep an eye on them
it isnt far now the passage was here in my dream help me
you said theyd be waiting for us
i saw it so clearly there was a fountain there and gardens up there floating and there were people thousands of people
come back to enterprise well help you find out what happened to your city
no no were not leaving this is our home home home
look around these ruins are ancient no one has lived here for a very long time
what about this  this body isnt ancient someone killed them why who would do this your people
no
then who
i dont know but if we go to enterprise we can try to find out
i dont belong on enterprise i belong here
someones coming
more of your humans
i dont think so were not safe here come we must go come we must go
weve found them
take the vulcan woman then destroy the others
understood
who are they
i dont know
you destroyed my city killed my people
captain we have to get to the surface
this way
lower your weapon and move away you wont be harmed
i said move away
you all right
you said youd never use the transporter again
believe me i wish id had a choice there are more of them in orbit wed better get back to the shuttlepod before they realise anythings wrong
captain you cant stay here youll be safe on enterprise
its commander tucker
put him through go ahead sir
were docking travis tell phlox to stand by in decon go to warp four as soon as were in
understood
report
theyre in pursuit two thousand kilometres and closing
try to stay ahead of them stand by weapons
theyre hailing us
dont respond hold your course
nine hundred kilometres
theyre charging weapons
seven hundred
full power to aft hull plating
hull platings down to forty percent
were being hailed again
drop out of warp
look we both want the same thing a cure for this virus right our doctor thinks hes found one but he needs a little more time
i wont warn you again commander were going to contain this outbreak whether you cooperate or not
why are you firing at my ship
there are three infected people on board we wont allow you to leave this system
this is captain archer and ensign sato theyre the people you nearly incinerated on that planet as you can see theyre responding quite well to the antivirus i synthesised
thats not possible
run scans see for yourself
like i said he just needed a little more time im sure wed be happy to share the antivirus with you but thatll be impossible if you destroy our ship
this should help with the headaches
have you got anything for my stomach the chefs food isnt sitting too well
till your digestive tract is fully restored you may want to avoid the mess hall
what do you suggest i eat
youre welcome to some of the moth larvae i feed to my pyrithian bat
how are you feeling lieutenant
not bad sir how about yourself
getting there hoshi and tpol are going to take the day off you might want to do the same
thank you captain i could use a little rest
you wanted to see me
this is the last of the mutagenic virus i assume you want me to destroy it
no
captain you experienced firsthand what this pathogen can do
those containment patrols arent going to stop until theyve wiped out every trace of it now that they have your antivirus theyll most likely figure out a way to succeed
considering the alternatives that would be best
this was created as a final effort to preserve a civilisation a people that species we became they cease to exist the moment this virus is gone
captain
we came out here to stop the xindi destroying humanity ill be damned if im going to have a hand in destroying another race in the process put it on ice doc in stasis whatever understood
how much of the lab was destroyed
nearly all of it three of my researchers were killed
and what of your work degra
i havent been able to assess how much data was lost this will obviously delay us
how long
months perhaps im not certain
the humans have been through our space
they attacked a trellium mine we cannot wait any longer
think what youre asking me to do build a weapon to destroy an entire world do you understand how difficult how dangerous this project is
are you saying youre not up to the task
dissension will solve nothing we knew there could be setbacks
i agree we are too far along to change our plan
besides we have no alternative
you know that isnt true
that option has been discussed and rejected
not by all of us
perhaps it is time to reconsider our colleagues proposal
we do not have enough information about the humans
that can be remedied
its too dangerous
i agree degra deserves more time
but if we do not see some progress soon well have no choice but to consider all our options
is that sufficient pressure
you could go a little harder mmm perfect try that neck thing whatd you call it
the khavorta posture
yeah that one
are you certain
dont worry ive been practicing my breathing
you have been practicing
tpol
dont speak relax your jaw excellent now the surahthan
you know i really need to talk to you about something
is there a problem
no no no i mean this feels great and i really appreciate you taking the time its just im not sure we should be doing it anymore
you said this was helping you sleep
it has
then why do you want to stop
people are talking about us about me coming to your quarters at night they think theres more going on than neuropressure
and that disturbs you
it shouldnt i know but malcolm and i were purging a clogged injector assembly only last week and he asked me why i didnt just massage it with my magic fingers
i see no reason to be concerned with idle gossip
it doesnt bother you
were both senior officers if we were pursuing a romantic relationship it wouldnt be lieutenant reeds concern would it
i suppose not
shall we continue
youve been scratching again
the itching kept me up all night
have you been using the ointment i gave you
i tried but the smell is a little strong
the more you scratch the longer it will take to heal i understand you may have found a source of trelliumd
a vradian chemist we met at the deuterium station claims he knows a way to synthesis it
i hope hes correct crewman cutler broke her arm when one of those spatial anomalies went through the exobiology lab the sooner the ship is insulated against these phenomena the happier i will be
were working on it doctor
of course
have you had any other symptoms
just dreams i keep seeing myself back at that alien city
you were transformed into a different species dont expect to recover overnight
the chemist said his shop was on barge twelve
phlox would have a field day here
im afraid well have to save the souvenir hunting for another time
i dont recognise your species you must be newcomers welcome
thank you were looking for barge twelve a chemist named brat ud
it would be a shame if i let you leave our world without introducing you to the local wildlife
thats not necessary
zentho marmots make wonderful pets and the flesh is quite succulent when prepared properly
no thank you can you direct us to the chemist
barge twelve is that way tier two
im closed
i have an appointment we met at the deuterium station on norellus
youll have to come back later
you said you could sell us the formula to synthesise trelliumd i hope you didnt bring us all this way for nothing
captain archer i remember now how are you
a little pressed for time
of course trelliuma is extremely common easy to synthesise but trelliumd is rare difficult to process
and expensive
im confident we can agree on a fair price i was thinking about you recently captain you were very eager to learn about the xindi as i recall what is your interest in them
were on a diplomatic mission
a diplomatic mission some xindi arrived here last week i thought you might be interested
where can we find them
they had business with another merchant
who
id be happy to direct you for a small fee
commander tucker has the list of supplies and equipment wed be willing to barter as a gesture of good faith why dont you tell me where we can find this merchant then you and mister tucker can work out the details
im confident we can agree on a fair price
do you like what you see
to answer your first question i regret i cannot offer free samples
brat ud said you might be able to help us
i always welcome referrals what is your pleasure
we were told youve recently done business with some xindi
excellent customers they purchased two utani serpent women im afraid i dont have any more but perhaps i could interest you in a nuvian concubine shes quite skilled
were not interested i want to know where we can find these xindi
i believe they left orbit two days ago
where were they heading
i wouldnt stay in business very long if i revealed confidential information about my clients but i have females here from many worlds who knows perhaps one of them can tell you what you want to know about the xindi
you have an excellent eye my friend she can be very accommodating
archer
captain brat and i have agreed on a price ill need to go back to the ship for his payment
understood well meet you back at the shuttlepod
how can you walk away from such beauty
thanks for your time
after an hour in this place i cant wait to get back to decon
stop her
take me with you please
she seems determined to be sold today lets go back to my shop and arrange for payment
i dont think so
then ill take my merchandise
looks like she doesnt want to go with you
if youre so concerned about what she wants buy her otherwise stay out of this
lets get out of here
gladly
you have the most intriguing eyes ive never seen a retinal structure this complex
hows our guest
im not familiar with her species but she appears to be in perfect health
im afraid i dont even know your name
im called rajiin im very grateful for what youve done captain ill serve you well i promise
lets get something straight we dont believe one person can own another person youre free to go wherever youd like how far is your home world
i dont know im told its called orantaku but i dont remember it
do you have any family
ive had many owners
we have some data on this region of space ill see if i can locate orantaku if its possible well take you there  set her up in quarters get her whatever she needs
of course
captain thank you
on our planet wars were fought over these careful
whats this one called
black pepper theres paprika mustard seed im partial to the cayenne myself im sure youll find these all very exotic
i believe you have something for us
of course ive reviewed your engineering specifications you appear to have the necessary equipment to produce liquid trelliumd
liquid
trellium can only be synthesised in a liquid state its just as effective as the natural ore
then all we need is the recipe
there is one thing be sure to follow the protocols precisely
or
lets just say that in its liquid form trelliumd is extremely unstable
how are your accommodations
much better than im used to the last ship i was on i never left the cargo hold except for a few visits to the captains quarters
there are some restricted areas on enterprise otherwise feel free to look around
your crew wont mind
i seriously doubt it
are they all from earth
nearly all youve met doctor phlox hes from denobula my first officers a vulcan
doctor phlox mentioned you were on an important mission
were trying to make contact with a species called xindi i dont suppose you know anything about them
very little the two i saw looked reptilian and they werent very pleasant at the time i was just relieved they werent interested in me why are you looking for them
were hoping to resolve a disagreement
tucker to captain archer
archer
were in business sir
ill be right there excuse me
how unstable
enough to do some serious damage if we screw this up
and were supposed to insulate the entire ship with it
its only volatile in its liquid form once we apply it to the inner hull and it sets its completely safe the tricky parts cooking it up in the first place
itll require extremely precise calculations but i believe mister tucker and i can synthesise the compound safely
get started
i recommend we set up a lab on e deck within the emergency bulkheads as a precaution
come in
good evening captain
is everything all right
im sorry to disturb you i hoped you might have time to talk
er im not quite er please i meant to speak with you earlier we have some good news tpol was able to locate your home planet in a database we acquired its only two days away you dont seem very pleased
i was taken away when i was very young i dont remember much about it and i doubt anyone there would remember me
you never know you seem very memorable to me
im very grateful for what youve done captain i want to repay you for your kindness
that isnt necessary
i know
rajiin you
theres a reason i was taken from my home i have certain gifts would you like me to show you
that really isnt something that i
its all right
captain is something wrong
no
well i just wanted to say thank you again
well be leaving orbit soon
good night
good night
whats the molecular pressure
up to eleven hundred units
boy this stuff is tricky decrease the theta bombardment by six no seven percent
the pressures still rising fourteen hundred units fourteen thirty
damn it kill the theta radiation altogether
no effect we should seal off this section and leave
a sustained burst of delta radiation might do the trick
it might not we should evacuate
im going to ramp the delta at eighty percent
its not working
youre welcome to leave
the pressure is up to two thousand units commander
some of our calculations may have been slightly off
were back to square one
weve been working for six hours i suggest we take a break
i cant argue with that
come to my quarters in half an hour well resume your neuropressure regimen
ill be fine
i prefer you are rested before we make another attempt
can i help you
the captain said it was all right if i left my quarters im rajiin
i know news travels fast on a starship im ensign hoshi sato
its a pleasure to meet you i was looking for the mess hall
i just happen to be going that way
whats your job here
im the ships communications officer
i see
id love to hear your language
actually i speak quite a few
you must be tpol i didnt mean to startle you my names rajiin
i know who you are what are you doing here
your door was unlocked
thats not likely
i was hoping wed have a chance to talk
perhaps you are unfamiliar with our protocols but it is unacceptable for you to be in my quarters uninvited
i didnt think youd mind
im afraid
youre vulcan on a ship filled with humans why
vulcans and humans are allies now please leave what are you doing
dont resist
i need you to leave
you have a disciplined mind youre in such control of your emotions try to let go better
stop
let go
no
tucker to the bridge
go ahead
could you tell me where tpol is
shes in her quarters sir
tucker to security
i need assistance
were you successful
i have what you want i can use their transporter device but youll need to be within ten thousand kilometres
signal us when youre ready
is there something wrong
the captain would like to see you
theres no need to bother the captain
i have my orders
so do i
are you in range respond
leaving so soon
we jammed your signal your friends cant hear you who are they take her to the brig
you should let me run a neural scan
ill be fine what happened to her
i cant even begin to speculate shes suffered disruptions throughout her neocortex if she were human or denobulan for that matter shed probably be dead but vulcan neurophysiology is a great deal more resilient than ours
i want to talk to her
i have to finish treating her injuries first
how long
a few hours
have phlox take a look at your head
who were you trying to contact
im sorry
i asked you a question
i cant answer it
what did you do to tpol
she shouldnt have resisted
who are you
i told you my name is rajiin
thats right kidnapped when you were a child sold into a life of slavery and it was just a coincidence that you happened to escape when i was at that market the chemist knew i was looking for information about the xindi is that why you showed up so conveniently
the only thing i can tell you is that youre in danger
care to be a little more specific
if i say anything else theyll kill me
who the xindi how do you know i wont do the same
its true that i deceived you but that didnt make your decision to help me any less admirable i dont want to see you harmed captain the best thing for you to do is let me go
tell me who you contacted who
bridge to captain archer
go ahead
two vessels are approaching from aft sir
the biosigns match the genetic profile of the xindi pilot who attacked earth
hull plating to full power stand by weapons the reptilian species theyre the ones who sent you
i had no choice
were dropping out of warp
i assume theyre here for you
they wont harm anyone if you let me go
forgive me if i dont take your word on that but they murdered seven million people on my planet
bridge to the captain
go ahead
the smaller ship is approaching the starboard docking port
seal that airlock and post security teams im on my way
what was your mission
they wanted information
about what
about you theyre building a weapon
we know that
this is different a bioweapon
go on
they need data about your species before they can begin
where are they building the weapon
i dont know
when will it be ready
i dont know they didnt tell me anything else
get a security detail down here no ones taking her anywhere
fall back
three boarding parties at least five men each
theyre heading for the brig try to cut them off  youre with me
archer to the bridge
go ahead
dont let those ships get away lay in a pursuit course
aye sir
hes dead sir
captain
those ships just entered some kind of vortex theyre gone
this gland released a fatal dose of neurotoxin into his bloodstream
what kind of species is born with a suicide gland
not this one he was surgically enhanced if you can call it an enhancement
i want a complete autopsy doctor and have malcolm take this weapon apart i want to find out its range power output and how we can defend against it
aye sir
are you okay
yes
good because i want an analysis of the scans we took of those xindi ships and find out what you can about that vortex they went through i dont want them dropping in unannounced again dismissed
you put all of our work at risk
and exposed us to the humans allowed one of your soldiers to be captured
he wasnt taken alive
you agreed to give me more time you dont have enough data to construct the bioweapon
dont we bring her
show them show them
we couldnt pursue the bioweapon because we didnt have enough information about the humans now we do
we must proceed on both fronts
do you expect us to reward you for this act of insubordination this has left us more vulnerable that we were before
theres more to these humans than you can learn from a set of biometric scans
thats enough take her
shes coming to
let me go let me go
stop
ill kill you
were not going to hurt you
you liar no get away from me
the damage is more severe than i expected
can you reverse it
im not certain tpol
whats he doing
its all right hes trying to help you
hes trying to kill me you killed the others murderers get away
i talked with chef at dinner hes a little worried about the crew people are skipping meals he figures theyre either too busy or the stress of this mission is starting to get to them
i havent had much of an appetite myself
movie nights been on hold since we entered the expanse maybe we should start it up again
therell be plenty of time for movies after weve dealt with the xindi
no one hates the xindi more than i do captain but im telling you this crew needs a little r and r unless you want phlox to start medicating people we gotta weve gotta find a way to boost morale
what did you have in mind
i was thinking about a comedy one of the classic hope and crosby pictures
good choice
captain
weve been reviewing some of these xindi star charts trip thought they might be able to help us figure out if there are any more spatial anomalies in the region
i would have helped you do that
its late i didnt want to get you out of bed besides our resident insomniac was looking for something to do
you have plans tuesday night
not at the moment
mess hall nineteen hundred hours
movie night
back by popular demand
 bridge to captain archer
go ahead
im picking up an automated distress call sir its vulcan
have you tried hailing them
several times
im on my way
where are they
three point two light years bearing oh one six mark twelve
i recognise the transponder frequency its the seleya they entered the expanse nine months ago
keep hailing them set a course
the asteroids are moving in a chaotic fashion their paths are unpredictable it may be the result of some spatial anomalies
wheres the vulcan ship
approximately two thousand kilometres dead ahead
i can guess why they were interested in this field the asteroids are loaded with trellium ore
it looks a little too crowded in there for enterprise wake up mister reed tell him to meet us in the launch bay
aye sir
try to get your hands on some of that ore tpol
starboard bow three hundred forty metres
i see it
no damage though we may need a fresh coat of paint
how much farther
twelve hundred kilometres i could take the helm if youd like
maybe on the way back so what else do you know about the seleya
a great deal i served on it for over a year it was my last assignment before joining the consulate on earth i was the deputy science officer under captain voris
any idea what they were doing in the expanse
they were attempting to chart the thermobaric perimeter after several days they reported that theyd become caught in some kind of subspace eddy and were being pulled into the expanse it was their final transmission the vankaara was sent to find them you already know what happened to that crew
lets hope the seleya fared a little better
directly ahead two hundred metres
hang on
good isotope density we should get at least half a kilo out of this one
lets try for something bigger this time how about this one
ive got a lock
travis
theres an overload in the resequencer
shut it down
i cant
this things useless the coils are fused
what if i could put a shuttlepod down on one of the big ones
theyre pretty unpredictable you sure you could land safely
i can try
thisll be a new one for the maintenance crew
main powers offline their hulls taken quite a beating
life support
minimal decks twelve and thirteen have decompressed
im reading multiple biosigns
this is captain archer of the starship enterprise please respond seleya come in
the starboard docking port is still intact
captain they were lining this bulkhead with trellium they didnt get very far
im reading biosigns on this deck i cant isolate them
take starboard
vulcan blood
one biosign
you all right tpol
im fine
his synaptic pathways have been severely damaged
lets get him in the pod
captain
keep back
archer to reed
go ahead sir
have you come across anyone
not yet
watch yourself somethings happened to them theyve become violent
aye sir
lieutenant you okay
what happened to them
seven more that direction thirty metres
captain
lets get out of here
what are you doing
stun isnt working we should set our weapons to kill
these are vulcan officers and were on a rescue mission
with respect maam they dont seem to want our help
you heard me
keep your weapons on stun
yes sir
captain over here
what are they doing
were from the starfleet ship enterprise do you understand me
is there another way to the airlock
no
that way
go go on
archer to enterprise enterprise respond
if their comm systems intact we may be able to contact enterprise from the bridge
where is it
seven decks above us
seven how many vulcans are on board
assuming the entire crew is still alive one hundred and forty seven
if im not mistaken the launch bays on this level maybe we can use one of their shuttles
the bays depressurised probably from an asteroid impact
we have to get back to our pod
thatll be difficult all four bulkheads leading to the airlock have been sealed
we should keep moving hows your arm
its fine sir
hes losing a lot of blood captain weve got to treat this wound
how far to their sickbay
its two decks up
lets go  are you all right
since weve come aboard ive been experiencing anxiety whatevers happened to this crew may be starting to affect me
well get you out of here as soon as we can
this ones more isolated and im reading large deposits near the surface can you set us down
there isnt a flat spot much bigger than my quarters
youre the pilot its your call
lets go im matching the rotational velocity
looking good two hundred metres youre drifting to the left
got it
i hope you wont write that landing up in your log
are you kidding im going to recommend they give you a medal
lets try to make this quick
any idea whats causing this
im not a doctor
but you are my science officer i need to know i can depend on you
ill do my best his name is solin when i served here he was the chief engineer i knew him
can you understand me subcommander tpol we served together dont you recognise me were here to help you but we need to know what happened to your crew solin look at me something has made you very ill youve lost control tell me what happened tell me
this is going to happen to me
you dont know that
its already started i can feel my control slipping away
were getting you off this ship
its too late
were going to take the scans you made back to phlox and figure out whats going on here but first we have to get to the shuttle how do you open those bulkheads the bulkheads
theres an auxiliary control room on the engineering deck
okay
are you okay
tpol we have to keep moving
i dont need your help
two more biosigns fifty metres beyond that hatch its the only way to the engineering deck
well go deal with them stay with her hawkins
aye sir
water no offense but you look like you could use some
thank you
i apologise for the way i reacted before you were right this is a rescue mission may i ask you a question how is it possible that this crew could turn so violent when vulcans arent supposed to have emotions
a common misconception we have emotions we simply keep them suppressed under control something has obviously caused them to lose that control
why would they want to kill us
there was a time in the past when we were an extremely violent race we nearly destroyed ourselves paranoia and homicidal rage were common
five metres
any more where they came from
not at the moment
archer to hawkins
go ahead sir
were all clear
understood were on our way
i heard about the accident you and tpol had in the lab
it was minor nothing to write home about
but youre sure this stuff is safe to bring on board
dont worry it only tends to blow up in its liquid state
enterprise to commander tucker
go ahead
sir weve just picked up a spatial anomaly at your coordinates
we saw it
its altered the course of
the asteroid youre heading into a denser part of the field
grab a seat commander
dont worry about me just get us the hell out of here
the starboard thrusters failing
theres debris in the intake manifold can you purge it
were clear weve only got one thruster left
can you get us home
i think so
shuttlepod two to enterprise
go ahead commander
were on our way back but weve taken damage
alert the launch bay crew to get ready for a rough docking
understood
secure the door
the transceivers been damaged
any chance of repairing it tpol
what
any chance of repairing it
theres an auxiliary transmitter if i can get access to it we may be able to contact enterprise
sir ive encrypted the locking codes but if theyre determined to get in
looks like the impulse assembly took a beating open up the engine housings and run a diagnostic
bridge to commander tucker
tucker here
were receiving a transmission from the captain it sounds urgent
route it down here
go ahead captain
trip
were going to need some help getting off this ship how fast can you be here
pod two took some damage in the asteroid field sir were looking at a couple of hours before we can launch again
whats the problem
its the vulcan crew somethings wrong with them
were going to transmit some biodata
tell phlox to start analysing it see if theres anything we can do to help these people
acknowledged anything else
just get that shuttle flying
aye sir
archer out
you heard the captain get a repair team down here
the bulkhead controls were severed on deck nine ive rerouted them through the auxiliary grid mister reed are you finished with those actuator circuits
theyve all been realigned
you okay
what did you do
i realigned the circuits just like you asked me
these arent sequenced correctly you overloaded the locking mechanism
then well have to try something else
its pointless the circuits are damaged i should have been watching him you didnt want me to see now i know what you were doing in the command centre
what are you talking about
the xindi starcharts you were analysing them behind my back undermining my work
no ones trying to sabotage your work we should all just focus on getting off this ship safely
there might be another way sir if we overload the power grid it would disrupt the systems all over the ship including the bulkhead mechanisms
the warp reactor is unstable as it is disrupting main power could shut down the antimatter containment youd cause a reactor breach
i dont think we have much of a choice
you want to kill all of us  you dont trust vulcans you never have
sir that pistols set to kill
give me the weapon
dont think ive forgotten you blamed us for holding you back for undermining your fathers work now youve decided to take revenge  ill fire
listen to me this is a rescue mission were here to save these people
youre lying you want to kill them
if thats true then why would i keep our weapons on stun its not logical
it doesnt make sense tpol and i have been working with trellium for weeks she hasnt shown any symptoms
i dont imagine she would have despite your best efforts you werent able to synthesis it in any significant quantities the crew of the seleya however had the misfortune of wandering into an asteroid field filled with the compound trelliumd is a potent neurotoxin to the vulcan nervous system it disrupts the synaptic pathways that allow them to control emotions unfortunately the rate of decay is accelerating
is it too late
i can treat her but i nee to begin synaptic regeneration as soon as possible
what about the vulcan crew
phlox do you read me
im afraid theres nothing we can do for the others theyve been exposed for too long the neurological damage is irreversible theyre dying captain
hes lying he wants them all to die
doctor there are over a hundred and forty people on this ship
im sorry but theyve been exp
enterprise phlox do you hear me respond
theyve shut the comm system down
captain theyre flooding the compartment with hexafluorine
shut it off
i cant theyve bypassed the environmental controls
they wont let you destroy this ship
after you initiate the overload how long do we have
about fifteen minutes maybe less
no
you heard what the doctor said they cant be saved but you can
murderer
help me get her out of here
malcolm
just about there
come on climb
malcolm
we dont have much time
no no no
you cant stay here
another twenty metres
captain
how were you at the long jump
watch her reed
come on you can make it
get away from me
its okay ill help you
touch me and ill kill you
go i said go
give me a hand
whats wrong
i cant release the docking clamps full power to thrusters
were being hailed
are you all right captain
the docking
clamps are jammed we could use a hand
stand by
youre clear sir
the ships about to blow get the hell out of here
archer to shuttlepod two are you still in one piece
were fine sir see you back on enterprise
we got over   sixty kilos that should be enough to line the forward hull
it may be a while before phlox finds a way to inoculate tpol take this to cargo bay one store it in the biohazard locker
aye sir
howd it go
you got her out in time captain her synaptic pathways are mending nicely but it will be a few days before she fully regains control of her emotions
id like to talk with her
phlox was able to help you youre going to be okay
the seleya
it was destroyed im sorry but i didnt have a choice
they were beyond help their fate was sealed long before we arrived  please dont be long
was commander tucker successful
yes and no he collected a good supply of trellium but it turns out it was trellium that poisoned the vulcan crew and you
its essential you protect this ship leave me on the next habitable planet
im not going to do that
you cant allow your concern for a single crewman to affect your mission this expanse destroyed everyone aboard the seleya dont let it happen to enterprise
well find a way through this but i wont leave anyone behind not if i can help it i cant try to save humanity without holding on to what makes me human
something tells me we havent seen the last of the detective in the bow tie
no he died in a house fire
ah did he the autopsy was inconclusive i wouldnt be surprised if the body belonged to the delivery man with the strange limp you never did see him leave the house
what about the gardener he was there too
too tall even the primitive forensics of the midtwentieth century would have determined that
perhaps we should watch and find out
part of the fun of a mystery is trying to solve it before it ends using logic you of all people should appreciate that
then use logic more quietly
all hands report to stations tactical alert
its all right youre on enterprise youre safe
hoshi
hello
do you understand me i think you do can you see me
ensign sato to security
go ahead  hoshi is everything all right hoshi
i thought i was the only one who lived here during my off hours
id like you to see this these are the locations where weve encountered spatial anomalies i analysed the sensor logs from the xindi database these are the coordinates where that vessel was affected
seems pretty random
thats what i thought until i ran a vector analysis of the gravimetric waves coming from the sphere we discovered the interference patterns implied another wave source
a second sphere
it appears so the simulation suggests that the anomalies occur where the waves intersect
if youre right then we should be able to start predicting where were going to run into trouble
if were going to create an accurate map well need precise measurements of the spheres gravimetric fields
assuming there is a second sphere how far away is it
less than four light years
set a course
nothing
i ran every scan in the book theres no sign of any intruder anywhere on the ship
maybe our sensors missed something
i went through all the logs for the last twenty four hours to say they were uneventful would be an understatement this is good news
that im imagining things
youre a little on edge its not uncommon to see the enemy out of the corner of your eye
i thought that was called paranoia
whatever it is its not uncommon just the other night i thought i heard clicking sounds in my quarters for a moment i could have sworn there was a xindi insectoid lurking in the shadows
what i saw wasnt a shadow
all right ill keep an eye out
theres some mild vasodilation in the prefrontal cortex that would account for your headaches other than that youre in perfect health
are there any more tests that you can run
what do you expect me to find
the last few days ive had the strangest feeling that i am being watched ive heard whispering down corridors in my quarters could i have been exposed to something thats making me hallucinate
theres no evidence of any mindaltering substances on board
so basically this is all in my head
it appears to be
great
i suppose you believe youre dealing badly with stress
its not a good sign when you start to see things that arent there
well thats a matter of opinion on denobula when a person under stress hallucinates its considered healthy a harmless way for the subconscious to release nervous energy ive always envied those who had that facility i tend to keep too much bottled up inside
i should get going tpols asked me to translate a section of the xindi database
hoshi
thats where im waiting for you thats where im waiting for you
ensign sato to lieutenant reed i need help in the command centre
hoshi
who are you
dont be frightened
hoshi
how did you get on board
im nowhere near your ship
what do you want
youre searching for something i can help
hoshi you all right
im not picking up anything out of the ordinary
we still havent found any ships nearby or any uninvited guests on board
i am not imagining it captain
you have to admit its a possibility
with respect sir i know that my mind can be overactive sometimes but that is not whats happening this is real
i want you to keep hoshi under observation until we can sort this out post a security detail outside and assign teams to engineering and the armoury until further notice
are you expecting an attack sir
around here you never know ill see you both in the morning
isnt it about feeding time
ill take care of it after i get you settled
would you mind im really not that tired
be my guest the vulcan rootleafs in that container
thats strange its when the alien communicates with me its almost like hes inside my head looking at things through my eyes experiencing what im experiencing and talking to him is like talking to myself does that make any sense
it makes perfect sense listening to your thoughts has been very pleasurable
what
ive been with you for several days studying your mind your memories learning so many things about you
why me
my telepathy only works in rare instances it takes a unique mind to process it yours is the first ive found in many years
what do you want
im only three light years away my home is what youre seeing right now all i want is to meet you
i dont think thatll be possible
i know youre on an urgent mission thats what i want to talk to you about
what did he tell you about the xindi
hes saving that for my visit
he could have given you something as a show of good faith this could be another attempt by the xindi to infiltrate enterprise
i think he wants to help he was horrified that seven million of us were killed he says hes willing to use his abilities to help us find the xindi i think thats reason enough to meet with him
archer to mayweather
go ahead sir
were taking a slight detour
i asked hoshi to come alone
the captains always a part of first contact missions star fleet regulations i hope thats not a problem
not at all captain
im pleased all three of you could come my name is tarquin im obviously not what you expected i didnt want to frighten you so i created a human image when i contacted you on enterprise thank you for coming to me
you said you could help us with our mission
youre searching for a weapon that could annihilate your planet i may be able to find it but ill need an object thats associated with the xindi
why
every artifact retains an imprint of the people who made it who used it i have the ability to sense those imprints
i can arrange to have something sent down how much time would you need with it
no more than a few days
we didnt pick up any other biosigns i take it you live here alone
alone
its an awfully big planet for one person
ive lived here for a very long time mister reed my only contact with the outside world has been through telepathy bring me the artefact id like to get started
well be back as soon as we can
captain one small request id like hoshi to stay with me while im working
im afraid thats not appropriate
nonetheless its a condition of my helping you
if im comfortable with this i dont get the sense that he would harm me
my instincts tell me otherwise hes hiding something
if hes insistent we could put off looking for the sphere stay in orbit its only for a few days
we dont have the luxury of dealing with one problem at a time anymore sir if he can tell us something about the xindi weapon its worth the risk i can take care of myself captain
this is from the weapon that attacked your planet
we think it was a prototype from a much larger weapon
this will be very useful may i
thanks i need a minute
take your time
do i have to tell you to stay on your toes
i think that falls under the goes without saying category sir
did you bring a phase pistol
ill keep it under my pillow
you know how to reach me
do you always eat like this
only when i have company
thank you
i thought you might enjoy something familiar
programming these dishes was a challenge i had to recreate their tastes and textures from your memory please
it should approximate the recipe from fiorellas on fountain street in san francisco
you have certainly done your homework
ive enjoyed it
whats this
dessert
its a delicacy from the arakon system i think youll like it
you know my stomach is a little unsettled
you told your grandmother that every time she tried to serve you soba noodles now its one of your favourite foods
since you seen to know so much about my past i think its only fair that i know a little about yours where are you from
my homeworld is thirty light years from here a wonderful place to live provided youre not born telepathic the odds are one in fifty million i was among the unlucky few were considered a threat to the rest of the population theres only one solution for people like me to live out our lives in exile so were sent to places like this  to solitude i think youre familiar with it
what do you mean
your parents learned you were gifted so you spent your childhood with private tutors studying languages you thought it was normal to go through your days alone im sorry i forget youre unaware of how much i know about you
are you reading my mind continuously
not since you arrived now that youre here with me i would rather get to know you the way other humans do
this is great but im pretty tired
of course
if you need anything else let me know at supper tomorrow ill be working most of the day feel free to wander there are a lot of interesting things here but i strongly suggest that you stay inside the winds can be treacherous
im sure theres enough to keep me occupied
if youd like you could spend some time looking at this its written in a dead language over a thousand years old everything about these people their homeworld their culture has vanished into time
thank you
you dont have to feel alone
i wont ill be busy with this
thats not what i meant you often feel isolated even around other people you dont have to
archer to the bridge
yes captain
i assume were getting close
you assume correctly
take us out of warp im on my way
yes sir
status
were getting reports of anomalies on all decks
i got you
breaches on decks b c and e emergency bulkheads are in place but three subsections have decompressed
were losing structural integrity in the forward hull
all stop the anomalies are stronger here
if there is another sphere in the region its emitting a lot more gravimetric energy than the first one
which means if we continue theres a good chance the ship is going to get torn apart if it is there how far
approximately seventy five thousand kilometres
it might as well be seventy five thousand light years
bridge to commander tucker
go ahead
how are your engines
holding up
so far so good but i wouldnt recommend putting them through a lot more of this
how long would it take you to insulate a shuttlepod with trelliumd
id need a day to refine enough ore and at least twelve hours
to reconfigure the hull
get started
aye sir
hold our position  you might want to steer clear of the launch bay for the next couple of days
indeed
im sorry i didnt mean to disturb you
not at all please
have you had a chance to look at the book i gave you
im about halfway through
i didnt expect you to translate it so quickly
arent you supposed to know me better than that
what did you think of it
its an interesting language reminds me of medieval klingon any progress
a few images impressions did you know that there are five xindi species
thats what weve heard
theres a great deal of conflict among them they dont trust one another
do you know where theyre building the weapon
not yet im going to need more time
whats this
it helps me extend the range of my telepathy my family gave it to me when i was exiled without it i never would have found you would you like to try
is that possible
with guidance
if you close your eyes you begin to sense light and colour let the images take shape let the shapes become more distinct can you see them
i think so
youre trying too hard to find them let the images come to you
how do you make sense of all that
it takes practice try again
maybe later i should let you get back to your work
feel free to return if youd like some company
thanks
i asked you to stay inside
is this why you didnt want me out here who are they
theyre people i knew the last one died over a century ago we should go inside
how did they die
very few lifespans are as long as mine
how old are you
i was born over four hundred years ago
who were they
the first one was morianna taal she was my first companion like you she had a unique mind
and the other three
companions as well when i lost morianna i began to search for another then another sometimes i dont know what is worse being alone or having to bury the people ive come to care about its been many years since i found someone like you
youre right we should go back inside
all im asking is that you consider the possibility
you know that enterprise is on an important mission i just cant abandon my duties
its possible that with my help your mission will be over soon
do you really expect me to spend the rest of my life on a desolate world with someone i have known for less than two days
the others had similar doubts but over time they came to appreciate what i had to offer them no one will ever understand you the way i can
i am grateful for your help and im happy to stay here while you work but i have no intention of becoming your next companion
if you think projecting yourself as human is going to make me change my mind youre mistaken
youve let your fear of the unknown stand in your way far too many times you almost left enterprise early in its mission because you didnt think you could control your fears but in spite of that you stayed it strengthened you this situation is no different
you obviously misinterpreted a few memories because this situation is very different
im giving you the chance to experience something youve searched for your entire life its the reason you study languages to make unique connections with people
i dont need you to help me do that
then why do you seem so isolated you live on a ship filled with your own people and yet there are many times when you feel alone stay with me ill teach you ways of sharing thoughts and emotions no human can
i already told you im not interested
youre lying hoshi i can hear everything youre thinking
what im thinking is none of your business
michio your grandfather hes the last person you were truly close to but he died a long time ago
leave me alone
you can have that kind of connection again
leave me alone
im sorry i know this must seem overwhelming think about what ive said youre going to have a great deal of time
sensors say were passing through a gravimetric distortion
no anomalies
trellium seems to be doing its job
archer to enterprise
go ahead
were approaching seventy nine thousand kilometres still no sign
of the cloaking barrier
adjust your heading to oh one six mark two
stand by
that felt promising
i believe you just grazed the perimeter turn starboard three point six degrees
i think weve found it
maintain course you should be heading directly towards the cloaking barrier
powers fluctuating
hull integrity
some microfractures but nothing we cant handle  switching to backup
trip
lets get going with the scans
ah hell
is there a problem
the sensor relays were damaged
how much time do you need
not long but well have to get back to enterprise i need to open up the circuit housings on the undercarriage no way to get to them from the inside
bring the descent thrusters online
youre not planning to land on that thing
thrusters trip and get the ev suits ready
not exactly my idea of shore leave
get to work im going to take a look around
dont get lost
hows it coming trip
almost there sir just two more relays
captain
what happened
the port thruster ignited
i can see that
when i was bypassing the last relay i must have triggered a surge in the propulsion system son of a bitch
its going to be a long time before enterprise decides to come looking for us
can we launch without a port thruster
we can sure as hell try
whoever gets the first clear shot
careful sir that was awfully close to the o2 recycler
i need to spend more time in the armoury
archer to enterprise
were here captain
it was right where you said it was tpol we got all the scans you asked for
may i come in i wont be long i just heard from your captain enterprise will be here in a few minutes i have learned a great deal about the xindi weapon im sure hell find the information useful
thank you for all your help
have you given any more thought to my offer
i cant stay here you know that
i understand i was foolish to think it was even a possibility
the next time you invite someone for a visit you might want to let them know youre looking for a lifelong companion
i wont forget please keep the book as a reminder of your time here
i was hoping youd say that im nearly done and im anxious to see how it ends
after ive briefed captain archer ill send him to you it was a privilege knowing you
how was your stay
itll be good to get back to enterprise
im sure if its any consolation your time here was well spent weve learnt more about the xindi than i expected and hes offered to keep supplying us with information for as long as were in range thanks to you
glad i could help sir
there is one condition he wants you to stay with him while he continues his work
i assume you told him that wouldnt be possible
i wont order you to do this hoshi but it may be our best chance of finding the weapon before its too late with any luck itll only take a few weeks maybe a month wed come back for you as soon as the missions over i dont need to tell you whats at stake ensign
ill go back to my quarters and pick up a few things
thank you hoshi theres no reason for you to leave just give me a list of what you need and ill have it sent down
i should brief my replacement on the ut upgrades
well take care of it dont worry
at least give me a chance to say goodbye to the crew
i wish there was time
it wont take long sir i might not see my friends again
im sure travis will understand
travis
travis and the others they realise how important this is
i was just thinking about travis youre a regular mind reader
weve known each other a long time
where is captain archer
well be back for you as soon as we can
where is he
hoshi
where is captain archer
hoshi
open a channel to ensign sato
our signals not getting through sir theres some kind of disruption field
sir
whats going on
my stations down
everythings going offline main and auxiliary power warp engines life support
nice try what were you planning to tell my captain when he got back were you going to appear as me and beg him to let me stay no you cant do that can you im the only one on board that you can play your tricks with
enterprise has already returned their fate in in your hands
what is that supposed to mean
i cant let you leave hoshi ive waited too long to find you
whats happened to enterprise
if you agree to stay they wont be harmed theyll be free to leave orbit
let me speak to captain archer
thats not possible
why the hell not
youll be happy here i promise you
why cant i speak to captain archer
theres no power on your vessel and there wont be until you agree to remain with me
you would kill over eighty people to keep me here
i dont want to kill anyone thats why its essential that you agree to stay  you mustnt do that its very fragile
im counting on that now undo whatever youve done to my ship or you will never contact anyone again with this thing
an empty threat hoshi as long as youre with me i wont need to contact anyone else
as long as im with you another sixty seventy years and then what  whatll you do when im grave number five out there without this you will never find another companion you will be alone for the rest of your life
please think of what i can offer you
this is your last chance
report
powers returning to all systems
malcolm
weapons are coming back online
tactical alert
aye sir
its ensign sato
put her through
captain are you all right
we are now what the hells going on
i think its time to come get me
what have you got
the data you collected allowed me to create a nearly accurate map of the anomalies
nearly
these are the coordinates where weve encountered strong anomalies
the waves arent intersecting where theyre supposed to
exactly the locations are being influenced by more than two gravimetric sources
a third sphere
a third sphere would correct some of the error but not all of it so i had the computer run a covariant extrapolation
how many
well need to get farther into the expanse to be certain but at least fifty
fifty manmade spheres each one the size of a small moon
and each one generating massive amounts of gravimetric energy
did it ever occur to you that whoever built these things may have done it to create the expanse
why would someone want to create a web of crippling anomalies
what are you doing here
did you enjoy the ending
you cant do this i dont want you watching me
this is the last time i promise ive brought you information to give to your captain
why now
youre on a dangerous mission i dont want to see you harmed who knows you may change your mind about me someday
come in
i thought i told you to get some rest
he came to my quarters
i was afraid that might happen
he gave me these coordinates
what are they for
a xindi colony he said theyre building part of the weapon there
were preparing to test the weapon on an uninhabited planet in the calindra system        but were going to need another shipment of kemocite at least one hundred kilograms
ill contact gralik if the test is successful how long before we can deploy        the weapon
a matter of weeks
there are no defensive systems
no active sensor sweeps or artificial satellites no vessels anywhere in the        vicinity
weve seen how different xindi technology is they could have defences we cant detect
its also possible that what weve been told about this colony isnt accurate        were putting a lot of faith in hoshis telepathic friend
what about these energy readings        they could be coming from a weapons complex
they could also be electrical storms deposits of diamagnetic ore or
or a glitch in our sensors i know but if theres any chance that something on        that planet could lead us to the xindi weapon we have to investigate it after we        enter the system well stay on the far side of that moon it should keep us out of view        tell major hayes hell be joining us on a reconnaissance mission we launch in two hours
archer to enterprise
go ahead
ive found a landing site twelve kilometres north of the energy readings any        sign theyve detected us
scans are still negative your signals breaking up
ive set a steep approach vector and weve ionised the hull itll help        disburse any scanning beams
acknowledged
if anyone sees us theyll think were a meteor
how much further
eight hundred metres just over that rise
thats definitely the source of the        energy readings
theyre xindi
reptilian
no one of the other species we saw on the database
weve picked up readings across the spectrum positron emissions antiproton        bursts whatever theyre doing in there its using a lot of power
corporal hawkins is standing by with an assault team
tell him to keep standing by im not ready to send in the troops        just yet weve checked out the perimeter of the complex i think we can get inside        without being detected
well maintain communications silence inside the complex ill contact        you at oh four hundred archer out
im not picking up any security devices
what about people
approximately eighty inside the complex but not within a hundred metres
captain some kind of radiolytic compound it doesnt match anything in        our database theres several hundred kilograms n this room
there were impurities in the last three production cycles
we found a ruptured seal in the tertiary processing chamber its been repaired
well have to increase the production rate by at least sixty percent assign two additional teams
degra isnt being realistic this facility wasnt designed to manufacture such large quantities
your job is to synthesis kemocite i suggest you get back to it have these canisters retested        salvage what you can then destroy the rest
we have it captain
i need an analysis as soon as possible
acknowledged
captain this place obviously has something to do with the weapon it seems to me the        sooner we put it out of commission the better
two spatial charges thats all it would take to destroy the complex from orbit
that might set them back for a while but we cant lose sight of our main objective        i want to know where theyre shipping this kemocite it could lead us to the weapon
i have some questions for you
who are you what do you want from me
sit down
theres nobody else here sir apparently he lives alone
take watch outside
whats your name
gralik durr
my names jonathan archer im from earth
is that supposed to explain why you forced your way into my home
tell me about kemocite
its a multiphasic isotope
used for what
there are numerous applications it depends on the level of refinement
youre working with someone named degra who is he
thats none of your concern
whats he using it for
kemocite can be used for any number of purposes i dont make a habit        of asking our clients what they plan to do with it
maybe you should because this batch is being used to create a weapon to exterminate my people
what
i want to know where the weapon is being build and when its going to be ready
i dont know what youre talking about
im not leaving here until i get the answers i need
i managed to identify a subquantum imprint it matches the signature of        the xindi probe
theres no doubt about it captain this isotope was used in the weapon        that attacked earth
have you learnt anything from the interrogation
not yet but this should help
something else captain
i ran a scan on that rifle we picked up there it was again the same        quantum imprint id like permission to take it apart
go ahead well contact you in a couple of hours
understood
congratulations sir three months ago we entered the expanse with no        idea who these xindi were or how to find them and now were about to destroy        one of their weapons facilities
i thought we were here to try and stop a war not start one
they struck first
because they were told were going to attack them they think theyre        acting in selfdefence by destroying this complex well be confirming their        worst fears about humanity
lets not forget the seven million people who were killed
have major hayes lay down blast suppressors when this facility goes        i dont want to take the rest of the settlement with it
what about gralik sir hell tell them about enterprise
ill deal with gralik when the time comes i dont intend to let        anyone know we were here
i cant imagine what the captain wants this for
he was quite insistent
we ran the quantum analysis three times doesnt he trust us
he said he needed it to help prove a point
how long are you going to keep me here
thats up to captain archer
well you can tell him that ill be in my study
im afraid youre going to have to stay right here
i have work to do
and im under orders please sit down
ive already told you everything i know
ah captain archer i        was beginning to think youd forgotten about me
you said you werent involved in building weapons
thats correct
explain this
i dont know what this is
its a fragment of a probe that murdered seven million people        the dead pilot was xindi the alloy is xindi and its imprinted with the        quantum signature of the compound you produce here we know youre constructing        a larger version of the weapon big enough to destroy a planet i want to know        where its being built
you burst into my home show me some twisted piece of metal and tell me        it proves im a mass murderer ive never seen your species before ive never        heard of a planet called earth and whether you believe me or not i had        nothing to do with killing millions of its inhabitants
im flattered you requested my assistance commander but weaponry isnt        exactly my area of expertise
my scans of this thing showed organic components and i figured anything        biological is more your turf than mine
what do you think
they appear to be generating synaptic impulses
is it alive
wouldnt make a very good pet but definitely organic
and it appears to have reproductive        capabilities
the kemocite is extremely refined
did it come from this facility
it did we supply many species with kemocite not just xindi        it has countless applications when degra requested shipments so        highly refined we celebrated realising the wealth it would bring        to our colony we never considered why he wanted such pure kemocite        perhaps our greed blinded us from the possibility that it would be used in constructing a weapon
is degra a reptilian
no hes a xindi primate
i met one at a mining complex
theyre similar to you apelike degra and his people have        always been fair truthful that may have been why i believed him when        he said the shipment was for research perhaps hes become as untrustworthy        as the reptilians
weve run into a few of them too its hard to imagine five sentient        species evolving on the same planet
five i suppose there are now
no thanks
do you mind
no go ahead
there was a sixth species the avians theyve been gone since the war
gone
extinct as far as im told none of them fled before our homeworld was destroyed
we found some debris how did it happen
the war went on for nearly a hundred years the sides changed alliances were        forged and then broken by the time it ended i doubt any of the six species remembered        what started it but everyone remembered what ended it as well as being unstable politically        our planet was even more unstable geologically in a final desperate act the insectoids and        reptilians detonated massive explosions beneath the eight largest seismic fissures id like        to think they didnt realise how devastating the result would be my grandfather lived there        he told me of places where the sky was sometimes filled with avians now theyre gone
the other five species did survive from what i can tell they dont all live on        remote colonies like this one
the descendants of those that escaped are scattered across the expanse many live        peaceful lives but obviously not all
captain
ill be right back
sir
its okay
the suppressors are in place the blast wave should be mostly confined        to the facility sir i noticed a lot of activity down there it seemed like something is going on
archer
captain weve detected a ship approaching the planet the hull        configuration matches the xindi vessel that attacked us
reptilians
recognise anyone
the reptilians seem rather upset about something
you got something
ive been running scans of the weapons organic component its        neural pathways appear to help modulate the rifles power output        its the most sophisticated example of biomechanical engineering ive ever seen
you said you had good news doc
ah yes ive been attempting to break down this creatures immune        system
youre trying to make it sick
however its proving to be quite resilient i tried an array of        viruses and pathogens but its immune to all of them then i began        exposing it to various radioactive spectra a sustained burst of        delta radiation
if we rig up portable em emitters we can knock out reptilian        weapons before any of them get the chance to pull the trigger
in theory unfortunately the amount of radiation required would        be extremely hazardous to any humans in the area
its still a place to start great work doc keep at it
and commander id avoid exposing any of the xindi technology       to omicron radiation it seems to thrive on it as you can see
ill keep that in mind
theyre ahead of schedule we werent expecting them for another        three days you might not have much time left to accomplish your mission
what makes you say that
weve been processing kemocite for them for nearly six months        theyre here for their final shipment captain im the primary        technician in this facility theyll want to talk to me before        accepting delivery to confirm that all of their technical requirements have been met        i may be able to obtain some information for you about this weapon
that could be dangerous
im willing to take that risk
how do i know you wont expose us tell them about enterprise
im proud of my craft captain ive practiced it for many years        i wont let my work be corrupted in this way seven million people if id chosen my clients more carefully        that tragedy might not have happened i dont intend to let it happen again
archer
captain there are two xindi biosigns heading this way
gralik are you there gralik
degras probably wondering where i am his companions dont like to be kept waiting
captain theyve gone
theyll return probably with armed reptilians
just because you didnt show up for work
there are fewer than a hundred people on this planet it        doesnt go unnoticed when one of them is missing degra wont leave        until he sees the results of the final isotopic analysis you should reconsider my offer
thats good right there
are you sure this is wise
thats four inches of solid duranium if this thing can blast a hole        through it then were in even worse trouble than we thought
still it might be prudent to find a more suitable environment to test it
we dont have time to go looking for some deserted asteroid if thats what you mean
if i may commander tucker and i have learnt all we can from examining the        workings of the device a practical test is the next logical step
ive rigged up four of malcolms force field emitters theyll contain any blast debris
what about radiation or particle disbursement you know nothing about this device
thats the point those xindi took out half of our security force        when they came aboard now if we dont start making some progress        understanding their weapons we wont stand a chance in hell of beating them when the time comes
let me know when youre ready
give us an hour
more delays
we did surprise them by arriving early
thats no excuse they should have been ready by now such lethargic creatures
you could learn something from them patience for example wheres gralik
we cant find him
in a complex this size how difficult can it be
weve searched everywhere no ones seen him
he often takes walks outside the settlement
walks
without his analysis i cant proceed
weve organised search teams
we dont have time for you to go foraging through the forest well find him ourselves
what is it
someones closing on our position sir four hundred metres
reptilians
im not certain three hundred and fifty metres
stay with him
still closing sir two hundred metres one fifty theyre bloody fast whoever they are
take cover
its a seeker the reptilians built them for reconnaissance        they were used to great effect during the war it seems as though you may have been exposed after all
lets hope they didnt get a very good look at us
there are some caves not far ahead they should provide us with some        cover in case we encounter any more of those
ready doc
ready
whats wrong
it wont fire i dont understand
perhaps it has a safety device
whats that
its coming from the weapon
looks like some kind of countdown
the energy levels are increasing its overloading
i cant shut it down damn things boobytrapped
if you remove the power cell
itll just grow back
quick thinking commander
you were right we probably should have found a nice empty asteroid to test it on
the xindi ship is still in orbit we havent detected any other vessels
understood
captain if the xindi have detected your presence
i strongly urge you to return to the ship
i appreciate your concern
but we still have a few loose ends to tie up down here archer out anything
no sir we just might have stopped those bloodhounds before they transmitted our        position
lets hope so
no sign of the reptilians
i doubt theyll find us thats topaline ore it should disrupt their scanners        even their seekers wont locate us here what do you intend to do now captain destroy our facility        do you plan to wait until im back inside or will you simply dispose of me here in the forest
ive been considering another option
id certainly like to hear it
the people in this colony had nothing to do with the attack on my planet ill be         damned if im going to make them pay for it you offered to help us are you still willing
if youre prepared to trust me
then well give them their kemocite but it wont be exactly what they ordered
make sure he gets home safely
yes sir
it would be better if i went alone
good luck
and you
permission to speak freely
go ahead
im not sure it was wise to let him go
he could lead the reptilians back here
are you speaking freely as well major
just offering a tactical assessment sir
noted he said hed help us i believe him
its the captain go ahead sir
tell the armoury to hold off on those spatial charges theres been a change of plans
is everything all right
ill let you know in a couple of hours right now i have an assignment for you and hoshi
theyre looking for you
have you started loading the shipment
not yet
good i want to run another refinement test
weve completed three already the impurities were less than six parts per million
we have to be absolutely certain that weve met their specifications        you know how important this is to all of us
we should get started
you two perform the isotopic analysis ill run the submolecular scans
weve got it
weve modified
the radiolytic signature if you can get it onboard their ship ill be able to track it
understood
where were you
my personal activities arent your concern
and do your personal activities involve destroying one of our seekers
i was hunting tree scarabs your drone was frightening them
who was with you
i prefer to spend my time in the forest alone
our scans detected other biosigns
i was alone
if you saw the drone you knew we were here why didnt you return
youre two days early
what are you doing
running some final tests
what kind of tests we were told the shipment was ready
forty two years thats how long ive been running this facility and never        once have i allowed a single gram of kemocite to leave the premises unless        it was perfectly calibrated i take pride in my work but if youre so eager to get underway        then go ahead take your shipment but if it doesnt meet your requirements dont        expect me to produce another hundred kilograms overnight because we do have other clients besides you
finish quickly
there are two of them loading containers
stand by captain
acknowledged
theyre heading back
youre clear sir
reed to enterprise
go ahead
the captains inside the xindi shuttle
acknowledged
captain three xindi have just come out of the complex
understood
lieutenant reed report
weve run into a small problem stand by
we appreciate your efforts
perhaps youll need our services in the future
perhaps
ill miss the pleasure of your company
we should go degra were behind schedule already
weve invested a great deal in this project
and youve been well paid for it
yes youve been more than generous but id appreciate it if you could tell me what this shipment        is being used for i dont think its an unreasonable request
it doesnt concern you
it concerns all of us weve learned theres a threat to our people
what kind of threat
a ruthless alien species if we dont act theyll destroy us
im glad we could contribute
take pride in what youve done here
archer to enterprise
go ahead
whats the status of that xindi ship
it broke orbit five minutes ago captain
are you picking up the tracking signal
loud and clear
keep an eye on it well be as soon as we can
acknowledged
thank you is something wrong
i may have just betrayed my people to a ruthless alien species
i promise you you havent please trust me
to trust
eventually degras going to discover that you sabotaged his kemocite
it should delay their progress considerably
hell come back here
dont worry i can deal with degra and his friends you should        just be concerned with finding this weapon
their ship entered an energy portal after it left orbit weve lost our tracking signal
the portals range is only a few light years keep searching
id better get back to enterprise
if everything youve told me is true about the attack on your world i hope you remember        that all xindi are not your enemy
i will
archer to the bridge
im sorry sir ive orders to keep you here
orders from whom
the captain
were losing forward hull plating
target their engines
no effect
what the hells going on
someone take him back to his quarters
weapons are offline
captain
hello
youre up early
tpol
i know this all seems unfamiliar i promise ill explain everything why dont you sit down breakfast is almost ready
where are we
jonathan please sit down ill answer all of your questions today is a very important day i have a great deal to tell you whats the last thing you remember
i was in the command centre looking at long range scans
do you remember what happened after you left the command centre
we were in a corridor you and i on our way to the bridge
this will be difficult for you to accept but that was twelve years ago
you coming tonight
i hadnt planned on it
i can make movie night mandatory for senior officers youll enjoy it rosemarys baby itll scare the hell out of you
archer to the bridge report
theres a power surge in the starboard nacelle it seems to have been caused by an anomaly
take us out of warp
the helms not responding the starboard injectors are fused
im reading more anomalies ahead
after course twenty degrees to port
you have to get out of here
im not leaving you
how do you feel
like a shuttle pod landed on my head was anyone else hurt
no captain there are a few questions i have to ask you
well itll have to wait i want to get to the bridge
im afraid i have to insist when did you last speak to commander tucker
this morning staff briefing why whats going on phlox
the anomaly in the corridor left something behind weve never seen it before this is a microcellular scan of your hippocampus youve been infected by several clusters of parasites they havent caused any tissue damage but theyre impairing certain synaptic functions theyre preventing you from forming new long term memories
long term
you can recall events that happened before the infection but everything after fades within a few hours captain youve been in sickbay for the past three days you last spoke to commander tucker about seven hours ago he came to see you right here
you cant remove these parasites
so far they havent responded to any traditional therapies but im synthesising an antigen that shows some promise you can be assured i wont stop working on this until i find a cure
the doctor continued to search for a remedy over the next several weeks commander tucker and i did our best to keep you updated each day on the progress of our mission
it looked like we had a lead on that xindi ship the one we planted that tracking devise on but it turned out to be a garbage scow
they were carrying a shipment with the same radiolytic signature
i had an idea this morning after you told me what happened i came up with a way to upgrade the antimatter inducers we can travel farther on less fuel let me guess i already gave you these specs
a week ago but your upgrades are working nicely well i should get back to engineering see you both later
i imagine that must happen often maybe these daily briefings arent such a good idea looks like its just a waste of your time and trips
i disagree we both rely on your experience you can still contribute to the success of this mission
im sure you have work to do ill be in my quarters
in the corridor when the anomaly hit i urged you to leave me behind if you had its likely id be the one suffering from this condition
fortunately i dont take orders from you
captain i never expressed my gratitude for what you did
i suppose theres not much point in thanking me a few hours from now i wont remember
bridge to tpol
go ahead
were receiving a haul through the subspace buoy its starfleet
im on my way
this was not a conversation i was looking forward to
it was admiral forrest the command council had reviewed the doctors report on your condition they relieved you of duty and granted me a field commission
forrest made you captain i suppose congratulations are in order even if they are belated i guess these parasites werent so easy to remove after all
phlox discovered that the organisms are from a domain outside normal spacetime they exist in a state of interspatial flux none of his treatments had any effect on them
what about the mission did you find the xindi weapon
after several months of searching we learned where the weapon was being constructed but the xindi knew we were getting close they dispatched two vessels to intercept us
that last one took out warp engines
theyre locking on to the starboard docking port
send security teams
im reading twenty three intruders on decks c d and e
have your men set up a defence perimeter on b deck
weve lost weapons
is their ship still docked with us
it is
both ships are disabled
weve lost thirteen of the crew twenty two injured several critical
the xindi
weve taken nine prisoners but the brig was only designed for two im not sure what to do with the others
blow them out the airlock
put them in crew quarters under heavy guard how are the repairs coming
we should have hull plating and torpedoes in the next couple of hours the warp drives another question the starboard nacelles a lost cause half the coils have been fused
how long to repair them
if we were at jupiter station three weeks out here id have to rebuild the coil assembly from scratch six months minimum for now the best i can give you is a warp one point seven
were not going to get very far at that speed
resume our previous heading dismissed
how can we keep going with one warp engine
theres no option
what the world where you thinking when you rammed that ship
i chose the logical course of action
since the captain got sick this missions taken one wrong turn after another
if you believe ive acted improperly i suggest you contact admiral forrest
you said we eventually found the weapon how could we manage that without warp engines
we located the facility where the xindi constructed the probe but it had already been deployed
earth
destroyed they didnt stop at your homeworld they attacked every human outpost they could find mars alpha centauri vega colony all were destroyed
how many of us are left
less than six thousand
were on the fifth planet in the ceti alpha system its far from the expanse
what happened to the crew
most of them are still aboard the ship its in orbit patrolling this system
how did all these people get here
survivors from human colonies realised they needed a place to take refuge several convoys headed for this system one of them was lead by enterprise
theres a ship approaching at high warp its vulcan
theyre hailing us
ambassador
i need to speak with you tpol
come in
that uniform doesnt suit you captain
i doubt you travelled all this way to criticise my attire
i want you to return with me to vulcan
im no longer under your authority
its not an order its a request for your own safety two weeks ago the high command received a distress call from the earth convoy in the mutara system by the time our ships reached them they found nothing but a field of debris the weapon signatures were xindi even if your ships do manage to reach ceti alpha its most likely youll find an armada waiting for you
were prepared to confront them
it was a mistake ordering you to leave enterprise it forced you to make an impulsive decision if you return with me now the high command is prepared to reinstate your rank
i wont leave them
them or him there are specialists on vulcan that can help archer
youd take him as well
if you return to vulcan you owe the humans nothing they chose to leave earth before they were ready if theyd accepted our counsel this tragedy would have been avoided
we could have saved them
how
we held back their warp programme for one hundred years a policy which you supported if we would have helped them develop faster ships better defences
your emotional attachment to archer is clouding your logic well be within range for another thirty hours should you reconsider
come in did things go well with the vulcans
how did you know that they were
there was obviously a reason i chose these quarters you can see a lot from this window what did they want
they were here to replenish our supplies
ha ive been thinking about everything you told me i realise im not fit to command the ship but theres got to be some way i can help i could give trip a hand in engineering
we tried something similar to that a few months ago it was uncomfortable for you
so im supposed to stay locked up in my quarters all day
you often take porthos for a walk visit the classrooms on d deck the children enjoy hearing about our earlier missions
in other words just stay out of the way
after nearly a year we arrived in this system our convey was the only one to reach it the others had all been attacked and destroyed
this planets barely minsharaclass maybe we shouldve picked one with a little more blue and green on it id like to head down with a survey team and start scouting for colony sites
youre needed on enterprise the civilian leaders are going to want to meet with you
me youre the one they deal with
im resigning my commission
youre sure you want to do this
captain archer will be better off on the surface with the others hell need a caretaker someone he trusts i cant be in two places at the same time
youre making one hell of a sacrifice why
i have my reasons
the civilian ships were disassembled for their components and raw materials we used them to construct the settlement at this point you often wonder if youre a victim of some elaborate deception
the thought did cross my mind
margaret mullin you met her when you were twenty four years old during flight school in san francisco the night before you graduated you asked her to marry you outside of her apartment on westgate avenue she turned you down she said she didnt want to become a starfleet widow
how the hell did you know that
our relationship has evolved over the years
exactly how far has it evolved
nothing seems to have changed since your last exam
is this why you came all the way from denobula to give me a checkup
you didnt tell him after this settlement was established it became clear that i was never going to find a treatment for your condition if i remained here so i returned home and consulted with some of the finest neurosurgeons and quantum theorists on denobula my colleagues believed there was no way to destroy these parasites short of vaporising you in a subspace implosion they assured me the technology to do what was required did not exist and they were correct it took almost a decade to develop but now im ready to put it to the test the procedure requires tremendous amounts of energy levels that can only be produced in the reactor of a warp powered starship
were going to enterprise
its good to see you sir
captain tucker i dont think you need to call me sir anymore
old habits i apologise for the low lighting were running on reserve power antimatters at a premium these days
how long has it been since you took command
nine years ive got some people whod like to say hello
youre looking well sir
thank you commander is it
actually ive been promoted to captain
malcolms taking over the intrepid from ramirez
did everyone get their own ship while i was gone
not everyone sir
hoshi
theres a reception in the mess hall if youre feeling up to it
a visit to engineering may be in order first
ill be using a highly focused antiproton beam to eradicate the parasites well start with this cluster today
why not remove all of them at once
this procedures never been attempted before we should move cautiously
when can you begin
the emitters should be calibrated within the hour
come in
you left the reception early
it was a little disturbing from my perspective i saw most of those people just a few hours ago it couldnt have been easy for you telling me the same story over and over again for twelve years
i dont always tell it in detail
i hope ive told you before but im very grateful for everything youve done for me if this works
phlox to captain archer
go ahead
were ready
im picking up an intermittent duranium signature
is it a ship
im not certain its in a close orbit around the sun
weve better check it out lay in a course
increase to eight hundred millicochranes
increase to eight fifty
theres a small vessel just outside the chromosphere
is it xindi
the hull configuration doesnt match theres one biosign on board
open up a channel this is captain charles tucker is there something we can help you with
hes moving
follow him
his warp coils are charging
target one of his nacelles
bring it into the launch bay
just as my simulations predicted theres no trace of the parasites i targeted well i understand i may have a passenger on my voyage home
im remaining at the settlement for the time being he may need my help during his recovery
have you told the captain how you feel about him its obvious youve become quite attached its nothing to be ashamed of vulcans experience the same emotions as any other species theyre simply better at hiding them
im not hiding anything he risked his life to save me im merely repaying a debt
i can only imagine what it must have been like spending all those years in that house learning so much about him yet he remembers nothing about you beyond the day he became ill if were successful perhaps things will be different
theres a discrepancy in these scans
what is it
i deal in rigelian flamegems i was waiting for a prospective buyer when you attacked me
you picked an odd place for a business transaction
we searched your ship we didnt find any cargo
thats because i jettisoned it all i thought you where going to arrest me flamegems are illegal in this region
we found your species in our vulcan database it appears yridians are information dealers
who hired you was it the xindi
xindi
maybe we didnt give his vessel a close enough look go back to the launch bay use a plasma torch and slice that ship into neat little pieces keep at it until you find some evidence that supports his story
youre going to destroy my ship its not you they want its the denobulan
phlox
i was hired to follow him
hired by who
i dont know they work through intermediaries i was paid to follow the denobulan if he ever left his home world
what did you tell them answer me
whats the problem
your engineers wont let us continue with the captains treatment
those are my orders look id do anything to help the captain but weve got bigger problems at the moment
this maybe the only solution to your problems captain
destroying these parasites is most likely the key to saving humanity and earth
earths gone
this image was taken a few minutes ago you can see the region where i eradicated the first cluster of parasites its gone in this image as well
doc
this scan was taken over twelve years ago the cluster has disappeared from all the scans ive taken over the last twelve years its as if it never existed at all
by destroying the organisms in the present we appear to have neutralised them in the past
we know theyre from another spatial domain apparently they also exist outside of time if we can eliminate all of the parasites its possible the captains infection will never have occurred
history may be altered captain archer will have remained in command of enterprise our mission in the expanse could have an entirely different outcome
we only have to divert power for a few hours i am certain i can complete the procedure in that time
im sorry we need all the power weve got for the weapons
if the xindi are on their way theres very little we can do to stop them
well we cant just run up the white flag
bridge to captain tucker youd better get up here sir
im on my way well talk about this later
im getting a signal from one of our sentry probes six xindi ships have entered the system
charge the phase cannons is everyone in position
aye sir
the xindi ships are in range
fire
our shields are holding nice to know they work in combat
remind me to send a note to general shran adjust your heading three one oh mark two seven full impulse
two of their ships are breaking off theyre following us
what about the others
still heading towards the planet
the insectoid ships been damaged theyre losing power
target the second one
their engines disabled
the other xindi ships have changed their heading
i think were going to find out how much of a beating these new shields can take
tpol whats happening
jonathan you need to rest where are you going
to the bridge im not going to just lie here while they destroy whats left of humanity
you should remain here
forward shieldings at fifty two percent
turbolifts are down
intrepids taken a direct hit theyve lost their port nacelle
tell them to withdraw
our phase cannons are down our forward shields collapsing
hull breaches on b deck c deck
theyre targeting the bridge
hard to port
the bridge is gone
tpol to phlox
go ahead
meet us in engineering were going to finish the procedure
understood
we dont have time to worry about parasites right now
thats not necessarily true come with me ill explain
im sorry captain the chambers been damaged
didnt you say that we could destroy the parasites with a subspace implosion
yes but then we
can we create one
we would have to overload three plasma injectors that would send a feedback pulse through the reactor
youll destroy the ship
at this point it wont make much of a difference you two get to a shuttlepod theyre only after humans if this doesnt work out youll still have a chance thats an order
with all due respect you were relieved of command
one of the plasma injectors was damaged well have to replace it theyre in supply locker c on the upper level
were back in business
phlox phlox
how much longer
stand by
how do you feel
like a shuttlepod landed on my head whats our status
weve cleared the anomalies there is minor damage to the starboard nacelle repairs should be complete within an hour
you suffered a mild concussion id like to keep you overnight for observation
all right doctor
you could have been seriously injured i told you to leave me behind
fortunately i dont take orders from you
i believe you wanted to see this
rosemarys baby
you were obviously looking forward to it and since youre not going to be able to attend tonight
thanks would you mind bringing me another pillow
would you turn down the lights just a little
anything else
you know youd make a wonderful nurse
any last words
go to hell
i didnt know skags believed in hell
whos paying for the box
i hope youre not planning to bury him in the cemetery
his people dont bury their dead but i wouldnt expect you to know that
im sorry i didnt get there in time to stop them
what difference would it have made
hed have gotten a trial
and the same people who lynched him would have been sitting on the jury
bethany he killed a man selfdefence or not thats a hanging offence for a skag
what have you got
ive confirmed that theyre human their dna is a perfect match
looks pretty authentic captain right down to the spittoons
and the hangings if these people are from earth how the hell did they get here
archer to enterprise report
weve scanned ninety percent of the surface
the human settlements are clustered within a few hundred kilometres of your location about six thousand people
and the aliens
fewer than a thousand
their closest encampment is ten kilometres north west of your present position
any signs of technology energy signatures
vessels
none sir our quantum scans put the earliest structures at over two hundred and fifty years old
that sounds about right
but theyre all constructed of materials indigenous to the planet
acknowledged i want you to go check out that alien settlement see what you can find theres no telling how anyone would react if they find out who we really are keep a low profile
aye sir
morning
can i help you folks
i hope so we need a horse
what happened to yours
excuse me
its a long way from the next town howd you get here
our horses perished several miles north of your town from heat exhaustion
well youre lucky the sun vipers didnt get you or those skags
come on this one here four years old good stock twenty dollars shes yours
sounds kind of steep dont suppose youd be interested in a trade
well that depends what youve got to trade
look i know its not worth the horse but we only need him for a couple of hours we just want to ride out and grab our gear well be back before you know it well how about i leave my gun for collateral
you got yourself a deal buddy
do you have any experience riding these animals
ive seen every john ford western
who
how hard can it be
better hold on
afternoon
what can i get you
im passing through town i was hoping i could sit in here for a while till it cools down
coffees on the house
thanks
wherere you headed
my brothers got a ranch down south he said he could set me up with some work
whats he raising bluehorns
howd you know
land down theres not good for much else
see the resemblance
yeah yeah i do youre not telling me youre related to cooper smith
hes my ancestor
ill be damned
yep youre looking at the only direct descendant of the man who overthrew the skags
ill bet youve got some stories
got a few i could tell you
friends of yours
not particularly
how about a little service
whatll it be
anything but that rotgut you were pouring yesterday
why dont you join us
you know im not allowed to do that mister bennings
its deputy bennings and i can bend a local ordnance if i choose have a seat  i imagine you could use a drink after what happened last night lets raise a glass to the dearly departed to dead skags
drink up
i thought you people could hold your liquor your friend had a few in him the night he killed clay stanton
he didnt drink
beg your pardon
id better get back to work
oh no wait a minute i dont think i heard you right youre telling me that a sober skag had the nerve to shoot a man i find that hard to believe maybe you could demonstrate
pick it up shoot me right here between the eyes this is your golden opportunity dont pass it up
i know youd like to kill me thats what all you skags want isnt it go ahead or maybe you need to finish that drink first
excuse me can i get some more coffee before you shoot him
who the hell are you
names archer
well mister archer you could learn a thing or two about manners
i dont like being interrupted in the middle of a conversation
ill keep that in mind
is there a problem here
i was just having a drink with our friend draysik and this gentleman decided to butt in
i saw you this morning at the undertakers whats your business here
just passing through town
this skag a friend of yours
i just wanted him to get me a cup of coffee
its a little hot for coffee dont you think
maybe youre right  its been a pleasure
keep an eye on him make sure he leaves town and bennings leave the skag alone
id estimate this vessel has been here for at least two centuries
where are you going
the captain said to learn whatever we could
he also said to keep a low profile
i plan to
didnt mean to startle you
what do you want
my names jonathan archer i saw you this morning paying for that mans casket
i dont know where youre from mister archer but around here no one refers to a skagaran as a man if youll excuse me
can i help you with that
ill manage
its no trouble
ill ask you again what do you want
id like to learn more about the skagarans
everyone knows about the skagarans
there arent any where i come from
wheres that
up north quite a ways
if certain people had their ways there wouldnt be any around here either i heard about what you did in the saloon today deputy bennings has a nasty temper why would your risk getting thrown in jail maybe worse
i dont think that skagarans life is any less valuable than mine
so what do you want with me
well you are the teacher around here arent you the first skagaran i ever saw was today lying in that coffin seems id be more likely to get the truth from you than from the men who put him there
would you like to meet more of them
its all right
captain
bethany these are the friends i told you about
youre from up north too
thats correct
the children will be here soon you said you wanted to learn something mister archer youre welcome to stay for the lesson
thanks
kinda late at night to be teaching school
its illegal to teach skagarans
a ship
whats left of it
we found these in a data module
go back to enterprise see what you can salvage
youre not coming with us
dont want to miss my first day at school
nine times twelve dont forget to carry the one yral
nine times twelve equals one hundred and eight
thats right youre doing very well with your multiplication tables tomorrow night well start with something a little more challenging long division kret collect the slates please ive brought a friend with me whod like to learn more about your people who can tell mister archer how the humans and the skagarans came to live together taliyah
our ancestors took the humans from their planet and brought them here
and why did they do that
to make them work
but the humans didnt want to work for the skagarans did they
no we didnt
go on home now go on its all right
i tried to warn you bethany teaching skags is a crime you know that
nobodys being hurt here
so you say but im afraid the law is the law
i thought you could bend the local ordnances
thats true but this is one i have no intention of bending
get away from me
sheriff gave you a chance to leave town you should have taken it
get away from there go on now
best i can do
thanks whats going to happen to you know
dont worry this isnt the first time the sheriff and i havent seen eye to eye
you didnt get to finish your lesson id like to hear the rest of it
you know the story everyone does
everyone seems to have their own version im curious to hear the way you teach it to the skagarans that wreck at their settlement was that their ship
they used it three hundred years ago to go to earth and bring our ancestors back here they were building colonies they needed workers
you mean slaves
it was a terrible crime
tell me about cooper smith
thats where the stories differ somewhat to the humans hes a folk hero our liberator im sure thats what you were taught but the skagarans they call him rakhtar it means butcher he and his men burned the skagaran ship destroyed their weapons they murdered most of them entire families have you heard that version smith wrote the first laws that kept the skagarans from going to school owning property even marrying
so they could never enslave the humans again
thats how they justified it men like bennings are happy to carry on the tradition
sheriff wants to talk to you
care for a shave mister archer
no thanks
you sure there aint nothing like a barber shave to make a man feel civilised
i feel civilised enough
suit yourself thanks henry
any time sheriff
have a seat skagaran whisky its illegal but ive let henry keep a bottle around for pulling teeth
packs a hell of a wallop  i thought you were heading south to raise bluehorns
thats the plan
then maybe you can tell me why you were out in skagtown in the middle of the night
that a crime
my deputy says you and miss bethany were teaching those children thats a crime
but if i decided to lynch a skagaran thatd be legal
the law was laid down a long time ago to protect men like you and me
protect us from what children
you really want those children to learn how to read how to do their numbers and then maybe they can learn about how they used to be in charge around here how they had guns that could kill a man with a beam of light and the human beings were nothing but their labour force their property is that what you want those children to learn mister archer
youre judging them on something that happened over two hundred years ago
and its my job to make sure it never happens again now im not saying its fair its just the way its always been i expect you to be out of town in an hour
whats going to happen to bethany
shes been warned she knew the consequences minimum sentence is ten years
archer to enterprise
go ahead
captain
any luck with those data modules
several of them were damaged but we managed to access some of the logs
im still working on the translation sir
ill meet you at the landing coordinates in an hour
theres something i have to do first
i was on my way out of town and realised i forgot something
what are you doing
its called a jail break where i come from
its called that here too where do you expect me to go
there are other settlements im sure they could use a good teacher
things wont be any different there
maybe not but you wont be spending ten years in prison
it was archer
they couldnt have gotten far get nash and franklin
archer to enterprise lock the transporter onto my position there are two of us
drop that whatever it is
did anyone see you transport
i didnt exactly have time to find a secluded spot
these are volatile and suspicious people your disappearance may have consequences
ive removed the projectile but her injuries were extensive
will she make it
i believe so there are a few things about her physiology i still dont understand
what do you mean
arent you familiar with this womans ancestry the cranial genes are recessive which explains her human appearance my guess is they came from her maternal grandmother shes one quarter skagaran
you heard the story same as me cooper smith said the skags could move through thin air from one place to another
maybe you ought to get your eyes checked bennings archers a human
hes working with them
you dont know that
what was he doing out in skagtown whyd he stick up for draysik in the saloon yesterday
cause you were being a horses ass
and who was he talking to on that little box he had it was the skags they helped him escape this is what we were afraid of mac theyd try to take over again its time to put an end to this
you have something in mind
i say we ride out there tonight and burn em out i guarantee therell be plenty of volunteers
now you listen to me im not going to murder those people just because some stranger spooked you with a parlour trick now if i get some proof that the skagarans are up to something ill take care of it
youve always been too soft on them mac
and youve always harassed them while ive looked the other way and thats going to change right now as long as you work for me our job is to enforce the law understood
understood
the story she told you was basically true captain the skagaran ship brought them here to provide labour for a colony they were trying to establish
they apparently found the humans suited to survive in this environment
there are a lot of reports of disciplinary problems and then six months after they arrived the logs end
they kidnapped the wrong people
so what do we do theyre humans we cant just leave them here
we cant transport six thousand people back to earth
once weve dealt with the xindi well come back here do what we can to help them for now they deserve to know that earth hasnt abandoned them
we need to talk
and you were born there
i was born in upstate new york spent most of my adult life in san francisco though youve heard of san francisco
pacific coast why didnt you tell us who you were
i wasnt sure how youd react we thought wed better get the lay of the land first
well i cant say i blame you a part of me never believed earth even existed i thought it was something people made up because they couldnt stand living here you taking us back
we cant not right now anyway our ship isnt big enough someday well come back for you you you realise its not the same world your ancestors left a lots changed in three hundred years
youre telling me
weve moved past things like intolerance prejudice
the skagarans abducted my ancestors captain turned them into slaves
that was a long time ago
well we tend to have a long memory when it comes to that sort of thing
the captains been in there quite a while
i imagine the sheriff has a lot of questions
yeah
we did what we had to do
i understand but if you do make it back to earth youre going to have to leave all that behind
its all right these folks arent going to hurt anybody
this is my first officer tpol shes from a planet called vulcan
pleased to meet you
maam
doctor phlox reports that his patient is doing much better
good i thought wed bring mister maccready
have your men drop those guns
lets talk this through bennings
i never was one for talking
trust me you dont want to pick a fight with us deputy
should have thought of that when you threw in with the skags
were not taking sides here
then whered you get that machine and those weapons
these people are from earth bennings
earth youre lying
i can prove it to you just give me a chance
lay down some fire
stay back ill kill her
secure the area  find the captain
were up too high to see it but your town is down there towards the right edge of that mountain range how are you feeling
i feel fine not even a scar
doctor phlox does excellent work
you must think were barbaric all the things humanitys accomplished building ships like this travelling to other world and were still down there shooting each other
the progress on earth it didnt happen overnight
but it was progress all the same youve managed to change we havent even if you could take us back i dont think were ready
it may be a while before were able to start sending ships here my guess is by the time they arrive theyll find things have changed
i think youre giving us too much credit
its happening already i spoke with maccready he agrees that in light of recent events some of your laws might be a little outdated
before people could travel through space to other planets they had to get off the ground first almost forty years after my human ancestors left earth two brothers from ohio became the first human beings to build a successful flying machine their names were orville and wilbur wright would anyone like to see a picture of their airplane you all would well here it is right here and you can see heres orville wright and his brother wilbur is flying the plane now this is the machine that actually made
the most difficult task facing any captain any crew is the loss of a shipmate weve come here to honour one of our own in the time we knew him he showed us just how much one life can truly matter we will never forget what he did for us and for the ship he loved so much we will go forward with renewed determination to complete this mission so that his sacrifice wont just have been for the people on this ship but for all the citizens of earth
we just reroute the system taps compress the antimatter stream before it reaches the injectors
that will stabilise the warp field
every simulation i run comes back with the same result well be able to cruise at warp five point oh with no field fluctuation im talking about a ride so smooth you could build a house of cards on the warp reactor
if we can maintain high warp for extended periods we can cover the expanse more quickly
which boosts our chances of finding the xindi weapon in time
to the left
oh sorry you get me talking about the engines and i forget where i am dont know what it is about finetuning a piece of machinery
lie on your back
you know you made this sound a whole lot worse than it is
advanced neuropressure can place great demands on the body
well i have to say that so far its a piece of cake
we havent gotten to the more challenging postures
well im always up for a challenge
breathe
tucker to the bridge
archer
were all set down here
ill need at least four point nine
to get the plasma hot enough to compress the stream
you heard the man travis four point nine
aye sir four point five four point six four point seven four point eight
the warp field is fluctuating
four point nine
initialising stream compression
damn thats a beautiful sound
field fluctuations have dropped to zero
we just got our second wind
somethings flooding the intake manifolds
drop to impulse
ive lost helm control
trip status
ive got a primary injector flare
im shutting down its not responding captain
the flare is causing a systemwide overload
fires reported on b and c deck emergency crews en route
helm control is still down
analysis
some kind of polaric field approximately eleven thousand kilometres in diameter composition unknown ill need more time to complete a detailed scan
is that what stopped us
its a logical conclusion
keep scanning
numerous injuries throughout the ship mostly minor except for one commander tucker hes been taken to sickbay
the nucleonic particles are being drawn to the hull
polarise the hull plating
i already tried that sir no effect
then purge the intake manifolds and shut all the exhaust ports
phlox to captain archer
go ahead
would you come down to sickbay
on my way run a full sensor scan i want to know what were dealing with
aye sir
report
when we entered the field nucleonic particles flooded the manifolds causing the injector flare if commander tucker hadnt shut down the reactor we could have had a breach
how much time before we can get the engines back online
were still running diagnostics the damage is significant it could take weeks commander tuckers going to have his hands full
youll be supervising the repairs ive just come from sickbay trips in a coma he has extensive neural damage doctor phlox says we have to prepare for the possibility that trip wont survive
how is he
his conditions unchanged id like to show you something this is one of the more interesting members of my little menagerie a lyssarrian desert larvae its epidermal layers secrete a viral suppressant that i use as a salve for cuts and bruises
how does this relate to trip
the larvae have another somewhat more controversial property when implanted with the dna from another species it exactly replicates that species lifecycle albeit at a rapidly accelerated rate
it becomes a clone
essentially but one that is born grows old and dies in approximately fifteen days the lyssarrians call them mimetic simbiots theyre a closely guarded secret very few people know of their existence
and you want to do this with trip use his dna to grow a simbiot
to harvest its neural tissue for transplant theres no guarantee that human dna will stimulate the larvaes growth cycle but as it stands now it may be commander tuckers only hope for survival to ensure the tissues compatibility ill have to wait until the simbiot reaches commander tuckers present physical age then i can excise the tissue from a noncritical region of the simbiots cerebral region it would experience no discernable side effects and should be able to live out its normal life span
its fifteen day life span
i dont make this proposal lightly captain but im obligated to provide you with all available options
come in
we sent out an ev team they retrieved a sample of the substance accumulating on the hull multiple hits with a plasma rifle were required to dislodge it its composed of highly charged particles mostly ferric ions but there are several elements that we cant identify  and its highly magnetic so far the danger to the ship seems negligible
but the longer we remain in the field the more these particles build up do whatever you have to do but we need to get those engines back online
understood regarding the lyssarrian procedure doctor phlox proposed may i ask if youve reached a decision
i approved it
are you aware that the lyssarrian prime conclave has banned the creation of simbiots
we dont answer to the lyssarrian prime conclave
simbiots are living conscious entities well be growing a sentient being for the sole purpose of harvesting tissue
im aware of the ethical implications if we werent in the expanse maybe my decision would be different but weve got to complete this mission earth needs enterprise enterprise needs trip its as simple as that
its rather sensitive to light at this stage by tomorrow morning if all goes well well have a healthy baby boy on our hands
perfect genetic duplicate right down to the birthmark on his right side
he certainly sounds healthy
and hungry excuse me
there there oh its been some time since ive had a newborn but i see i havent lost my touch
three days ago he was just another one of your creatures something you kept on a shelf
hes certainly come a long way in a short time
in a short time hell be a lot older have you thought of where hes going to live
why not right here i cant think of a more stimulating environment for a developing young mind and id be able to keep a close watch on his development
sounds like youve found yourself a new roommate
now all i need to do is find him a name the crews been offering suggestions but nothing sounds right steven enrique dennis dennis you see my dilemma
im sure youll think of something
chief medical officers log after much deliberation i have finally thought of a name for this newest addition to our crew
its all right sim its all right
lucky for me denobulans require little sleep im at a loss as to how human adults endure the rem cycle interruptions that accompany the teething stage though i knew what to expect i cant help but be astonished by sims rapid physical development a side note i may have stumbled across an effective fertiliser for my orsic fern
those who have never seen a living martian can scarcely imagine the strange horror of its a  app  appearance
thats very good
can we just skip to the part where the martian machines attack
we just showed you this book how do you know about the martian machines
my mum read it to me
your mum
uh huh i think its chapter ten
its become quite evident that sims remarkable scholastic progress goes far beyond an aptitude for learning
hes remembering things that happened to trip when trip was this age
so the older he grows the more of trips life hell recall
there are some species that rely solely on genetic sequencing to pass on their cultural memories evidently humans have a similar capacity this could be an important discovery he certainly possesses commander tuckers curiosity this morning he took apart my medical tricorder
hes starting to look like trip
and hes beginning to ask questions where did i come from wheres my mother and father why am i here
its only been three days and hes already beginning to realise how different he is
hes going to have to be told the truth soon
i gave the order that created him i should be the one to explain why
whoa where do you think youre off to
i was trying to teach him to fetch
now dont take it personally fetching isnt his style
im sorry captain i was in the middle of giving porthos his physical i only turned my back for a moment
 its all right is he okay
yes indeed hes in peak physical condition which is more than i can say for myself
its almost time for his dinner  do you want to help me feed him
sure
come on
theres nothing porthos likes more than dinnertime
can he do any tricks
i havent taught him any mostly what he does is eat sleep and not fetch just fill it up half way
okay i used to have a dog his name was bedford he was so big i could ride him like a horse
is that right
thats zephram cochrane he invented warp drive
thats right he did
doctor phlox says your dad helped design the warp five engine
thats a picture of him right there and this is me on my first day of flight school
did you always want to be a starship captain
as long as i can remember
why
its what i was meant to do
bet its a fun job
it has its moments let me show you something
keep the nose up thats right
it pulls a little to the left
trim the port aileron
that feels better my dad says i should be an engineer my mum thinks i should study architecture but i want to do what you do be a starship captain you know whats weird
what
my parents call me trip but everyone here calls me sim wheres my mum and dad are they back on earth
thats a little difficult to answer
its broken
nothing a little glue wont remedy i crashed it plenty of times myself
i miss my parents
come with me
doctor phlox says im not allowed to go in there
its okay
hes trip
thats right
my parents theyre not really mine theyre his
yes
so that time i put a garden snake in lizzies dollhouse that wasnt me
no
so im just some kind of copy of him
youre more than that sim you have trips memories but you also have your own memories the ones youre making here on enterprise
how long have i lived here
you were born only four days ago
i feel older
its hard to understand i know theres part of you something inside you that trip needs doctor phlox is going to have to perform an operation
will it hurt
not at all you wont feel a thing
doctors always say that
when phlox says it its the truth
can we go fix the model now
sure
wave guides for the primary port bypass think ive made some progress
this looks promising
theyre showing a night at the opera tonight marx brothers wondered if youre planning to go
ill be reviewing the field coil equations they need to be finished in time for tomorrows reactor test
oh what about dinner want to grab a bite
i appreciate the offer but im afraid i have to work late into the evening ensign massaro is running a diagnostic on the plasma assembly id like you to assist her
yes maam its because im different isnt it the reason you dont want to do anything with me i guess it must be weird being with someone like me five days ago i was wearing diapers
i simply believe that our attention should be focused on the ships engines at least until the current situation is resolved
i probably wont be around after the current situations resolved
archer to tpol
go ahead
would you please come to my ready room
on my way
warp drive should be functional in two weeks
im afraid that wont be soon enough
sir i
according to malcolm the accumulation on the hull is generating a diamagnetic field its having a dampening effect the more the particulate builds up the more powerful the field becomes in another four days every system on the ship will be offline if we dont make it out of here by then we never will
key lime pie
i suddenly realised it was my favourite dessert now i know why
do these memories just come to you
the older i get the more i remember its like ive lived this whole other life cant explain it
i cant imagine it you wanted to ask me about something
yeah i did do you think its possible to redirect the phase cannons so they can fire back onto the hull
i suppose so why
i want to try and blast off enough of that particulate so we can open up the launch bay doors
is someone planning on going somewhere
all we need to do is build up enough momentum to can get the ship out of here right
right
well weve got two perfectly good engines sitting in the launch bay if we string a couple of grappler lines between the shuttlepods and the ship we can tow ourselves clear
the shuttlepods dont generate that kind of thrust wed never build up enough momentum to get clear of the field in time
leave that to me
can i come in did you have a chance to look at my calculations
i reviewed them thoroughly
and
a fusion overburn has never been attempted with a shuttlepod engine
that doesnt mean it wont work
i agree despite the risks i believe its our best option
so youre going to recommend the plan to the captain
i already have was there something else
you and trip used to spend a lot of time here together
i was instructing him in the practice of vulcan neuropressure
i remember we were lying right there working the neural nodes on each others feet talking about the warp engines how i was hoping to modify them
how commander tucker was hoping to modify them
right commander tucker you know he was really starting to enjoy those sessions with you
they were helping him sleep
im not sure thats the only reason
what do you mean
was there ever anything between you and trip
if youre referring to a romantic relationship no
the reason i ask is well youre all i think about if you know what i mean and im not talking about an adolescent crush that was well that was two days ago this is much more serious the way i feel about you anyway whats driving me crazy is i dont know if these feelings are mine or his
i cant answer that
i didnt mean to make you feel uncomfortable
im not uncomfortable
i just thought i should tell you this while i still had the chance
come in
i want to pilot one of the shuttlepods
thats out of the question
its my plan i think i should have a say in how its implemented
this is a dangerous procedure youve never flown a shuttlepod before
yes i have trip has thousands of hours of flying time and i have his memories
i cant jeopardise this ship on the strength of those memories mayweather and reed will pilot the shuttlepods i want you to coordinate from the bridge tpol will assist you
youre worried somethingll happen to me arent you you want to make sure im around because you need part of my brain
yeah thats part of it
so your concern for my safety is really about saving trip
my main concern is that this plan work if we dont make it out of here in the next six hours it wont matter if trip survives or not well all be dead
ive realigned the targeting scanners theyre set for close proximity
phase cannons are charged and ready
try the doors
theyre still frozen
archer to shuttlepods one and two
you are clear to launch
acknowledged
shuttlepod two acknowledged
whenever youre ready
set the overrun ratio well start at oh point one seven five
acknowledged
oh point one seven five
prepare to initiate on my mark now
one thousand kilodynes
thrust vector holding steady
come on
two thousand kilodynes engine temperatures rising
im reading zero forward momentum
two thousand five hundred kilodynes
engine temperatures nearing critical
were still not moving
come on
increase the overburn ratio another
thirty percent
captain
go ahead
increasing thirty percent
ive got a temperature warning light
im reading five hundred degrees above critical
their systems are overloading
sim
a few more seconds
they wont last a few seconds
sorry sim archer to the shuttlepods
were moving point six two kilometres per hour
twelve kilometres per hour and accelerating
how much do we need
at this speed well emerge from the field in six point one hours
thats good enough archer to shuttlepods one and two come on home  well done
thanks captain
you wanted to see me
theres been a development
im listening
sim wont survive the transplant
you told me you could remove the tissue without harming him
that assessment was based on simbiots grown from lyssarrian dna my tests on sim show that human based simbiots are not as resilient if i excise the quantity of neural tissue i need to save commander tucker sim will die im sorry captain
your shift ended ninety minutes ago
just want to get these initiators in place
youve been working for eighteen straight hours
if you had five days left would you spend them sleeping besides tomorrow morning im walking into sickbay to donate some of my unneeded neural tissue which means that pretty soon ill be answering to the real trip and if i know him hes going to want these engines in as good a shape as they can be
i havent commended you on the successful implementation of your plan you saved the ship
i appreciate that
lyssarrian desert larva
i wanted to learn something about my own species so ive been doing a little research mostly on lifespans did you know that at one time in history human beings lived an average of only thirty five years the average vulcan lifespan was only forty
your point
just that both species expend a lot of effort to change those statistics i guess its just natural for people to want to stick around for as long as possible
why not give up my life ive only got five six days left anyway
that isnt how we see it
let me ask you something doc when you researched lyssarrian larvae did you come across any references to the velandran circe
they were a group of lyssarrian scientists who conducted illegal experiments on simbiots they claimed to have developed an enzyme that stopped the rapid aging process
is there any truth to it
why do you think he kept it a secret
doctor
the enzyme is experimental with very little empirical evidence to suggest that it works thats why i didnt mention it
theres not much evidence but it exists the fact is i may not have to grow old and die in a week theres a chance that i can live out a normal lifespan i cant change what happened to him but maybe i can change whats going to happen to me
come in
how long have you been staying here
i was on the way to my room last night but i came here instead
these are trips quarters
which is where i belong i have his memories i have his feelings i have his body how am i not trip
commander tucker is lying in sickbay
then what am i just something you grew in a lab does that make it easier for you to condemn me to death
if you refuse to go through with this youll be condemning trip to death
i didnt put him in a coma
no but you can save him
in a way i will by saving myself
phlox says theres almost no chance that the enzyme will work
my life is at stake any chance is worth taking
but at what cost itll take a day to synthesise the enzyme by that time your neural tissue wont be compatible with trips anymore hell die
i know
i cant let that happen
so what are you going to do drag me down to sickbay force me onto a biobed at gunpoint
if you truly have all of trips memories you know the answer to that i dont have to tell you whats at stake i must complete this mission and to do that i need trip trip ill take whatever steps necessary to save him
even if it means killing me
even if it means killing you
youre not a murderer
dont make me one
i was wondering if theres anything i can still do maybe theres a panel i can install or something ive got a few hours to kill before my operation
you wish to spend your last hours in engineering
why not the two things i care most about are in this room
if youd like the a3 injector port needs replacing
ill get right on it
whats the problem
someones rerouted the launch bay controls were shut out
archer to the launch bay come in
captain im reading one person in there
i was all ready to do it
what stopped you
where the hell was i going to go were nowhere near any habitable planet didnt really want to spend the rest of my life floating around in a shuttlepod which doesnt even have any toilet facilities can you imagine a lousier way to spend your old age cooped up in that thing peeing in a bottle actually i can imagine a worse fate
what would that be
being stuck in there with malcolm damn this is a screwed up situation
i cant argue with you there
a lifetime in eight days its not that im scared of dying its just that i cant imagine not being here tomorrow you want to know what really stopped me
what
my sister and she was my sister as much as trips
i believe that
i dont want what happened to her to happen to anyone else
thats why i gave the order to create you
do me a favour when this is over if commander tucker decides to do any more modifications to the engines tell him to watch his ass
yes
were ready for you
on my way
may i come in i just wanted to say how much your absence will affect the crew how much it will affect me
i appreciate that all in all i guess ive had a pretty good life
i couldnt have asked for a better going away present
im sorry i doubted you doc
no need to apologise
im serious you see i dont just remember trips childhood i remember mine you made a damn good father
you were a damn good son
you said to me once that commanding a starship was what you meant to do i guess this is what i was meant to do good luck captain
thanks
you owe me one
we will never forget what he did for us and for the ship he loved so much we will go forward with renewed determination to complete this mission so that his sacrifice wont just have been for the people on this ship but for all the citizens of earth
hello
have you made your selection
yeah yeah its all set just like we discussed
well be expecting you
and the money same as last time right
the same be careful with the sedative you nearly killed the last one
one hundred milligrams dont worry ill get it right
well be expecting you
looking for a date honey
maybe with your friend
you dont know what youre missing
ooo what can i do for you sweetheart
hey i know you from this morning you brought me the apple juice
what
at the clinic
oh yeah now i remember small world huh
want me to get in
sure yeah
bye girl see you tomorrow
theres a nice place to park right in the neighbourhood turn left at the next light
georgia tandy o negative
how the hell would you remember that
er its another two blocks
if thats drugs i am not interested what you got in there
come here
there you go there you go
its okay they said they wont hurt you
yes
loomis
there you go nice and comfy
good boy cheese
this is your last piece
its okay howve you been jon
about time you showed up our missions changed quite a bit since the last time i saw you but i suppose youre aware of it
i am
maybe you could fill in a few of the blanks for me the xindi weapon would be a good place to start
we dont know any more than you do
i thought you and your colleagues were supposed to be keeping an eye on the time line youre from the thirtieth century hasnt all this happened already
history doesnt mention anything about a conflict between humans and xindi
how could that be
the events that are taking place are the result of temporal incursions they are not supposed to be happening
but they are happening
yes they are but the outcome hasnt reached us yet it takes a while for changes to ripple through the time line
the time traveller the man the suliban worked for
what about him
hes the one who told us about the weapon being built should i believe him
you have no reason not to
you said im supposed to play some crucial part in history does this have something to do with it
i wish i could say that it does but i dont know i told you none of this was supposed to happen
youre not being very helpful why are you here
weve detected three xindi where theyre not supposed to be
this expanse is filled with xindi
im not talking about the expanse im talking about detroit michigan a hundred and fifty years ago
sorry to get you up but this couldnt wait
come in
i just had a visit from daniels i think all your doubts about time travel are about to go out the window
meaning
daniels and his team have discovered three reptilians on earth in the early twenty first century he wants to send us back to find out what theyre doing
us
he told me i could bring one person no more
if daniels is the time traveller he claims to be why doesnt he find our for himself
it took him a long while to get permission to interact with me there are clearances he said it would take too much time
i would think he would have all the time in the world
he said the three xindi travelled to earth from our century theyve been there for two months theyre not sightseeing tpol we have to find out what theyre up to
how are we supposed to accomplish this
he wants us to meet him in the command centre at oh eight hundred tomorrow  come on boy check the database find something to wear that wont stand out in 2004
last time daniels sent you to another century you had one hell of a time getting back
he gave me this said hed return us whenever we signalled him
these are temporal tags we can use them to bring back anything that doesnt belong there
if anyone asks where you went what should i tell them with two shuttlepods in the bay itll be hard to explain
im sure youll think of something try to stay out of trouble
you too
heres the duty roster
we just travelled ninety light years back to earth
and a hundred and fifty years into the past
forgive me if im not entirely convinced
you will be come on
this one has a motion activated security system this one too
were in
this apparatus it appears to have been designed to incapacitate the vehicle
sunday the tristate speedway an allstar lineup of all your favourite monster mayhem
have you ever operated a vehicle from this period
i can pilot a starship r n d 2 3 4
i suggest you begin with two
foot controls
i dont believe youve activated your external lighting
what year is that map from
2002 it was the closest i could find in the starfleet database
the layout shouldnt have changed a lot in two years
turn starboard on twenty fourth street
if that thing has a scanning radius of three kilometres how far are we going to have to drive to cover the entire city
i have created a search grid that requires a journey of approximately eighty kilometres but its probably well find them before we complete it
whats that icon
its a gasoline pump we need to get fuel
where
where isnt the problem were going to need money us currency
thats going to be difficult at this time of night
not necessarily
people used to go to jail for this
well return what we dont use
yeah
are you vaughan strode
who are you
im from the blood bank we had a screwup this afternoon we gave you the wrong papers to sign
im not giving the money back
no no no they dont want the money back in fact theyre going to pay you again twenty five bucks they just need you to sign the right papers
you bring them
no they wouldnt let me youve got to do it in front of the supervisor you know the fat broad that paid you they sent me to drive you down
its eleven oclock at night
yeah i know they want to send your blood work out first thing in the morning and they cant do it without the right paperwork you want the twenty five bucks or not
this going to take long i dont want to miss conan
were they aware at this time that earths supply of fossil fuel was nearing depletion
they had been for thirty years but it wasnt until 2061 that they finally
one kilometre straight ahead
second structure from the left three xindi biosigns
any humans
five in another part of the building
this doesnt look very residential set your phase pistol to kill when the reptilians boarded enterprise stun had no effect see what you can find out ill look over there
go ahead
theres a neutronic power source coming from the first floor
ive found a gate with an electric locking mechanism we shouldnt have a problem do you see the vehicle
i see it
yes
loomis
did you disinfect your hands
i insert ivs all day i told you that if there are any infections here it wont be because of me you forget something
weve decided to compensate you for the final three patients in one payment
well thats not what we agreed you said id get paid for each one
bring us the last two blood types and you will be compensated
we should wait a while a few more days at least there was something on the news cops are starting to get some complaints that people have gone missing
we cant wait a few more days we need the last two
look as soon as they figure out that all these people here have been to the clinic it wont take a rocket scientist to point the finger at me
then i suggest you finish your work quickly
look i dont know what you guys are up to and i dont want to know its not my business but the cops dont take kindly to people who help terrorists i gotta be real careful
we will double your fee for the final three but the last two must be here by tomorrow
double tomorrow yeah all right ill have them here by tomorrow
here he comes
ninth floor  two hundred and eighty pounds  william myers second floor
and the man in the wheelchair why were you bringing him to an abandoned factory in the middle of the night
i swear i dont know what youre talking about
whats this
oh i took that from the clinic i work at the blood bank on porter street check with them theyll tell you ive been there for over a year
why would you take it
make a few extra bucks theres plenty of people on the street looking for that stuff
really why would anyone on the street be interested in acquiring methohexitol
you make it a habit of climbing out your window when someone knocks on the door
i dont like cops
tell us about your friends on carpenter street
ive never been to carpenter street
you were there an hour ago with the man in the wheelchair now tell me whos inside that factory
i told you i dont know what youre talking about i think its time you find me a lawyer
untie him
you heard him untie me
thats better
i didnt feel right doing that with you tied up carpenter street
youre not allowed to hit me
untie him again
no no no no wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute i dont know who he is i swear to god a doctor maybe says hes working on a vaccine experimental he doesnt have approval or something like that so he needed me to bring him people
does it seem logical to you that legitimate medical research is being conducted in an abandoned factory
i thought about that just tonight i thought maybe hes some kind of terrorist but i swear if i knew that for a fact i never would have agreed to help him
in one individual weve managed to find the worst qualities of this era greed violence moral corruption
but he said he wasnt going to hurt anybody i just saw them an hour ago theyre all okay
how many
five no no six the wheelchair guy was number six
how did this doctor find you
i told you i work at the blood bank he wanted someone from every blood type eight blood types eight people he figured i had access to that kind of information
did he also figure that youd have no compunctions about abducting people
whats he paying you
five thousand apiece double for the last three
is that what human life is worth in the twenty first century
i told you he said he wasnt going to hurt any of them
what does he look like
he only calls me on the phone i saw him a couple of times but he stays in the shadows you know hes kind of tall thats all i can tell you why dont you let me go i swear to you i will never do it again
you are going to do it again that is if you have any hope of staying out of prison
what are you talking about
these two files ab positive and b negative theyre the final two
yeah
well then youre looking at your next victim a healthy male with b negative blood
if you think youre going to be in there a long time we should get something to eat first
be quiet
come on im not talking about anything fancy a burger a taco theres a drivethrough less than a mile from here cops have to eat dont they what is the matter with you two ill pay
i told you to be quiet
what side of the street is it on
welcome to burgerland how may i serve you sir
ill have the double superbeef no lettuce
one double superbeef without lettuce please
you can make that a triple for only forty cents extra
do it
a double will be fine
would you like to make that a combo
yeah fries and a medium root beer
will there be anything else today
a hamburger ketchup only
you can make that a double for only forty cents extra
no thank you
would you like to make that a combo
no no combo
will there be anything else today
does the fiesta salad contain animal products
no but we can add three strips of bacon for only seventy five cents more
nothing for me thank you
youre sure
quite
you guys dont mind do you im starving you know itd make it a lot easier if youd untie my hands its not like im going anywhere
do the best you can
uh oh i told you let me get that for you oh boy
youre a veggie i forgot why dont you take a fry theyre probably okay have it your way
theyll come in to take fresh blood samples every hour they readminister the sedative every six hours i recommend you do whatever youre going to do before then
number seven
which one is it
b b negative youll have ab positive by tomorrow night i swear
make certain i do
engage the engine and proceed to the second location
nice ray gun am i supposed to believe that things for real
drive
ten grand a piece for the last three and im not going to see a penny of it
dont speak until were out of visual range
fifteen millilitres from the new arrival
you catch these guys and i get immunity right were not talking about copping to a lesser charge
when my associate returns well discuss the details
hey im taking a big chance here okay if your associate doesnt catch them theyre going to come looking for me okay you two have to keep your word
youve been abducting people for money and youre questioning our honesty
sit back
relax just getting a smoke
what are you doing
i dont know about you honey but im a little tense know what i mean
extinguish that now
if you want some air open your window
now
stay exactly where you are
tpol
they brought a bioreactor with them theyre synthesising some kind of viral agent
rajiin warned us about a bioweapon this could be it
why would they travel back through time
daniels said they might be hiding from someone
the past seems like a pretty good place to hide
weve got to keep them from getting it back to our time
are you in a position to disable all three of them
i dont know i was thinking about trying to take out the bioreactor but i could end up spreading whatevers in there across half the city
they must have some kind of temporal beacon if you can destroy it theyll have no way of getting back
ive got to find it first
modify your scanner to a delta band frequency that should help you locate the signal from the temporal beacon
theyve gone out the west door they could be headed for the street they have the virus
tpol
yes captain
theyre in the west alley way north of the main
building i could use some help
acknowledged
drive
trouble
drive
pull over and stop here
they give you all that fancy equipment and what good does it do you
lower your window
i knew your partners plan wouldnt work
be quiet theyre coming
stop
come on
hes trying to release the toxin
weve eliminated his only means of returning to his own century perhaps he has no other choice
if hes trying to destroy humanity hes not going to be able to do it with that they only modified the virus for six blood types
if they can infect three quarters of earths population its unlikely humans will pose a threat to them in the future
lets hope he cant see in the dark keep laying down fire
dont move a muscle drop it why a second weapon where were you going to take it
we wont allow you to destroy us your species is doomed
lets go
problem sir
its done
sir
archer to lieutenant reed
go ahead
get a team down to the command centre on the double
aye sir
wait here for malcolm have everything brought to cargo bay two ive got to get this to phlox
whats going on
come with me
get out of the car
hes on something
get out of the car
keep your hands where we can see them
come on come on
whats going on
hey hey hey i didnt do anything
we got a tip says you did
youre just lucky all six of them are still alive
those two cops who came to my place they offered me a deal thats the only reason i helped them
i dont know what youre talking about get him out of here
those creature the lizard people theyre around here somewhere youve got to find them
no problem well get right on that
be careful be careful theyve got ray guns
ray guns got it
watch your head
its identical to the other two even the smallest features are exactly the same
like they came off an assembly line
id like to see the factory that made these well thats the last sensor sweep should give tpol plenty to chew on for a while
power fluctuations
i think were getting the hang of this
were coming up on the outer edge of the cloaking barrier
theyre emerging heading back to their ship
visual
i want to know what kind of armaments theyre carrying we may have found what were looking for
this new data should help us map the anomalies more accurately i should also be able to calculate the exact number of spheres in the expanse
any new theories on their purpose
not yet
bridge to captain archer
archer here
weve picked up a vessel approaching at impulse theyre transmitting a distress signal
theyre trapped in a cluster of anomalies theyve taken engine damage
lets see them
twenty three biosigns
hail them this is captain jonathan archer of the starship enterprise can we assist you
enterprise weve suffered heavy damage our engines are inoperative our life support system is failing please assist us
what kind of weapons do they have
minimal
can you get us through the anomalies
i believe i can plot a safe course
full impulse
their life support systems failed
take full security precautions make sure none of them are armed
youll be fine next case please
thank you doctor
how are they
im unable to perform detailed bioscans
why
they have an aversion to any kind of invasive medical care for religious reasons however i have managed to ascertain that aside from some minor injuries and one slight case of malnutrition they appear to be fine
theyre no strangers to anomalies that looks like an old scar
i found similar injuries on four others apparently theyve been in the vicinity of the sphere for several months
which ones the captain
he prefers the term prinam a religious designation
im captain archer welcome aboard
my name is djamat i cant express how grateful we are you saved our lives
i understand youve been in this region for quite some time
yes were on a pilgrimage to the twelfth sphere its taken us a year to make the journey
your ships in pretty rough shape my engineers taking a look at it
its an old vessel but sturdy unfortunately we are better at prayer than we are at space travel
maybe theres some information about the spheres we can share if youre feeling up to it id like you to have dinner with me and my science officer tonight
id be honoured to accept your hospitality captain
our home world is called triannon its six point three light years from here in the maradas star cluster have you heard of it
doesnt ring a bell were new to the expanse
the expanse you mean the chosen realm
i think were talking about the same thing were here to learn everything about a species you may have run into the xindi
im not familiar with them we place very little emphasis on meeting other lifeforms space travel for us is merely a means to bring us closer to the spheres
youve studied them for some time
were not here to study the spheres were here to venerate them we believe that it is through prayer and meditation that the makers become manifest
the makers
the creators of the spheres ive felt their presence here
youre referring to spatial anomalies
the makers breath it reshapes reality allows ordinary men a glimpse of the divine
that breath nearly destroyed your ship
well we became careless its easy to do when youre in the presence of a sphere
theyre certainly impressive weve found three of them so far
youre fortunate to have such a fast ship i regret that ill die having seen only one of the many thousands of spheres
actually weve determined that there are fifty nine spheres in the expanse
i think your estimates are a bit low
thats doubtful
with the makers there is no doubt
doubt is the basis of all scientific progress
scientific progress has led many people astray
perhaps this is a subject we should discuss some other time
i agree captain
youll be glad to know my engineer believes that he can repair the damage to your vessel he thinks it shouldnt take more than a couple of days
that is good news i certainly hope that well have the opportunity to repay your kindness
may i help you
id like to speak with you
what is it are you feeling ill
i wanted to ask you about a certain procedure im sorry its very difficult for me to talk about
why dont you have a seat i was about to make some janaran tea would you like some
yes thank you
is everyone in place
yes theyre just waiting for your signal
you sound hesitant
im sorry prinam but are you certain this is the right thing to do
do you think this ship just came to us by coincidence this encounter was clearly ordained by the makers
but these people risked their lives to save us
they desecrated a sphere what we are about to do is not just for our salvation but for theirs as well i know it can be difficult weve been away from home for a long time but we have been given the means to end the bloodshed for once and for all dont lose your faith now yarrick
never prinam
they believe that godlike beings they call the makers created the spheres a thousand years ago
we have determined that the spheres are nearly a thousand years old
well they also believe that the makers are using the spheres to reshape the expanse creating a paradise for when they return
mythology often has a basis in fact
come in
am i disturbing you
not at all
excuse me
i said before that i hoped to be able to repay your kindness
that isnt necessary
its already underway captain archer you your crew this vessel are all about to embark on a glorious mission at this moment a number of my people have taken positions around your vessel their bodies have been equipped with powerful organic explosives with a single command i can order any one of them to sacrifice their lives
cala detash shika venus tikel shika venus tikel shika venus tikel
theres been an explosion on c deck weve got a hull breach
seal off the area get security teams
stop two of my men are positioned next to your warp reactor unless you turn this ship over to me ill destroy it
he has severe burns the other two are suffering from the effects of rapid decompression they need immediate medical attention
my orders are to escort everyone to their quarters
i will not leave without treating these people
watch him
they say theyll destroy enterprise i have to believe them
i cant believe youre going along with this
remember whats at stake why were out here right now we dont have a choice dont take any action against them is that clear
aye captain
this isnt over
make yourself at home
you made the right decision i promise you your people wont be harmed
you just murdered one of my people
i had to erase any doubts you might have had about our resolve
what do you want with my ship
when im satisfied the situation is secure ill answer your questions i also lost a crewman in that explosion captain ill say a prayer for them both
save your breath
were you given the coordinates for triannon set a course your highest warp factor  prepare to fire two of your torpedoes target my ships reactor you heard me release the docking clamps
a strike here will cut off their supply route
no i dont want a victory by attrition were going to assault their positions directly
if you use enterprise to attack your enemies you may prevail but your war will not end  vulcan was once torn by violent conflict numerous factions with opposing doctrines on logic each decisive victory drove the defeated faction underground until they could regroup and fight again the cycle perpetuated itself for centuries only when we embraced nonviolence did we achieve peace
we also plan to embrace nonviolence as soon as the heretics are eliminated
thats illogical its not possible to eradicate everyone who disagrees with you
with the help of the makers all things are possible
i promised you an explanation i owe you that
where are you taking this ship
to my homeworld well be there in three days for the last century a violent group of heretics have tried to undermine our way of life with your ship i can deliver a final decisive attack i can end this conflict forever
a war that was the glorious mission you were talking about
im trying to save my people
why do i have the feeling these heretics would say the same thing
they might very well but it doesnt change what they are enemies of the truth
your truth
theres only one
how many people do you intend to kill with my ship
your species is obsessed with numbers a characteristic of your misguided belief that the secrets of the universe can be revealed through science this may sound barbaric to you but it doesnt matter how many heretics die when the makers return only the faithful will survive nonbelievers will be swept away not only triannons but every race within the chosen realm
doctrines like that make it real easy to wipe out everyone who doesnt agree with you
youre wrong its not easy if it were i wouldnt be dreading what i have to do next ive been reviewing your records youve committed terrible acts of desecration not only have you flown within the cloaking barrier of three spheres youve landed on one and entered another for crimes of this magnitude my faith obligates me to destroy your ship and put your crew to death however i cannot ignore the fact that you put yourselves at risk to save us and that i like you captain i believe youre an honourable man so i am going against what my faith dictates im going to temper the punishment as commander of this ship you may choose one member of your crew to give up their life
youre out of your mind
if you wont choose ill choose for you i take no pleasure in this captain believe me
i need time to think about this
you have six hours i urge you to use this time to search within yourself and put these lies out of your mind all of this data that youve collected must be erased from existence
six hours captain
an update on the repairs to your ship djamat felt you should be kept appraised
thats very considerate of him wait a minute your names yarrick isnt it
it is
i understand your wife paid a visit to sickbay she had a long talk with my doctor shes pregnant
yes
i guess you also know she wants to end the pregnancy
thats between her and me
my doctor got the impression that she doesnt exactly agree with djamats interpretation of your faith as a matter of fact phlox said shes grown to hate everything about it
thats not true
he also got the impression that youre not happy with the way things are going either
djamat is my spiritual leader i will follow him to my death
from what ive seen im pretty sure youre going to have that opportunity
you went to the doctor youve put us at risk he told his captain
does djamat know
i dont think so did you have the procedure
no the doctor said he needed time to review our physiology hes under guard now its too late
its just as well
have you changed your mind
im not certain its the right thing to do
i wont watch my son or daughter fight in djamats war
we have the ship now well end the war once and for all
you dont believe that any more than i do
enter ah im glad youve come i was just looking at your captains logs i had no idea we were such kindred spirits
what makes you think that
i know why youre here in the expanse it turns out were both fighting to save our people
im trying to stop my world from being destroyed youre trying to wipe out everyone who doesnt share your beliefs
our situations arent as different as you think
i draw the line at murdering innocent people
and not torture in your log there is an incident with a prisoner an interrogation that made use of an airlock
i needed information critical to my mission he wasnt hurt
i sympathise with you captain ive had to make hard choices as well when i was young i fought with the holy regiments i was commanding a mission wed infiltrated a village known to be a heretic stronghold we were instructed to stay concealed and relay intelligence about enemy movements but one of the villagers discovered us it was a small boy no more than six years old we knew if we let him go he would alert the village and if we tried to hold him he might give us away there was only one action to take so i took it
youre proud of that
in the service of the makers all actions are blessed ones
there are no makers at least not how you perceive them the spheres are machines built for a reason you and i dont understand
i was once like you but then i felt the breath i prayed for you captain i had hoped that the makers would open your eyes to the truth but it seems that theyve turned away you had a choice to make
ive made it
and which crew member have you selected
ive chosen myself you wanted to kill someone kill me
i urge you to reconsider
i wont make someone else pay for something that happened under my command
but what about your mission when im through with your ship your crew will need their captain
tpols a fine commander
we are more alike than you think captain i would make the same choice i respect your decision
then maybe youll grant a request
what is it
my people have certain customs regarding death theres a device on board we use it to dispose of hazardous materials but on rare occasions when the situation arises weve also used it for executions its considered humane
where is this device
the molecules have been disassembled quick and painless
i cant chance your mind
no more than i can change yours
very well proceed
captain
ask phlox to keep an eye on porthos take care of enterprise
this wont end here
you have my sympathies you should inform your crew they deserve to know
youve been quiet
im just thinking about whats ahead prinam
i know you too well tell me whats wrong
weve just begun this mission and already three people are dead
and that bothers you
shouldnt it these people are not our enemy
they are nonbelievers that makes them our enemy
why
do you believe the makers speak through me
yes
then when you question me you question the makers and theres a word for that heresy yarrick when you begin to sympathise with the enemy you risk becoming the enemy
dont feed him cheese can you talk
go ahead
can you neutralise the organic explosives
need triannon internal scans
can i help you
i know medical scans are against your beliefs i dont think the makers will mind
enter
lyaals missing hes not at his station
lyaal lyaal well use the ships internal sensors to find him
i need to locate one of my men
were dropping out of warp
main power is being disrupted
from where
i cant identify the location
im telling you i didnt do anything ask your flunky over here hes been looking over my shoulder the whole time
its true he never left my sight
this did not happen by accident
prinam theres something wrong with the eps manifolds on deck d section j15
yarrick go with him
its on the left
you past it
you dont want to do that
you cant win theyll destroy the ship
not if you help me
no
you know this is wrong everything hed doing we can put a stop to it all of it
i wont betray my faith
your faith betrayed you is this really what the makers want to kill people by the thousands in their name is that the faith you were raised in
no
then do whats right if you dont help me youll be condemning your wife and child to death because thats how this is going to end as long as people like djamat dictate whats true and what isnt all youll ever have is war
have you located lyaal
internal sensors arent functioning systems are down all over the ship
what is it
theres a convoy of ships approaching
let me see them
these people youre fighting what makes them heretics
we believe the makers created the chosen realm in nine days they believe it took ten
for that youve been at war for over a century found it
what is it
the environmental controls need to be rerouted to sickbay that can only be done from the bridge im going to show you how to do it
why
doctor phlox has synthesised an airborne agent it neutralises one of the enzymes used in the organic explosives renders it inert
theyre hailing us
surrender now
i have four ships
if you had ten ships you wouldnt survive against this vessel run your scans youll see that im telling the truth surrender and youll be treated fairly
you consider us heretics we know what you do to them djamat
target the lead vessel do what i say
no
prepare to fire torpedoes
one of the ships has lost engines
target their main reactor
dont worry its harmless unless its agitated
captain
we have to get to the armoury were retaking the ship we need the macos
prinam
its begun whats the status of the engines
weve located the problem its under repair the warp reactor should be functioning in a few hours
theyre retreating
stay with them
do what i say  bring us within firing distance prepare to lock weapons
careful theres no antidote for the venom
therell be an extra helping of snow beetles for you tonight young lady
their engines are at maximum were still gaining
good well eliminate them one by one
hold your fire
dont move
theyre coming into range
lock weapons
theyre sending a transmission they want to surrender
continue firing
weapons arent functioning
archer to the bridge weve rerouted command functions to engineering ive taken weapons offline
find him
weve also neutralised your organic explosives
youre lying
go ahead try to blow yourself up
ill wait
stand down before anyone else gets hurt
you know i wont do that
prinam theyre coming about
theyre firing again captain i suggest you bring your weapons back online are you willing to sacrifice the lives of your crew
captain its reed we have the bridge thisd be a lot easier if i had weapons back
stand by
hail them
this is captain archer djamat is no longer in control of this vessel please respond weve retaken the ship im in command again
why should i believe you
im powering down my weapons see for yourself
theyre moving off
we just entered orbit around triannon lets go
youve done a terrible thing captain youve interfered with something that was ordained after centuries of fighting i was going to bring an end to the war we would have had peace
peace one of my crewmen is dead six others are wounded my ship is damaged
none of that is important all that matters is the sacred truth
you want truth ill show you some truth
from what weve been able to learn this happened eight months ago both sides have been decimated there are no major cities left millions are dead your faith was going to bring peace here it is
yes
commander shran would you come to the bridge
status
weve lost the warp trail
continue scanning you know what were looking for lieutenant it shouldnt be that difficult to find
commander weve been searching for weeks
and well continue searching until weve accomplished our mission
or until were destroyed youve seen what this place is like what are the chances theyve survived
we have our orders
we should head back to andoria while were still able
you sound like youre afraid of this expanse lieutenant id expect that from a vulcan not a member of the imperial guard
continue scanning
dont underestimate these pinkskins lieutenant theyre still out there
where are the others
delayed
i said the matter was urgent
typical humanoid arrogance you expect us to come scurrying whenever it suits you
im sorry to inconvenience you but im sure youll find the journey worth the effort
the weapon is ready
not quite
then why are you wasting our time
the new prototype has been completed weve scheduled a test
when
three days youll be able to view the test remotely from this chamber if everything goes as planned we should be ready to deploy the final version in a month maybe sooner
and the human threat will finally be eliminated
i hope you find that worth your time
the signal was so weak i wasnt even sure it was there at first
but you are now
yes sir the isotopic signature matches the kemocite that you planted on the xindi ship
set a course tell trip i want everything he can give me from the engines
captain as you know ensign sato and i have been working to reconstruct our database
and
weve managed to dig about thirty percent of our lost data out of the redundant memory core
enough to begin piecing together a map of the spatial anomalies the signal lies just beyond a dense field of them
here
how long to go around it
a field this massive seventeen days at warp five
alert the crew its going to get rough
tucker to the bridge
go ahead
ive got the warp reactor buttoned up
were as ready as well ever be
acknowledged tpol
ive charted the largest anomalies but the field is extremely dense we may not be able to avoid all of them
do your best travis take us in one half impulse
aye sir
come to bearing two seven five mark eight hard to port
we just grazed it no damage
just how accurate is this map of yours
considering i only have thirty percent of our database to work with theres an anomaly forming directly ahead its expanding
expanding
ive never seen this before theyre merging building on one another
which way subcommander
its growing too rapidly
emergency power to hull plating brace for impact
were losing hull integrity atmospheres venting on d deck
come about get us out of here
the helms not responding
weve been completely enveloped
main powers going down
sir im picking up something out there i think its a ship
can you identify it
theres too much distortion
a tractor beams locked on to us weve been pulled out
theyre hailing us
i guess we owe someone a thankyou
captain archer look at the trouble youve gotten your pink skin into this time
youre braver than i imagined i wouldnt try to traverse an anomaly field in a ship this fragile
you dont seem to be having any trouble
weve discovered a few tricks to deal with them
how did you locate us
we have a record of your warp signature from our last encounter our ships are considerably faster than enterprise it wasnt difficult to catch up with you
that explains how you got here it doesnt explain why
your world was brutally attacked the imperial guard thought youd be grateful to have an ally considering no one else came rushing to your aid
and how did the imperial guard know earth had been attacked
seven million killed not exactly a state secret
especially if youre monitoring communications between starfleet and the vulcan high command
what happened to your uniform subcommander not that i dont find your new look becoming but its not exactly regulation is it
i resigned my commission
yes i believe i heard something about that
why are you here
your world is in jeopardy and where are your friends the vulcans where is their mighty fleet they couldnt even spare one officer she was forced to abandon her career to remain on your ship a remarkably selfless act for a vulcan but weve come to your aid weve come into the expanse when they refused were here to help you if you dont want our assistance well leave you to deal with the xindi on your own just like the vulcans have done
targeting sensors are down hull plating were damn lucky the torpedoes were all in safe mode if one of them had detonated
phase cannons
they havent even got enough power to light a camp fire
how long to fix them
i couldnt even guess without a chance to sort this out
commander shran offered to send his tactical officer over to help
wed be giving them access to critical systems sir
the kemocite signal hoshi picked up could lead us to the xindi weapon were going to need our defences i dont like the idea of having the andorians down here any more than you do but we could use their help
aye sir
the andorian shuttle has docked
good lets put them to work
i recommend we assign a security detail to each repair crew
you been talking to lieutenant reed theyre here to help tpol
that doesnt mean we shouldnt exercise caution
im not going to ask them to work with guns at their heads just because you dont like them
i neither like nor dislike andorians ive simply had a great deal of experience with them
i appreciate that but whatever problems exist between vulcan and andoria dont involve us
not at the moment we werent always so antagonistic captain in fact despite their heightened emotions our first contact with andorians seemed promising
what happened
they were duplicitous they only honoured agreements that didnt conflict with their interests
is that your assessment or the high commands
considering the importance of this mission i feel compelled to point out that theyve proven untrustworthy in the past
i dont trust them either tpol but based on my experience i think i can trust commander shran
coffee black
no tea
yeah no crumpets either thank you i need all the caffeine i can get whats the situation in engineering
bad the armoury
worse
which one of you is reed
im lieutenant reed
i assumed id find you in the armoury not relaxing here what is that
its coffee and just for the record i havent left the armoury for so much as a bathroom break in nearly twelve hours and you are
lieutenant talas of the imperial warship kumari
this is commander tucker our chief engineer
pleasure
ive been ordered to assist you
indeed well ill see if i can find something for you to do
i have duties of my own the sooner your ship is repaired the sooner i can get back to them
well ill let you two get acquainted
i wasnt sure wed find you alive under the circumstances id say we have something to celebrate
i appreciate the gesture but we have a lot of repairs to make
and your crews doing a fine job of making them have a drink with me youve earned a brief respite andorian ale you seemed to enjoy it the last time we met i took the liberty of bringing a few extra bottles
thanks
to a swift victory
so how did you get picked for this assignment
i volunteered it made sense ive had the greatest amount of contact with pink with humans and the last time we met you helped my people avert a war i dont like unpaid debts
we keep doing each other favours
isnt that how alliances are born
i havent seen you in a while as long as youre here maybe you can give me a hand touch this onto the phase regulator there while i check the polarity i thought you might be avoiding me
three neuropressure sessions a week is hardly avoiding you the captain asked for an update on your repairs
three of the injectors are burnt out the restrictor coils are completely fried
how long until we have warp
i would say at least two days but the blue guys really know their stuff should be up and running in about twelve hours is there a problem
no keep me informed of your progress
hand me the microspanner please
ive brought some equipment that should align those relays much more precisely
the spanner will do the job nicely if you wouldnt mind
is there anything else i can get you some coffee perhaps
thatd be lovely
since you clearly dont need my help ill return to my ship thank you for the hospitality
give my regards to commander shran
for what its worth lieutenant im not here to steal your secrets it would hardly be worth the effort
i beg your pardon
last time i saw weapons like these was during my early tactical training
im sorry i wasted your time on our primitive systems
not at all i found it nostalgic just be careful when you reconnect that to your power grid you didnt reset the eps synchroniser you may singe your eyebrows when you bring it back online
lieutenant talas i apologise if ive been rude why dont i get us both a cup of coffee and we can align these relays together
two hundred million kilometres
close enough travis we dont want to give ourselves away
aye sir
its a gtype star system six planets with over a hundred moons
any biosigns
theres a great deal of debris in the system i cant tell from this range
our sensors are more sophisticated than yours we should be able to scan the system without betraying our presence if i may  this is commander shran
go ahead
transfer our long range sensor data to enterprise
yes commander
its coming in
four vessels all xindi
many of the moons show evidence of extensive weapons bombardment
why attack an uninhabited system
i dont think they attacked anyone its bikini atoll
what
when my species was developing primitive nuclear weapons they needed places to test them one was a remote island called bikini atoll
so you believe this is some kind of proving ground
its possible if they are getting ready to test their weapon were running out of time
i wouldnt recommend a frontal assault your weapons are damaged critical systems are down all over your ship and your outnumbered four to one
i thought it was four to two
even our combined forces dont stand a chance against that kind of firepower im not ready to risk my ship when we dont even know if the xindi weapon is here
i agree we need to get a closer look
what do you propose we do fly up to them and ask them what theyre doing
ensign
commander
ill take him from here
mister tucker how are your repairs coming along
pretty well thanks to your people but i was wondering if i could ask a favour im told your antimatter injectors use variable compression nozzles
told by whom thats rather sensitive information
i dont want to get anyone in trouble but one of those injectors would work wonders for our engines
i imagine it would i dont know commander thats a sophisticated piece of technology
i thought we were allies here
that remains to be seen you have my condolences over the attack on your world
thanks
i understand your sister was killed captain archer told me
well lots of people lost family
no great victory comes without sacrifice the dispute between my people and the vulcans hasnt been bloodless border skirmishes were common a few decades ago theyd violate our territory wed retaliate i was still in school when my older brother joined the imperial guard he was assigned to a forward surveillance unit i can understand why you seek vengeance against these xindi
id love to get my hands on whoever ordered that attack but thats not why were here
you have no desire to make these people pay for the death of your sister
i just want to make sure they dont get the chance to finish what they started
so any help you can give us
ill have that antimatter injector delivered to you
i appreciate it
degra whats the delay
stand by
we have been standing by for nearly an hour
were confirming final
power readings i wouldnt want you to be disappointed with the results deploy the weapon
initiate firing protocols
what is it
a ship just entered the system
what kind of ship
we cant identify it abort the test return the weapon to the launch platform
degra report
stand by
activate all defence systems contact the other vessels and have them intercept that ship
degra
were securing the weapon
ill resume contact when i can
were receiving a transmission from the ship
allow me to introduce myself my name is shran
of the andorian mining consortium
youve entered restricted space leave immediately
restricted i had no idea we dont want to cause any trouble were looking for a rare element
archerite we picked up some promising readings coming from your system
i dont care what youre looking for turn your ship around and leave
of course of course but you dont mind if we finish our scans archerite is
extremely valuable to us even a few kilos will pay our expenses for the next ten cycles
theyre scanning our ships
were not trying to violate your privacy
our sensors are omnidirectional theres nothing to be concerned about
deactivate your scans and leave or well destroy you
theres no need for threats well leave but if this system does contain archerite you just missed out your opportunity to collect a generous percentage
stop the scan take us out of the system but not too quickly the andorian mining consortium runs from no one
its emitting high levels of radiation
it could be anything power generator of some kind fusion reactor
it has the same quantum signature as the weapon that attacked earth
whats the status of our repairs
impulse and warp engines are nominal hull platings at eighty two percent
weapons
mister reed reports the anomaly caused more damage that he originally estimated
how long
he isnt certain perhaps two days
if they are here to test that thing we may not have two days
why the urgency this cant be the final version of the weapon tpols analysis shows it isnt powerful enough to destroy an entire planet let them run their tests why destroy this prototype when we can see it in use and gauge its destructive power
i dont intend to destroy it if we could get our hands on this weapon starfleet might be able to figure out a defence were going to take it
the phase couplers are charging
all we have left is to reset the emitters
whats the frequency
ill do it
you dont trust me
no offence but when it comes to our weapons frequencies i wouldnt trust my own mother
is your mother considered a security risk
its just an expression
an odd one my mothers security clearance is higher than mine
really
she commanded an imperial infantry unit
you come from a military family
four generations
three on my fathers side
he must be disappointed in you
what
betraying your family tradition by serving on a ship of exploration
actually we havent done much exploring for quite a while but since you ask he wasnt very pleased the royal navy was his life
perhaps hed feel differently if he saw you now fighting for the survival of your race
im sure he would right all done ill power it up and well see where we stand
report
theyve launched the prototype
can we get a closer look
this is shran
yes commander
transfer our sensor telemetry to enterprise
are these the satisfying results you promised
you said the moon would be destroyed
the device was building to an overload we were forced to shut it down
why
what happened
i need
time to analyse the data
time we have given you more than enough time we were promised a weapon to destroy the humans in one stroke not hack away at them bit by bit
hes right degra our patience is wearing thin
that moon was nearly split in two clearly progress has been made
not enough every failure puts us at risk
degra
can the problem be rectified
once ive recovered the device ill have more information
we hope so
the output was much greater than the probe that attacked earth but still i dont believe the device reached its maximum yield we detected power fluctuations it appears it was building toward an overload
are you saying this was a failure
a spectacular one but yes
gralik an arboreal xindi that we met at a facility that manufactured one of the components for the weapon he promised to help us looks like he kept his word
why havent they retrieved it
its still emitting high levels of radiation
how long until its safe enough to get close
six hours at least
weve got to get to it before they do what if we shield the launch bay evacuate all the adjacent compartments could we bring it aboard any sooner
our shielding wouldnt be sufficient to protect the crew
use my ship our forcefield will contain the radiation well secure the device in our cargo bay until its safe to transfer to enterprise
thats a generous offer but what are we supposed to do cheer you on
its four against two remember this would be a joint venture
archer to lieutenant reed
reed here sir
whats the status on weapons
torpedoes are back online and thanks to lieutenant talas we should have phase cannons within the hour
were going to need them archer out
i wish we had more time youre only going to get ninety four percent efficiency from the phase cannons
ive never gotten them above ninety three if you ever decide to leave the imperial guard starfleet could certainly use you
and if you get tired of exploring youd do well in the imperial guard
i appreciate your offer shran we accept
ill return to my ship
im going with you i plan to be there when you bring the weapon aboard
that wont be necessary well keep you informed
thats not good enough if something goes wrong
kumari is a warship with a battletested crew theyre capable of performing their duties without you looking over their shoulders
what happened to this being a joint venture
well render whatever assistance we can but my crew wont take orders from you
theyre going to have to
the imperial guard doesnt serve at your leisure pinkskin
this is my mission
and youd pass up your best chance for success over a matter of pride
this isnt about pride the xindi killed seven million humans not andorians i wont put the fate of my people in the hands of the imperial guard now we could use your help but if youre not happy with me calling the shots then well go it alone
ive seen the scans you transmitted commander impressive
archers science officer believes the weapon is unstable it nearly overloaded
the vulcan
i have no reason to doubt her assessment she seems competent
well review her data proceed as planned
general the humans may yet become valuable allies
if your mission is successful we wont need an alliance with them or anyone
why squander the opportunity is this mission worth making enemies of them
its not up to you to determine the value of this mission commander i trust your regard for this pinkskin wont cause you to forget that
what are you doing why are you accessing the sensors they werent damaged
not by the anomaly with all the bypasses weve been running we obviously could have created some additional problems
youre just being thorough
you wouldnt want to be in a battle with the xindi and suddenly find yourself flying blind
so anything we need to worry about
your lateral array was out of alignment i corrected it all other systems are functioning properly id take this ship into combat myself
even with our primitive weapons
its not the weapon its the soldier who wields it
what is it
a ship
the andorians
no biosigns are human
send the escort ships to intercept we have to keep them away from the weapon
two xindi ships approaching
tactical alert evasive manoeuvres ensign
aye
hail the captain
the two reptilian ships are moving towards us the other vessels are holding position
try to keep them busy
acknowledged
i await your orders
lets go get it
charge weapons set a course
another vessel its the andorian ship theyre heading for the weapon
theyre working together get our ships back here now
hull platings holding
return fire target their engines
theyre breaking off
theyre heading back into the system
pursuit course ensign continue firing all weapons
we have it
take us out of the system maximum speed  are they following
no the human vessel disabled main propulsion on both ships
what about enterprise
theyve gone to warp no apparent damage
contact tpol have her meet us at the rendezvous point is there a problem
inform the imperial guard we have the weapon set a course for andoria maximum warp
what are you doing
im afraid we wont be taking orders from you any longer
now i see why you generously offered to let us use your ship you son of a bitch
i was ordered to retrieve the weapon by whatever means necessary
im starting to think the vulcans may be right about you
the vulcans are the reason were doing this
what are you talking about
for two hundred years all thats kept them from invading andoria is the threat of massive retaliation with a weapon of this magnitude at our disposal they wouldnt dare attack us
youre putting earth at risk because of a border dispute with the vulcans
we disrupted the xindi test took their weapon we may have helped save your world
i guess im not familiar with the andorian concept of help
i dont need to justify my actions to you pinkskin i swore an oath to the imperial guard my loyalty lies with them
my crew wont let you take the weapon without a fight
your ship isnt fast enough to catch us
youll have to slow down to pass back through the anomaly field
i anticipated that when talas was working on enterprise she disrupted the main sensor array they may be able to catch up to us but theyll have no way to find us
you like to talk about repaying debts ive owed you that for a long time
take the captain to an escape pod dont worry ill alert enterprise where to find you
we disabled main power on both reptilian ships the other vessels arent pursing us
what about our sensors
back online you were right sir if i hadnt been watching that andorian officer it might have taken weeks to find where shed sabotaged the array
their ship
its approaching the anomaly field
theyve reduced speed well intercept them in fourteen minutes
weve begun examining the weapon
excellent work ill see that you receive a commendation
with respect general id prefer you didnt
transmit your analysis as soon as possible
commander shran
what is it
enterprise is approaching
where are they
eighty thousand kilometres theyre hailing us
captain archer glad to see you made it back safely how did you find us
you dont think id let your people work on my ship without appropriate supervision give us the weapon
i respect your perseverance but you dont actually think youll be able to take it from us
no i think youre going to give it to us willingly
i should have warned you dont drink too much of that andorian ale in one sitting
you tossed me overboard before i had a chance to thank you for letting us access your sensor telemetry when the xindi tested the weapon we were able to intercept their activation codes give it to us or well detonate it in your cargo bay
youll lose your prize
id rather do that than let you take it back to andoria
why were not your enemy
i cant take the chance that youd use it against the vulcans
what have the vulcans done to deserve your loyalty
you said you came to help us shran you can still make good on your offer
im sorry pinkskin
youre not giving me any choice
i dont believe you take us into the anomaly field
tpol
shran to cargo hold three whats your status
the firing matrix has activated i believe the device is arming itself
shut it down
were trying commander
id get rid of it while you still can
report
they have less than thirty seconds
shran
twenty seconds
clear the hold prepare to open the bay doors
six seconds
lets get moving
already on it sir
no damage sir
the andorians
they were much closer than we were their hulls intact but theres significant damage to their engines and power systems
open a channel to shran ask him if he requires our assistance
you have something
just before we went to warp we received a transmission from the andorian ship
it wasnt on one of their normal comm frequencies it was encrypted to look like subspace interference
lets see it
apparently they had time to take some detailed scans while it was aboard their ship
judging by the clandestine nature of the transmission id guess that whoever sent this didnt want to be discovered
get it to starfleet command right away
why dont you and trip join me for dinner tonight i have some andorian ale you might like to try
who are you
theyre targeting our engines
what do you want with me
youre the weapons expert see if you can get those shields back online if we dont raise the shields the only thats going to be left of this ship is a cloud of vapour
insectoids
these could be shield emitters theyre not going to last for long
open a channel to those ships
what
theyre xindi ill order them to hold their fire
its been a long time since any xindi took orders from you were carrying five hundred litres of warp plasma in the starboard tanks well have to vent it turn these down on my mark theyre going to destroy us now
what happened
the plasma got into their intake manifolds their engines are overheating
i want to know who you are why youve abducted me
you really dont remember i was afraid this might happen its me archer
what species are you
youve been through a lot in the last two days just let me figure out
what species
im human
youre from the earth vessel
degra you have to listen to me im not your enemy anymore youve spent the last two days in an interrogation chamber whatever the insectoids did to you in there must have affected your memory my name is jonathan archer the two of us just escaped from an insectoid prison colony
prison
weve shared a cell for almost three years
thats not possible
roll up your sleeves
the conflict between our people is over we both lost i promise ill explain everything right now we have to get out of here before our friends out there repair their engines
what are you doing
theres a system about a week from here its isolated i doubt theyll look for us there
you expect me to believe my own people would hold me prisoner you think thats amusing
its been a while since you referred to those overgrown grasshoppers as your own people
why dont i remember you
probably because of the bloodworms
bloodworms
theyre used during interrogations their secretions act as a truth serum makes the prisoners more cooperative but theres a side effect sometimes they can suppress memories the same thing happened when they questioned me i forgot everything that happened since flight school itll start to come back to you give it a few days
you claim that ive been a prisoner for three years
three years
if thats true why would they question me now
they wanted information about the weapon
what kind of information
this is going to take some time whats the last thing you remember
i was on my vessel approaching the planet in the calindra system
the weapons test it failed because your prototype was sabotaged
how would you know that
because im responsible for it your kemocite shipment was tampered with
gralik
he wasnt too happy when i told him what you were planning to do with his kemocite
hell be executed for this
he was in the end it didnt make much of a difference we didnt stop your programme we only slowed it down a few weeks later the weapon was launched it destroyed my planet
we were successful
i dont know if youd call it a success after earth was destroyed the old xindi rivalries surfaced again the insectoids started attacking other xindi colonies they killed thousands of your people
the reptilians and aquatics would never allow that
there wasnt a lot they could do while you were busy constructing the weapon the insectoids were secretly building hundreds of new ships they used earth as a diversion their real goal was to dominate the other xindi species are you all right
its just a bloodworm itll work its was out
can you remove it
hold still
i think you need this more than i do suit yourself
i dont understand how a xindi and a human could put aside their differences so quickly
trust me it didnt happen overnight
you gave me this the first day we were locked up together the guards thought it would be entertaining to put us in the same cell they even placed wagers on who would survive the longest i was in pretty bad shape at the time so you were the oddson favourite your people killed everyone i ever cared about i was going to make sure you never walked out of that cell for weeks we tried to kill each other i was lying in the infirmary when i finally asked myself what was the point my world was gone but so was yours so i made a proposal the two of us would work together to get out of that place took us longer than either one of us thought but here we are
i dont recognise this type of ship
its a malosian cargo shuttle
malosian
theyre traders they bring supplies to the prison a few times a month no weapons but shes sturdy enough to get us where were going
perhaps we should set a course to your vessel is it still in the expanse
not exactly when we were getting close to finding your weapon the insectoids sent their ships after us they boarded enterprise and took me prisoner then they planted spatial charges around our warp reactor my crew was still aboard when they detonated them
the insectoids were always the aggressive species but i never thought them capable of this they destroyed everything the council worked for
the council
it was formed when our planet was destroyed it was created to find a new home world for all xindi after years of searching we found a few suitable locations but as usual couldnt agree on a final choice our plan for reunification was put aside when we learned of the threat from earth i was ordered to begin designing the weapon i devoted years to it i made so many sacrifices so did my wife do i know what happened to my family
you told me youd heard from naara before you were sent to prison she and the children were safe we have a ship now we can look for them
they were on a colony near a red giant
theres nothing in range do you remember the coordinates
i doubt if theres anything left it would have been one of the first colonies to be attacked
there may have been survivors
its too dangerous patrol ships are still looking for us we should find a refuge in case
reactor coolant the conduit must have ruptured in the attack take it
what about you
youre the one with a family you want to see them again try to seal the rupture ill see if i can close off the coolant tanks
tpol
he should remain unconscious for at least two hours
the son of a bitch designed the weapon
keep an eye on him trip
what have we got
there are seven red giants in this region but theyre spread over approximately forty light years
can we scan them for a weapons facility
not at this distance
this red giant might be a red herring he only told you his family was living near one of these stars we dont know that the weapon is there
degras a senior official we know hes designing the weapon theres a chance hed keep his family close by
for a moment i thought he was going to give you the coordinates
too bad he didnt go for the andorian ale that wouldve loosened him up
you appear to have gained his trust perhaps you should try a more direct approach
what do you mean
ask him where the weapon is being constructed
its too risky if he suspects something well wind up right back where we started hell tell me i just need a little more time
im picking up a ship at the edge of the system
its xindi
why didnt we see it before
it may have been travelling through one of the subspace vortices that they use its hull signature matches the xindi ships that were here two days ago
captain im reading three biosigns on board
have they seen us yet
i dont believe so
set course for the inner moon stand by to deploy the sensor drones
whats that
weapons fire
from where
theres a ship closing its the human vessel
you said there was no one in the system
they must have been hiding in the debris
contact the council
theyve disabled our subspace transceiver
theyre making a run for it
see what you can do about their engines
theyre not going anywhere sir
hail them
stand down and prepare to be boarded
thalen
anything
they were attempting to erase the computer core when we boarded the ship theres very little data left
what about navigational logs
theyve been deleted
i may have something here sir i think these are fragments from a personal file there are parts of a letter from someone named degra
does it mention the weapon
no theres a reference to a planet he visited recently azati prime
let me know what else you find
id love to spend an afternoon taking this engine apart
not your typical nacelle configuration
look how everythings tied in through their main deflector
learn everything you can
i want to know where youre building the weapon
i dont know what youre talking about
the hell you dont your name is degra i was at the xindi colony when you picked up your shipment of kemocite your people are planning another attack im not going to let that happen
by capturing us youve accomplished nothing
wheres the weapon
archer to the bridge report
theres a surge in the plasma network
whats causing it
radiation from the debris field its starting to affect our systems
sir i recommend putting a safe distance between us and the test site
all right take the ship out of the field but keep us close by
understood
if you wont tell me what i need to know perhaps one of your men will
when my superiors learn were missing theyll find your ship and destroy it
i could make a truth serum but it could take weeks to synthesise the correct formula ive been studying xindi neurophysiology it may be possible to erase his most recent memory engrams that way degra will never know that he came aboard or that he met any of us
but this is a xindi reptilian would it work on a primate
their neural pathways are virtually identical ill need to perform a few tests but i dont expect it will be a problem
how selective could this memory wipe be
ive built flight simulators for starfleet training this wouldnt be that different
its not simply a matter of constructing a shuttle it has to be designed what species built it what language would the control interface use
hoshi can help with that
ive recovered a letter degra wrote to his wife a few months ago her names naara they have two children
it may be necessary to communicate with you while youre inside the simulator
the macos use subdermal transceivers
theyre relatively easy to implant
lets get started
tpol i could use your help with some of the details
details
if he buys into this degras going to want to know everything thats happened in the last three years i cant make up the whole story on the spot
nice work
thank you dermal art used to be very common on denobula fortunately my parents insisted i study it ive also stimulated his hair follicles
im not sure about the grey this is only supposed to be three years from now
ah but youre forgetting about the stress of imprisonment and torture it could very well have an effect on hair pigmentation
youre sure these are safe
oh yes ive treated patients with regulan bloodworms for years there should be no sideeffects aside from a thoroughly cleansed lymphatic system please try not to injure it theyre difficult to replace
ill do my best
what is it
spatial anomalies were passing through a field of them hold on
tpol to cargo bay two
increase hydraulics to level six
is the hull lined with trellium
obviously not
increase to level seven
on my mark initiate a sharp jolt to starboard
how sharp
do you want it
sharp
you heard the lady
let the captain know
this is going to be a rough one sir
were losing structural integrity im taking us out of warp well never make it through this field in one piece
can we go around
we dont have enough fuel we should send a distress call one of your ships might be close enough to hear it
what if the insectoids pick it up
we dont have a lot of choices
theres a comm channel used by highranking primate officials i doubt the insectoids know it
whats the frequency
it would be easier for me to enter it directly
ensign
ive got it
stand by to respond
bridge to command centre
go ahead
im picking up a distortion in subspace i believe its a xindi ship
how long until they arrive
about six hours
their sensors are pretty sophisticated they might see us long before then
lieutenant take us back into the debris field
the radiation could overload our systems again
im aware of the risks carry out my orders
acknowledged
one of the inmates told me all about maarek three he used it as a staging area when he was smuggling dilithium
what did he say it was like
beautiful with beaches that go on for thousands of kilometres first thing im going to do is find a cold lake and take the longest bath of my life
it sounded a lot like earth the way he described it
the captains certainly drinking a lot
the doctor gave him an antiintoxicant
this colony of yours you never told me about it
it was bleak desolate
the planet was barely habitable
whyd you live there
it wasnt by choice naara was desperate to leave she didnt think a military habitat was the right environment for the children do you have a family captain
its been a long time since anyone called me captain its jonathan remember i never really had an opportunity to start one i was away from home a lot
you should make the time ive learned that our work in the end means very little our real legacy is the children i would do anything to protect mine after i was told of the threat from humanity i left my theoretical studies and agreed to design the prototype weapon when it arrived in your star system i watched the incoming telemetry with the other members of the council seven million lives were extinguished in front of my eyes i asked myself how many of those were children i suppose ive told you this before
actually you havent
three years my children may not even recognise me after so much
were being hailed whoever it is they must be pretty far away ill try to clear it up
transmission this is thalen responding to your distress call please acknowledge
its one of my colleagues
thalen can you hear me its degra
degra its good to hear your voice id heard from my sources
that youd been captured by the insectoids there were reports that you had been executed
they havent killed me yet i need your help my friend and i
have escaped from an insectoid prison their patrols are looking for us
im losing your signal please repeat
better make it fast
thalen where are you
im on azati prime its safe here
is my family still there are they safe thalen
naara is here and the children ill tell them to expect you
at least you know theyre all right
there were more than a thousand primates and arboreals at that colony i dont understand why it wasnt destroyed
we should still change course do you know the coordinates whats wrong
you must forgive me to me its been only a day since we were enemies giving you the coordinates to a classified installation is difficult
be my guest
theyre coming in one one two seven point four by four zero five two by three nine zero one point one
a red giant open a comm line to the captain
you encrypted the navigation controls
yes
captain the coordinates match the location of one of the red giants
do you mind if i ask how long it will take to get there
not long
approximately three weeks at maximum warp
a considerable detour if the weapon isnt there
what will your people think when you show up with me humans probably arent their favourite species
ill tell them everything you did to help me im a senior official there wont be any problems
i appreciate that
its a diverse community far more pleasant than most military
travis
the port hydraulics are acting up
shut them down
theyre not responding
tpol to cargo bay two report
the radiation from the debris is
overloading the hydraulic system
can you stabilise the simulator
im working on it
more anomalies
im not sure
captain were having some problems stand by tpol to the bridge take us out of the debris field
understood
bridge to the command centre were clear of the debris field
acknowledged
what was the problem
subspace turbulence
really im curious jonathan if weve been friends for as long as you say i must have told you the names of my children
you still dont believe me do you
theres something in his hand
im sure i would have told you
magnify
its been years since youve said anything
captain he has a weapon
i just need you to tell me
what their names are
were coming in
this isnt necessary
piral and jaina
piral and jaina
which one is older
its not in here sir
youll never find the weapon
take him to the brig
we were told humans were ruthless but i didnt know you were also skilled at deception
when did you realise
i had my suspicions from the beginning but it was the comm signal from my colleague on azati prime that confirmed them
we know your ship has been there recently
theres an insectoid deuterium facility on azati prime thats the last place my people would have gone to hide from them if it werent for that one mistake your plan might have succeeded
you gave us the coordinates of a red giant
i gave you what you thought you wanted
i guess ill just have to wipe your memory clean again go back into the simulator and start this whole thing over
i doubt theres time for that we both know my people are searching for me
i think you didnt figure it out until after the malfunction id be willing to bet those coordinates are real
then i suggest you proceed there at maximum warp
why would he encrypt the coordinates if they werent accurate
perhaps he thought it would make them appear more convincing
hes got to be lying sir something must have happened during the radiation surge that tipped him off
we cant afford to lose three weeks if the weapon isnt there have you learned anything more about how they open the subspace vortices
they use some kind of phase deflector pulses once theyre in their ships can travel half a dozen light years in a couple of minutes
i want to see all the data youve collected
archer to the bridge
were ready
tactical alert engage
open it
sir
you two come with me i said move
well fracture the hull if this goes on any longer
hull breaches on decks d and e
emergency bulkheads youre the engineer
yes
youre going to help us we adapted your technology used our main deflector to open a subspace vortex
thats impossible
the vortex is starting to collapse i need you to stabilise it
if you dont do what he says this ship will break apart lieutenant
tell him to do what hes told
do nothing to help them
the pylons are buckling
engineering were losing hull integrity
trip
it wasnt me captain
ill be damned travis inverted the warp field it dropped us back into normal space
tpol to captain archer
go ahead
please report to the bridge
take him back to the brig
report
weve reached the coordinates ensign magnify
im picking up several xindi vessels im also reading significant quantities of kemocite
whats our status
minimal damage the hull platings coming back online
arm all weapons lay in a course for those kemocite signatures full impulse get him out of here
youll never get close to the weapon our defence perimeter will destroy you
show him
thanks for your help take him to sickbay
i think you overdid the turbulence just a little ensign
ill try to do better next time sir
hows it coming
weve made it appear as if a plasma conduit ruptured rendering them unconscious
im injecting them with trace amounts of the plasma it wont be harmful
this accident wont explain how their computer core was deleted
as long as they dont know we were here we can leave them with a mystery  go ahead
the xindi vessels less than an hour away sir
malcolm can be a tough man to get to know ill grant you that he likes to keep to himself this feel okay
but you spend enough time around him you come to realise theres no one youd rather have watching your back
i thought you said you werent ticklish
i didnt used to be
maybe im doing this wrong
maybe we should try another position
posture sure take a seat
i just get the feeling whenever lieutenant reed looks at one of us he sees the enemy
i dont think malcolm thinks of macos as the enemy competition maybe relax
this is one of the first pressure points tpol worked on helped me get through many a night
feels great too bad this cant be a part of our training routine
you should bring it up with hayes
his training regimen hasnt changed since i joined up major hayes likes consistency
so does malcolm he told me that while he was in starfleet training he ate the exact same three meals every day for a year
theyre definitely cut from the same cloth
maybe thats why they get along so well  hows it feeling
still great
there
feel like ive just had twelve hours sleep
well i guess i did it right
well
well
that was unexpected
nothing wrong with unexpected
no with a little warning
consider that a little warning for next time
come in
you wanted to see me sir
i had a conversation with major hayes this morning he wants to put your security team and all the senior officers through a series of training drills
we run drills twice a week senior officers are free to attend
these would be different theyd be conducted by major hayes and the macos
sir
were heading into a hostile situation we dont know what were going to face when we get there
my people are ready sir
the macos tactics and technology are two three years beyond starfleets why not let them pass on some of that expertise you dont agree
the macos expertise comes from simulated combat all conducted on earth on the other hand weve fought numerous alien species on many different worlds if anything we should be giving the macos the benefit of our experience
hayes and his men have gone up against a few aliens on this mission including the xindi theyve handled themselves pretty well id like you to coordinate the training sessions with the major
aye sir
ah i appreciate your stopping by so quickly
what did you want to ask me
are you acquainted with corporal amanda cole
shes one of the macos
she was in this morning with a mild headache says shes been experiencing it for a week now every test i ran came back negative frankly i was mystified until she mentioned she was receiving vulcan neuropressure from commander tucker
you believe its causing her headaches
well i wanted to ask you neuropressures a highly specialised discipline commander tuckers only be receiving it for a couple of months i thought it was possible that he might have misapplied one of its techniques
its possible
well ive already spoken to corporal cole about using caution but i was wondering if you might have a word with commander tucker perhaps during your next session with him
gladly
everything all right
yes if theres nothing else
oh there is one other thing if you find time perhaps you could schedule a neuropressure session with corporal cole maybe undo some of commander tuckers work
okay tuesday wednesday friday how does oh eight hundred sound
i prefer to train in the evenings
any reason
you get a better workout muscles are looser reaction times quicker
how about tuesdays and fridays in the morning wednesdays in the evening
how about tuesdays and fridays in the evenings and wednesday in the morning
youre not making this very easy
im not trying to make it difficult
with all due respect i think thats exactly what youre trying to do
with all due respect is that what you call circumventing my authority
i wasnt aware id done that
and what did you think you were doing when you went to the captain with this proposal
if id come to you first youd have turned me down flat
youre probably right but the decision was mine to make
i didnt mean to deprive you of the opportunity
i think thats exactly what you meant to do
whatever you might think sir my only concern is the successful outcome of this mission
as is mine tuesdays and fridays in the evenings
whats the problem
i cant understand it captain its like the stars keep shifting positions
what do you mean
there they just did it again
maybe its one of the navigational sensors
ive already run two diagnostics i cant find anything wrong
i think i have the cause an unusually strong gravimetric disturbance approximately three light years away
lets go take a look
it appears to be a convergence of spatial anomalies
its more than seven hundred million kilometres in diameter
captain im picking up an intermittent signal very faint
an object approximately five metres in length
lets see it
its just a few hundred metres from the edge im reading one biosign humanoid
could be an escape pod
are there any other ships in the vicinity
none the biosigns are very erratic
bring the grappler online
try again
ill see if i can compensate
travis
were losing systems all over the ship
helms not responding
there are rising levels on ammonium sulphide in the atmosphere
archer to engineering
commander tucker
the helms not responding we need full reverse
right away
im on it
helms back online
get us out of here
love to
were ready to open the hatch
hes suffering from a form of rapid cellular degeneration
do you think you can stop it
i dont know yet ive managed to revive him but hes in a fair amount of pain
im captain archer
you had no right to bring me here
we were trying to save your life
i didnt ask for your help return me to my ship
your vessel has minimal life support you wouldnt last too long if we took you back
thats none of your concern
what was that pod designed to do
im not answering any of your questions
youre dying were doing everything we can for you but
take me back to my ship
he may be going into shock
hows it coming
good sir were adjusting the nav sensors to compensate for the gravimetric waves
get us underway as soon as you can
just need a day to upload and test these corrections
learn anything
a great deal the disturbance appears to be expanding at a rate of several kilometres per second and its location is exactly equidistant to five of the spheres
do you think the spheres have something to do with creating this thing
its possible this planet was once an inhabited world it was engulfed some time ago i couldnt find any signs of life
maybe the alien we picked up is the last survivor
a possibility
i want you and trip to take a look at the pod if we cant revive the alien it may be our best source of information
we incorporate elements from numerous disciplines its extremely effective in hand to hand situations what id like to do now is break up into sparring pairs run through some of the moves you just saw lets get started
try the combination nice cross
excellent effective combination
you were looking at his hands when you should have been watching his eyes
good match
all right why dont we take five minutes
thats all for today
we still have the shoulder throws to cover
session is over
okay for next time work on your forearm blocks and the elbow strikes
dismissed
what the hell was that
that was a sparring demonstration
it was way out of line that last throw was completely unnecessary
he was on his feet that made him fair game
fair game
its just a little blood sir no one got hurt
these are training sessions major if your men cant understand that then im going to put a stop to this right now is that clear
perfectly
jolly good
i think its a transmitter i just cant pinpoint the frequency
doctor phlox has asked me to speak with you
what about
corporal coles been experiencing headaches the doctor believes they might be caused by your neuropressure sessions
she never said anything about headaches
perhaps she didnt want to worry you
why would neuropressure be the cause
it shouldnt be performed by novices if misapplied you could cause nerve damage
ive performed it on you plenty of times
under my supervision
i see you want to supervise me and corporal cole
i think it would simply be best if you ended the sessions these electrodes were collecting biometric data from the occupant
amanda wont be too happy about ending the sessions
im sure she wont
what do you mean by that
ive noticed that you and corporal cole have become somewhat friendly
friendly
last week you were eating together in the mess hall and in the training session yesterday she touched your behind
youve been keeping a pretty close eye on us
youre hard to miss
look amanda and i just share a lot of interests thats all we both come from florida
theres no reason to justify your behaviour i was simply suggesting you might use some discretion
discretion
its not appropriate for a senior officer to fraternise with a subordinate
shes not starfleet theres nothing inappropriate about it whats wrong
we need to get this data to the captain immediately
theres no mistake the pods hull contains the exact combination of alloys we found on the surface of the spheres
you remember the triannon creation myth
they believed the spheres were created by divine beings who will one day return to the chosen realm
and that the spheres were reshaping the expanse into a paradise for the faithful
perhaps triannon mythology has a basis in fact it appears the pod was designed to transmit data regarding the aliens physiological status i believe he was inserted into the disturbance so someone could monitor his exposure to the environment
a canary on earth miners used to take canaries into the tunnels with them if the canary didnt die the miners knew the air would be safe to breathe and they could proceed
his condition has worsened hes literally disintegrating and there doesnt seem to be any way to stop it
i want to talk to him again
i dont even know if i can revive him
find a way
captain this man is dying a painful death to keep him conscious is unethical
until i get the answers i need were going to have to bend a few ethics
very well ill do what i can
notify me when hes conscious
corporal come in
thank you maam i appreciate your doing this
please sit down remove your jacket i assume commander tucker briefed you on the proper breathing technique
he did
begin with a deep breath good doctor phlox did caution you against any further neuropressure from commander tucker
i got the lecture
you and commander tucker appear to enjoy each others company
we do have a lot in common did he tell you we grew up less than fifty kilometres from each other
he didnt mention it
our high schools were rivals we went to the same movie theatres what are the odds
extremely low
unfortunately neither of our home towns exists any more they were both destroyed in the attack
did you lose any relatives
my family moved up north a few years ago i was lucky
commander tucker was greatly affected by his sisters death
he talks about her a lot
youre quite fond of him
whats not to like hes a gentleman hes great to be around and he has very nice arms ow
i apologise ill try not to press so hard
we developed this specialised training system at jupiter station a few months ago the goal is to hit as many targets as you can in ten seconds lieutenant if youre up for it fall back start him off at level two
four targets in ten seconds not bad for a first go but you might schedule a little extra practice time kick it up to level four
nine hits thats a midrange score corporal cole here has the record fourteen hits at level four
i was having a lucky day
okay lets do some shooting well start at level two and work our way up whod like to go next
that target practice was something sure looked a easier than it was
you dont say
oh come on your score got a lot better as the session went on
i started picturing hayes head in place of the target
you two really ought to declare a truce
oh no this is a fight to the death
i guess if i were in your shoes id be just as upset
hes determined to take over the security of this ship you know
you really believe that
everything he does points to the fact
well it could also be that he wants everyone to be as prepared as possible you have to admit the extra training isnt such a bad idea
just drop it
okay
so why dont you tell me about you and miss cole
were friends is everyone on this ship watching us
youre pretty hard to miss
thats what tpol said
is it true shes giving amanda neuropressure now
so
i heard it was damage control from your tender touch
tpols just smoothing out some of the rough spots thats all
and why were you giving amanda cole neuropressure anyway
whats it to you
well from what im told its a pretty intimate procedure for just friends
i do it with tpol are you implying theres something going on there as well
thats the rumour
look for the last time theres nothing going on with any of us between any of us
right youre all just friends
thats right
i guess this vulcan neuropressure isnt that intimate after all
exactly
in that case ive got a nasty little pain just
just drop it
we know you were sent here as some kind of test subject the region of space where we found you what is it
his pain medications wearing off
hold off a second
captain
i was sent against my will i am not from your part of space i come from a transdimensional realm
keep going
i dont know why i was sent here
i find that hard to believe
its the truth i was a prisoner because of my transgressions ive spent my entire adult life inside a cell one day the guards offered me freedom if i would participate in an experiment i agreed thats all i remember before i woke up here
we found you drifting in a pod hooked up to banks of monitoring equipment youre telling me you have no idea why
the experiment was important to them they wouldnt abandon me take me back
thats impossible
if you dont ill die please  whats happening to me whats happening to me
between all this training and the extra shifts in engineering ive been looking forward to this all day
sit up
you arent saying much tonight dont tell me youre still upset about me and amanda
im not upset
it sure sounds like it
youre mistaken
why would a few neuropressure sessions between me and a maco be such a big deal unless
unless what
unless youre a little jealous
i dont experience jealousy
youre doing a pretty fair imitation of it
i am not in any way jealous of you and corporal cole
you know your voice is tensing up its a dead giveaway
i didnt know you were an expert in vocal inflections
i dont need to be an expert to read you come on admit it youre a little jealous
youre implying that im attracted to you
that kind of goes along with the assumption doesnt it
i think youre mistaken about whos attracted to whom
are you saying im attracted to you
i dont need to say it you already have
i dont remember that conversation
it wasnt you it was your clone sim told me
sim
he said he had feelings for me
he told you that
standing right there
what the hell was he doing in your room
your voice is tensing up
oh now youre the vocal expert
i dont need to be an expert to read you
i cant believe this im jealous of myself
youre jealous
no absolutely not okay maybe maybe i am a little
which would mean youre attracted to me it goes with the assumption
what just happened here did we are we
youre not like the others on this ship
theyre from a different world than i am
what are they called your two worlds
mine is called denobula my shipmates are from earth
am i going to die
im doing everything i can
im grateful to you for trying doctor
try to rest
are you leaving so soon
i dont want to distract you
its no distraction in fact i could use a sparring partner if youre up for it
always good forearm block nice backfist show me the combination
faster on that combination youre improving
you want to keep that left up thats it stay loose excellent
youre improving
you see you were looking at my hands when you should have been looking at my eyes
okay lieutenant
major
tell me something
what
why wont you let me do my job
because youre here to enhance the combat capacity of this crew not take over security
is that what this is all about you think i want to replace you
you just cant stand taking orders from me can you
i have no problems taking orders from you
after lunar survival training i could handle just about anything good sparring with you
hayes
as you were
what was that
its a little klingon move i picked up
tactical alert senior officers to their posts
hes disrupting systems as he goes we can use that to track him  that was the secondary relay coupling
hes on b deck
between the a1 and a3 bulkheads
were coming up on access tube seventeen baker
hes moving in your direction
can you be any more specific
malcolm status
our weapons had no effect on him
hes heading towards the centre of the ship
archer to engineering
tucker
lieutenant
magnetic containment is fluctuating
we need to reverse polarity on the plasma coils itll trigger a feedback pulse turn the tvalve all the way to the left
all right
lets see if you can handle this
morning
commander
coffee strong some night
eventful
i dont know who did more damage to the engine the alien or malcolm
how long before we can get underway
another day at least i guess we should talk about what happened last night
ive been briefed on the situation
well i was referring to what happened between us in your quarters i guess ill go first actually why dont you go first
i suppose i should thank you
no need to thank me
for facilitating my exploration of human sexuality
im not sure i follow
its one of the many aspects of your species which ive been meaning to explore since i left the high command
sounds like youre saying last night was some kind of experiment
i wouldnt use that term
but thats the general idea
are you getting emotional
no im not getting emotional i just dont like being compared to a lab rat
im sorry if i offended you
forget it id appreciate it if we could keep this between us in fact we probably should forget it ever happened
agreed
doesnt mean we cant keep doing the neuropressure though
doctor phlox says you have a detached retina a bruised left kidney were in a dangerous region of space were trying to stop an alien race from destroying earth we face attacks from all sides enemies everywhere we go the last thing i need is to hear that two of my senior officers have been admitted to sickbay because they suddenly regressed to the level of five year olds
captain
dont try to tell me who started it i dont know what the problem is between you two and to tell you the truth i dont care but i want it settled right now settle it thats an order
theres no problem captain
its settled sir
how are the drills going
good sir
very good sir
archer
please come to sickbay captain the alien has regained consciousness
on my way
think were dismissed
im afraid theres nothing i can do
you werent sent here against your will you know exactly what your mission was what were your people trying to do you tried to destroy my ship why answer me
when the xindi destroy earth my people will prevail
damn
porthos come back here porthos stop return heel thats it heel porthos
all right but just for a moment
thats enough you can come and see him again tomorrow
it says here that canines can be quite territorial is that why you keep returning to the captains quarters on earth a dog called scruffers travelled three thousand kilometres attempting to reunite with its human keeper i heard of a pycan space moth that drifted half a light year trying to return to its home world but i dont believe it had a name i could use a walk how about you
dear doctor lucas i apologise in responding to your last letter as you can imagine the crew and i have been quite busy
in we go i was deeply saddened to hear about your colleagues lost in the xindi attack you have my condolences its unfortunate you were forced to cut your time on denobula short but obviously youre needed on earth perhaps when our mission is successfully completed ill see you back in san francisco the expanse an extremely curious place
for example weve recently encountered a phenomenon that er  do you want one of these i doubt youd like it its a leech you know it will clean out your intestinal tract dont tell the captain
i apparently find myself in somewhat unsettling circumstances doctor lucas although they have allowed me the luxury of catching up on my correspondence
we first encountered the phenomenon responsible for this situation two days ago
its directly on our route to azati prime
why didnt sensors pick it up before now
because it wasnt there before now its similar to the phenomenon we encountered several weeks ago
a transdimensional disturbance
this region is being rapidly reconfigured as we speak
how long would it take to go around it
two weeks
another detour
perhaps not since this region was formed only recently it hasnt been completely reconfigured we should still be able to cross it safely
you said nothing from our universe could survive inside these things
doctor
thats true unless we take the appropriate precautions the reconfigured space disrupts the human neocortex but i can counteract the effects by dampening the crews neurological activity it would be like oh shutting down the main computer to protect it from an ion storm
how do you plan to shut down our neocortexes
quite simply i can place each of you in a comatose state until weve passed through the affected region
how quickly can we get across it
less than an hour at warp four
i dont want to risk going to warp in there who knows what kind of effect this disturbance will have on our warp field well be safer sticking to impulse youll have to keep us in comas for at least four days
thats still less time than it would take to go around it
can you keep us under that long
shouldnt cause any problems
commander tucker was none too keen on my plan however i was able to convince captain archer since my denobulan physiology is immune to the effects of the disturbance i volunteered to watch over the crew so far theyve been no trouble at all
while the computers controlling most of the ships systems i was given a quick tutorial just in case despite the dire circumstances i must say i relished the challenge and soon developed a newfound respect for ensign mayweather
you need to check this every two hours minimum
every two hours
if the impulse manifolds get clogged the enginesll overload that would be very bad
i imagine it would
no offence doc but under normal circumstances i wouldnt even let you in here without four years of starfleet training under your belt
these are hardly normal circumstances
listen if something happens something you cant handle i want you to wake me up
i cant do that even a few minutes of exposure would cause permanent damage
if it comes down to saving the ship look im making it easy for you okay
hows the rest of the crew doing
sleeping peacefully except for you now lie back
doctor
please captain ive told you the procedures completely safe
im sure it is but i
captain i have already had this discussion with commander tucker lieutenant reed and virtually every other officer on the ship im not comfortable being incapacitated i really should be at my post im willing to risk staying awake well you cant nor do you need to i assure you i have everything well in hand
i know doctor as captain of the ship im the one whos responsible for everyone aboard there arent many people id willingly turn that responsibility over to youre one of them
well thank you captain
i just wanted to say that before you put me under
i must say doctor lucas that i appreciated the captains vote of confidence i had in fact been feeling some trepidation over the responsibility id been handed but after two days at the helm the ship is running perfectly
hello hello  nonetheless im not ashamed to admit ill be relieved when i can wake up the crew in two days sixteen hours and forty three minutes
i know i know im sorry im late
i dont want the vessel with the pestle i want the chalice from the what
the chalice from the palace
its a little crystal chalice with a figure of a palace
the chalice from the palace have the pellet with the poison
no the pellet with the poisons in the vessel with a pestle
oh oh the pestle with the vessel
the vessel with a pestle
what about the palace from the chalice
not the palace from the chalice the chalice from the palace
wheres the pellet with the poison
in the vessel with a pestle
dont you see the pellet with the poisons in the vessel with the pestle
the chalice from the palace has the brew that is true
its so easy i can say it
well then you fight him
listen carefully the pellet with the poisons in the vessel with a pestle the chalice from the palace has the brew that is true
where the pellet with the poisons in the vessel with a pestle the chalice from the palace has the brew that is true
good man
did you hear that
just remember that
sir giacomo into your armour and you to your place in the pavilion
the pellet with the poison the pellet with the poison
computer mute sound  that doesnt sound normal does it i suppose we should investigate hmm im not going alone come porthos come  id be better off talking to my pyrithian bat
perhaps we are letting our imaginations run away with us i should never have let mister tucker talk me into watching the exorcist last week
hello its doctor phlox  porthos porthos come back here porthos
well now dont you feel foolish
i called out didnt you hear me
i was running a diagnostic do you require my assistance what are you doing here i thought it was movie night
you could hear that all the way from the mess hall
ill make a note of it in the maintenance log
bangs squeaks rattling chains
is this a starship or a haunted house
are you all right doctor you seem somewhat agitated
considering you nearly sent me into cardiac shock
i apologise if i startled you youre certain thats all
i have had a slight headache since we entered this region perhaps vulcans and earth canines are better able to adapt to it than denobulans how are you ive barely seen you the last two days
ive had my duties to attend to the rest of the time ive spent in my quarters reading meditating
then youre due for a night out why dont you join porthos and me
id like to complete the diagnostic
the movies quite amusing
no thank you
tpol i er perhaps youll share a meal with me later
if you like
hello  tpol is that you
stop phlox to tpol
go ahead
would you mind not creeping around the ship like a draxxan cloud viper
doctor
please i wouldnt have imagined that vulcans engaged in childish games
i dont understand
what were you doing in engineering just now
doctor im on the bridge
i hope you dont mind eating here in the galley mess hall seems a bit er oh melancholy all the empty chairs
this is fine
my fifth grandmother made this for each of my weddings  chefs tried to prepare it but he never gets it quite right
yes his plomeek broth leaves something to be desired as well
i always thought so but was afraid to mention it tpol youre sure you werent in engineering today
quite sure what were you doing there im responsible for monitoring the engines
were supposed to be assisting each other its a large ship for two people to maintain
do you have anything to report doctor
i could have sworn there was someone in that room with me
a member of the crew
no everyone except us is in deep neurosedation
then obviously you were mistaken
obviously youve never been to denobula have you
no
the cities are quite crowded by choice not by necessity the atmosphere is vibrant communal
it sounds fascinating
what im saying is that were a sociable people being alone on enterprise just the two of us has proven more stressful than i imagined two people arent even enough for a denobulan marriage a proper one anyway
im sorry i havent been better company
that isnt what i meant
i know it is ironic however that i should be your sole companion unlike your people most vulcans will go to great lengths to find solitude at times it has been trying for me to coexist with eighty humans especially the more irrational ones
such as commander tucker
ive found the last two days to be a welcome respite
i understand but i for one will never complain again when i cant get a good seat on movie night
despite the tragic circumstances surrounding your homecoming doctor lucas you must be happy to return to earth as ive mentioned before ive no regrets about accepting my position on enterprise however it has struck me recently how much i miss the familiar pleasures of my home
youve experienced the nightclubs in our kaybin district so you know the excitement of meeting a new companion or two the intimacy that can develop so quickly when all parties are receptive you humans are a truly remarkable species doctor lucas but when enterprise has accomplished its mission i look forward to being among denobulans again the more of them the better
good afternoon captain how are we feeling today neurochemistry looks excellent theta waves are good you should wake up extremely well rested
phlox to tpol
internal sensors dont show any additional biosigns
i told you it was outside of the ship on the hull
there are no lifeforms anywhere in this vicinity
what about alien vessels
you can see for yourself theres nothing there
you said this reconfigured space could be affecting our systems what if its interfering with our sensors
thats possible but we should consider another explanation you mentioned you were having difficulty adjusting to the solitude of the past few days
i didnt imagine it i saw something
outside the ship crawling on the hull
what about what i saw in engineering
you ran the scans yourself there is nothing unusual on board you said you havent slept much since we entered this disturbance perhaps you should return to your quarters try to rest
i need to finish my rounds
get away from her
phlox to tpol
go ahead doctor
its the xindi theyre on board
well need to arm ourselves i saw two there could be more of them
theres nothing on sensors
then the sensors must be wrong
doctor phlox i thought you were going to get some rest
they were real i saw them
if thats true then how did they get on the ship all external hatches and docking ports are sealed
they could have transporter technology
there were no transporter signatures
what difference does it make how they got on board if we wake up lieutenant reed or the macos they will be incapacitated in minutes dead within hours it is up to us to deal with this situation i plan to start on g deck and work my way up
im going to stop them whether you help me or not
weve searched four decks
that leaves three to go
if there are xindi aboard why are they concealing themselves
they could be trying to destroy enterprise what better time than while the crew is incapacitated  a biosign
there are over eighty biosigns aboard not counting your pets in sickbay
this isnt human
neither are your pets
i cant lock onto it
there must be some interference possibly from the reconfigured space
you said it wasnt affecting our sensors
i said it wasnt affecting main sensors that hand scanner is far less powerful you know that
i have it  its just ahead
doctor
its all right fortunately im not very proficient with hand weapons
how did he get out
i er i believe i we went for a walk earlier i might have neglected to put him back in my quarters
and you simply forgot
ive been distracted i would have thought this could tell the difference between a giant insect and a beagle
it can if you use it properly
youre the science officer you might have offered some assistance in that area
you feel i havent been helpful how would you characterise the two hours i wasted searching for a figment of your imagination
im not delusional
are you certain as i recall you once told ensign sato that its considered healthy for denobulans to hallucinate its how you release stress youve been under a lot of stress lately havent you doctor
its not unheard of but i
you said youve been having headaches is there anything else you care to tell me
im fine
you nearly shot the captains dog
im going to recalibrate this to exclude canine biosigns and then im going to finish searching this ship im not seeing things and i intend to prove it
ensign sato to the doctor
hoshi hoshi
ensign hoshi what are you doing i have to put you back under sedation immediately youll suffer permanent damage
hoshi
you did this
what
you said wed be safe
let me get you to sickbay
you promised us
tpol please meet me in sickbay immediately
whereve you been i was calling you
captain what are you doing up
tpol woke me she said something was wrong
i dont know whats happening
she said youve been seeing things something about xindi on board the ship
youre not concerned about that
im more concerned about you i obviously expected too much from you
youre not real
why dont you go to your quarters lie down ill take over you did the best you could
you are not real
doctor
i was so busy monitoring the crew i never thought to run another neural scan on myself the effects are subtle and difficult to detect but there are disruptions deep within my neocortex you were right i was hallucinating
are you in danger
i dont believe therell be any permanent damage however its obviously affecting my judgment i have no choice but to put myself under neurosedation and ask you to look after the crew
i dont have the medical expertise
with your scientific background you should have no problems
i have my own duties i cant possibly monitor the entire crew
it wont be for long well be coming out of the disturbance in less than six hours tpol im asking for your help
i cant
why not
when we were searching the ship i became irritated with you
apparently i deserved it
you dont understand i was on the verge of losing control of my emotions this reconfigured space is effecting me as well
why didnt you tell me
id hoped to control it but its proven more difficult than i thought the crew is better off in your hands
i doubt that i nearly killed porthos remember what if one of these delusions causes me to open an airlock or shut down life support
you wont do that
how do you know
because your duty is to look out for the welfare of this crew why do you think the captain allowed you to sedate him over commander tuckers objections because he trusts you as do i
im not sure i trust myself
just a few more hours doctor
so doctor lucas while the past few days have proven challenging both tpol and i are relieved that our adventure is nearly over
once weve confirmed were out of the disturbance i can begin waking the senior officers my medical staff should be next they can assist me with the rest of the
we should have been out of the disturbance half an hour ago
there could have been some slight navigational discrepancies
i thought space travel was supposed to be precise
not always check long range sensors
what do you think im doing theres more than a slight discrepancy
this cant be correct were nearly a quarter of a light year from the far edge
at our current rate of speed we wont be out of this for another ten weeks autonavigation is still engaged engines are online why arent we through
the reconfigured space has expanded
but we knew it would travis said our course and speed would compensate tpol
obviously the rate of acceleration has accelerated we need to increase speed
were already at full impulse
as you can see thats insufficient we need to go to warp
commander tucker said it would be too dangerous we dont know what might happen
what do you propose keeping the crew comatose for the next ten weeks
all right what do we do first
im afraid i may not be of much assistance
do i need to keep reminding you you are the science officer
i already told you im finding it difficult to focus
on your worst day youre more qualified to operate the warp engines than i am
unfortunately this is by far one of my worst days
im a physician not an engineer
you hold a dozen scientific degrees
none of them are in warp theory
the procedures for restarting the reactor are in the database
youre suggesting i read the manual  output must be confined to within three hundred and three hundred twelve millicochranes to prevent fusion of the dilithium matrix
that seems simple enough
unless the spatial compression index is greater than five point six two percent or the ship is within two parsecs of a class c gravimetric field distortion
i realise this is a complex procedure
complex this is utterly baffling it might as well be written ancient klingon for all the sense i can make of it im sorry
i understand i just wish i could be more helpful
youre doing fine we have to close the plasma relays before we can begin the startup sequence would you mind
what the hell are you doing i told you not to mess with the warp engines
i dont have time for this
youd better make time doc i told you you cant start the warp reactor inside this disturbance
actually you told me it would be difficult not impossible
that machine was designed to manipulate space to violate the laws of motion you make the tiniest mistake youll collapse the warp field youll crush this ship
thank you for the warning
youre going to screw this up phlox
go away
youre going to kill everybody
cant you see im busy
doctor are you all right
fine
doctor i cant find the plasma relays
ill do it myself
deuterium pressure is nominal antimatter constrictor coils are online warp two should be sufficient
shall we try
the intermix is stable a warp field is forming
whats wrong
i dont know
i followed the procedures exactly what did i do wrong
you need to
what what tpol help me is it the particle confinement
perhaps you should increase it
how do i do that
particle confinement particle confinement
doctor perhaps we should wake commander tucker
hell die
if we destroy the ship well all die
i know
if we cant accomplish our mission billions of people on earth could die isnt it logical to sacrifice one life to save so many
im not willing to make that sacrifice yet particle confinement increase power to the magnetic constriction coils
tpol here
the field is stabilising
its holding
then i suggest we go to warp
engaging warp engines warp one point one point two
pressure on the hulls increasing
what are you doing
lieutenant reed insisted on showing me how to transfer power to the hull plating just in case it seems to be working warp one point eight one point nine warp two
doctor
lie still your neocortex may need a few moments to warm up
are we through the disturbance
yes ill begin waking the rest of the crew shortly
any problems
a few minor glitches it will all be in my log if youre feeling up to it you have a visitor
hey  thanks doctor
how are you feeling
a little woozy
im not surprised you havent eaten anything in four days get to the mess hall
aye aye doc
ill assist you in waking the others
oh that wont be necessary i appreciate the offer but you need some rest let me walk you to your quarters
doctors orders
thank you
ill stop by and check on you in a few hours
as you might guess doctor lucas i had considered deleting this letter and starting over since large sections of it are now obviously fictitious however i decided that my delusional account would probably prove entertaining as always you have my best wishes your friend and colleague phlox
may i join you
of course commander tucker was complaining that it will take him days to realign the warp coils
yes he gave me quite a talking to
he also said and i quote phlox did one hell of a job you must have enjoyed having the ship to yourself
it wasnt nearly as empty as id anticipated
magnify
its definitely xindi sir the hull composition matches the other ships weve seen
it doesnt look like a reptilian or a primate design biosigns
none that i can detect theres no atmosphere aboard
anyone else in the system
no sir
put a team together
aye sir
well take them back to enterprise tell phlox i want a complete autopsy  the major and i will search the port side see if you can access their ships database
its a computer interface
see what you can download
my fatherd love to get a look at this place hes fascinated by insects always filling the house up with bugs hes collected drives my mother crazy
maybe we can bring home something new for his collection
its heavily reinforced
its pressurising oxygen nitrogen atmosphere
after you
a little stale but breathable biosigns very faint coming from in here
some kind of shuttlecraft
more like an assault vehicle im reading a half dozen particle cannons torpedo launchers archer
youd better get over here sir
the dna is identical to the bodies we found they would appear to be the crews offspring
a hatchery
they built this place to take quite a beating reinforced bulkheads backup power systems
thirty one eggs are still viable
they wont survive for long the biosupports losing power
do you think you can repair it
i wouldnt even know where to start
theres a shuttlecraft in their port bay get it back to the ship i want an analysis of their tactical systems as soon as possible
aye sir
did you find their bridge
im not certain there is one their command functions appear to be distributed through various
captain
im all right
we should get you to sickbay
a mild neurotoxin likely part of an autonomic defence system the egg probably considered you a threat
humans seem to have that effect on the xindi
an analgesic should take care of the irritation
malcolms bringing you two dead insectoids i want you to learn as much as you can about them
understood
weve located their armoury we found several particle weapons and torpedo casings
what about the data you recovered
ensign satos translating it well be ready to leave orbit as soon as the xindi shuttles aboard
weve cleared the thermosphere
you might want to do a better job securing our guests
i think its safe to assume its dead
just being cautious
certain insects on earth are known to hibernate
do you intent do shoot me major
its not you im worried about ive been going over the results from the last training session your senior officers have shown a lot of improvement but i think they can do better with your permission id like to schedule some more target practice for monday evening
that wont go over well with commander tucker monday night is movie night
maybe he can sacrifice some leisure time for the sake of this mission
the senior officers do have other duties we cant all spend our time playing holographic games in the armoury
im not sure thats how the captain would see it
enterprise to shuttlepod two youre clear to approach
acknowledged deploy the docking arm
come in
i think we figured out what happened to them one of the nacelles fractured when they were coming out of a subspace vortex they probably tried to make an emergency landing on this planet
according to phlox the insectoids we found werent killed in the crash they suffocated
most of the crew appear to have died when they transferred their lifesupport to the hatchery
they sacrificed themselves to save their children you said the hatcherys losing biosupport how long will it last
another day at most
i want you to assign a team to repair it
captain
what about azati prime
its not going anywhere this is a sentient species we cant abandon them
captain with all due respect why the hell not ive got half a mind to take a plasma torch to that place
what if we found a nursery filled with thirty one infant primates would you want to torch them the xindi are trying to destroy earth because they heard that humans are ruthless this is a chance to prove them wrong
we can bring the eggs aboard reconfigure one of the cargo bays
i already talked to phlox he says theyre integrated into the hatchery walls if we remove them theyll die
sir this is crazy these people are trying to kill us
this isnt open for discussion ill lead the engineering team i need you up here to help travis figure out how to operate that xindi shuttle
captain
ive made my decision get to work
they may know how to make a weapon but these people could learn a thing or two about designing a comfortable chair
for an insectoid maybe they are comfortable
and the power grid doesnt make much sense almost half of its routed to structural integrity
you could probably fly this thing inside a gas giant
assuming you could figure out how to fly it
this icon looks like it might represent the impulse manifolds
give it a shot
i dont think this ship likes us very much
youre going to have to remove the relays here and here that should disable the security protocols
we cant initialise the engines without them
what about the ship on the surface we might be able to salvage what we need
yeah
any word on how much longer hes planning to stay in orbit
the repairs are moving slow
id be the last to question the captains orders but doesnt it seem a little odd that were staying here to save a nest of xindi
the captain thinks its the right thing to do we may be at war but these creatures need our help
meanwhile their big brothers are trying to destroy earth
every day we stay here gives them more time to finish their weapon
look theres a chance well run into more insectoids when we reach that red giant spending an extra day or two studying their tactical systems might be useful
ah captain ive learnt quite a bit about this fascinating fellow perhaps fellow is the wrong word their species is genderless
then who made all those eggs
they reproduce asexually each adult appears capable of producing multiple egg sacs i wouldnt be surprised if every insectoid vessel had its own hatchery id estimate their lifespan is no more than twelve earth years this individual may be one of the elder members of the crew it was nearly ten years old
what about the hatchery when will the eggs mature
without knowing more about their incubation cycle its impossible to say but probably no more than a week at most captain if you dont mind my saying you look as if you could use some rest
weve got to get the repairs finished
surely a few hours sleep wouldnt
contact me if you find anything else
is there a problem corporal
no maam
why are you guarding this chamber
captains orders
lieutenant reeds report
what
you requested a tactical analysis of the insectoid ship
later are we ready
just a few seconds captain
there are two macos posted outside
i asked major hayes to assign them these eggs are vulnerable there are breaches in the outer hull there could be predators around
aside from microbes we found no evidence of life on this planet
trip
were ready start at forty megajoules but keep an eye on that matrix converter take it up to fifty
trip
shut it down what happened
it must have been a surge in the power grid ill need a few minutes captain
archer to enterprise medical emergency
there was nothing i could do im sorry
hows hoshi coming with that translation
their iconography is different from the other xindi species its taking some time
when shes done ask her to search their database see if she can locate anything about their burial rituals
do you plan to hold a funeral
tucker to captain archer
go ahead
i think ive figured out the problem their power grid cant handle our converters
its going to take at least three days to make them compatible
what about the reactor any way to bring it online
its possible
but they lost most of their antimatter in the accident
stand by work with trip help him get their reactor up and running
sir
were going to transfer our antimatter to their ship use as much as you have to
our reserves are at less than sixty percent
im not going to let any more of them die
to get that reactor running again well have to use a third of our antimatter reserves
why so much
every system on that ship is integrated the only way to bring biosupport back online is to power up the whole thing
thats not going to leave much antimatter for our torpedoes never mind our engines
did you inform the captain
i wanted to run it by both of you first
i never imagined captain archer would put the welfare of a few xindi before his own people do you know he spent nearly two days in that hatchery from what im told he hasnt stopped working long enough to even sleep
delay the transfer for now
the captain gave us an order
ill speak with him
wheres trip did you bring the antimatter
no
whats the problem
initialising their reactor will deplete our reserves by over one third
we can spare it were only a few light years from the red giant well still have more than enough fuel get there
we dont know for certain if the weapon is in that system
there are lives at risk here
billions of lives are at risk on earth if our mission fails
im well aware of that these xindi are innocent if we let them die well be proving to the others that theyre right about us i dont know much about vulcan ethics but humans dont throw morality out the window when things start getting a little rough
commander tucker and lieutenant reed also believe that this would compromise our mission
your opinions have been noted now get back to enterprise and start the antimatter transfer
im sorry captain i cant obey that order
you may not be wearing a uniform but you can still be charged with insubordination
perhaps we should contact starfleet and discuss this with admiral forrest
youre relieved as first officer major escort tpol back to the ship and confine her to her quarters
sir
i gave you an order
maam
come in
the first shuttlepods on its way
how long will it take to transfer the antimatter
using both shuttlepods about four or five hours
i didnt realise how badly i needed a shower ive spent too much time in that hatchery
if youre looking for a new first officer you should consider malcolm youre going to want someone on the bridge full time and im a little busy at the moment
im happy with the command structure the way it is this is only temporary tpol just needed a slap on the wrist
shes questioned your orders lots of times but youve never locked her up before you have to admit its a little out of the ordinary
these arent ordinary circumstances tpol refused a direct order in front of the crew i cant have senior officers behaving like that especially on a mission this important
maybe you ought to confine me to quarters too sir because im still not sure were doing the right thing here if the roles were reversed i cant imagine these xindi would do the same for us
my great grandfather was in north africa during the eugenics wars his battalion was evacuating civilians from a war zone when they came under attack there was a school full of children directly between them and the enemy if his men had returned fire they might have hit it so he called the commander on the other side and got him to agree to hold his fire long enough to evacuate the school there are rules trip even in war we have to help these children
this is what you wanted to show me a battle simulation
scenarios like this can tell us a lot about the enemys tactical capabilities much more that wed learn from a standard analysis
i asked you to look for weaknesses in their shields not to play more games
this isnt exactly a game lieutenant the simulation found that theyre vulnerable here theyve got minimal shielding around their impulse manifolds a pair of torpedoes should be enough to take out the engines
those manifolds are pretty narrow but our targeting scanners should be able to get a lock nice work
thank you sir
i apologise i overreacted a lot of the crews on edge lately
they certainly are
i heard things got pretty ugly down there
its not every day im asked to confine a senior officer i cant say i disagree with the captains decision if one of my men disobeyed orders id throw him in the stockade
ive got to get back to the bridge let me know if your simulation finds anything else
i need to see tpol
shes not suppose to have any visitors sir
this isnt a social call im here for my neuropressure treatment doctors orders you dont want me to bring phlox down here do you
whats our status
the antimatters on its way i had a talk with him everythings going to be all right this whole thingll blow over in a day or two
our antimatter supply will be depleted by then the captains behaviour is becoming increasingly illogical even for a human hes preoccupied with the hatchery hes displaying signs of paranoia
i think youre overstating things just a little
you cant allow him to use our antimatter
what do you suggest i do start a mutiny
you have to speak with phlox ask him to run a full exam on the captain
what good would that do
if the doctor can find something wrong we may have medical grounds to relieve him of command
relieve him look i know youre upset about what happened but i think youre taking this personally
how long before the reactors brought online
assuming hoshi can translate the interface about twelve hours
you have to delay it until we can verify the captains mental state
if he finds out what were doing well both end up in the brig youre asking me to betray him
you cant allow your personal feelings for the captain to affect your decision we both know hes endangering this ship and our mission
what is it
a subspace vortex is opening off the port bow
tactical alert captain archer report to the bridge
its an insectoid three biosigns aboard
theyre firing
theyre moving away at full impulse
pursuit course arm phase cannons disable their engines
no effect
their main deflectors charging they could be trying to open a vortex
torpedoes maximum yield target their impulse manifolds
ready
fire
what the hells going on
an insectoid ship sir
you destroyed them
they were opening a vortex they would have escaped
the crew might have been able to take care of the hatchery
sir
we could have kept our antimatter and continued the mission
they would have told their superiors sir given away our position
if youd explained to them why we were here you might have avoided a fire fight
with all due respect sir they didnt seem particularly interested in talking
archer to major hayes
go ahead captain
report to my ready room on the double
aye sir
im relieving you as tactical officer from now on youll report to major hayes
i did what was necessary to protect this ship and its mission
youll be confined to quarters until further notice
captain
dismissed
yes sir
are you done with that translation
almost
i want you to put together a distress call in the insectoid language transmit it on all frequencies as soon as youre ready
understood
theres nothing more important than the success of this mission do you agree major
of course sir
my senior officers dont seem to understand what im trying to do here i guess i have myself to blame in the past ive encouraged them to ask questions but we dont have time for that now i need officers who respect the chain of command and can follow orders
it wont be a problem sir
i thought what happened with tpol might have been an isolated incident but im not so sure now lieutenant reed destroyed a ship that could have helped us im starting to wonder if he deliberately tried to sabotage this mission youre in command while im on the surface you answer to me and me alone is that understood major
perfectly sir
thatll be all
can we talk to you for a minute sir
what is it
id like you to go to sickbay with phlox
do i look sick to you
hoshi says you ordered her to transmit a distress call
thats right
dont you think thats a little dangerous
well be light years from here before the xindi respond to it
we dont know how far away their ships are if we send that message well be taking a hell of a risk
we cant afford to play it safe anymore this missions too important
this mission is to save earth not an alien hatchery
captain you havent eaten or slept in almost two days youve shown signs of obsessional behaviour and paranoia
if itll make the two of you feel better ill go to sickbay for a complete physical as soon as that reactors online
thats not good enough sir phlox has the authority to order you to sickbay
tpols manipulating you isnt she if im declared unfit for duty then she takes over
captain if you wont come with me then ill be required under starfleet order 104 section c to relieve you of command
i expected something like this from her but not from the two of you corporal
ive already confined two senior officers today
his neurochemistry appears normal
theres nothing wrong with him
this scan is hardly conclusive ill need to get him into the imaging chamber and run a complete neurological series
when hoshi sends that distress call every xindi ship that picks it up will start heading this way hes got hayes on the bridge macos posted all over the ship whatever we do were going to have to do it fast
what are you proposing commander
i think its time we throw the rule book out the window
captain
im sorry sir no visitors
you let me in before
i have new orders from major hayes
look tpol was a little rough with me during the last session i think she caused some nerve damage
youll have to speak with the major sir
this is a starfleet ship i dont have to ask major hayes for anything
step away sir
stand down corporal
the captain gave hayes control of the bridge posted macos on every deck
is he still on the surface
yeah
retrieving him and the antimatter should be the priority
id advise securing the bridge first if hayes gets wind of this we could have a firefight on our hands
perhaps we should approach the major and explain the situation he seems like a reasonable man
that would be risky if hayes sides with the captain this mutiny will be over before it begins
well need more people whos on duty in the armoury
ensign walsh and two of my men theyll side with us but hayes posted two maco there
take the shuttlepod back to enterprise
what about you sir
you heard me
hold it sorry
thats going to leave a bruise
all right youre with me
yes sir
well we wont get to the bridge this way
captain
captain its trip
you shouldnt have weapons in here
go ahead
major corporal changs been found unconscious in tpols quarters
wheres tpol
not here sir
hayes to the armoury armoury respond
stand down
you intend to shoot me lieutenant
tell them to stand down
the captain relieved you of duty both of you
we dont want anyone injured put down your weapons
until the captain says otherwise i give the orders on this bridge
go back to the ship
you have to come with us
captain
shush its all right
contact the captain
belay that
i gave you a direct order ensign
im sorry major
its over major take him to his quarters
aye sir
its commander tucker
put him through go ahead
weve got the captain whats going on up there
the bridge is secure
tell phlox to get the imaging chamber ready weve got a patient for him
acting captains starlog supplemental weve resumed our course for azati prime major hayes and his men have been temporarily relieved of duty doctor phlox believes he has found an explanation for the captains behaviour
where is he
in his quarters resting do you recall when the captain was attacked by one of the eggs
it sprayed something in his face
i thought it was a defence reflex but it was actually something far more sophisticated the substance contained a unique neurochemical it infiltrated the captains synaptic pathways causing him to reverse imprint on the baby insectoids its the opposite of what happens when a young animal bonds with its mother
are you saying he thought he was the mother of those things
well more likely a caretaker of course the captain didnt realise this on a conscious level eventually he became obsessed with protecting the eggs to the exclusion of everything else
including our mission
id like to speak with him if you dont mind
hell be awake in a few hours he should be fully recovered by then
i want you and your men to return to duty
yes maam
not the sort of thing they trained us for at west point
i imagine not
you could have come to me explained the situation
we couldnt take the chance that youd side with the captain
i probably would have
yeah
come in
i didnt mean to wake you sir
its all right i was getting up anyway
how are you feeling
oh ive been better are you sure you had that pistol set to stun
captain i hope you understand if thered been any other way
you were protecting our mission trip i would have done the same thing
still i never thought id find myself pointing a weapon at you no matter what the circumstances
lets put this behind us okay
yes sir
whats our status
we just recovered the last of our antimatter reserves
the hatchlings
phlox says theres nineteen of them running around down there chances are theyll survive until the next xindi ship comes along
its time we got back on the road i want you at your post were going to be pushing the engines pretty hard ill be on the bridge
arent you supposed to get some rest
ive had plenty
im sorry sir but the doctor was insistent
okay i guess i dont want another mutiny on my hands tell travis to set a course for azati prime maximum warp
right away sir
one quarter impulse
 there appears to be considerable activity around two of the inner planets numerous ships all xindi
im picking up a large array of satellites theyre generating a detection grid
degra mentioned a security net
seems like weve come to the right place
the planetoid we passed on the way in put us on the other side of it
aye sir
a convoy of ships is approaching the detection grid
lets see them
magnify the lead ship show me the warp signature degra
it may seem odd to celebrate the completion of a weapon particularly one designed to destroy an entire planet but recall the words of enarchis written some fifty years into the great diaspora without a world of our own we are but children lost in the wilderness one day well emerge from this wilderness and our work here will ensure that well never be lost again to a new era for all xindi
degra it is good to see you again
welcome
when can we get underway
momentarily patience
patience is for the dead
youve accomplished a great deal in a very short time
we owe you our gratitude
its too early to speak of accomplishments ill reserve my gratitude for when the humans have been annihilated
ive analysed every link in the grid i cant find a single weakness
the grid is extremely sensitive wed be detected the instant we passed through
we could try disabling it
it utilises thousands of satellites if one of them goes out of commission it fills the gap
what about the insectoid shuttle
make like one of the locals
we could fly in try to locate where the weapons being completed
their shuttle might be able to get through the grid without raising suspicion
captain were not exactly experts at piloting that thing
its going to take at least a couple of hours to get up to speed
take them i want to launch as soon as we can
i think ive found reverse
great but unless we plan to fly in ass first wed better figure out how to make it go forward
cant argue with that
lets cycle through these console settings again try the port actuator
closed
commander tucker is going to need time to install the translation matrix
if commander tucker wants to speak insectoid i have to get this right first
believe it or not that was have a nice day or its equivalent
just get in there find this thing scan it and get out remember whatever information you gather wont do us any good unless you bring it back
well keep that in mind
good luck
thank you sir
thanks captain
trouble
its like steering an asteroid miner with a bad axis coil
their flightpath is somewhat erratic
open a channel trip
sorry
no problem ill send you the bill
i think im getting a feel for her
sensors are up and running lets get this show on the road
keep a sensor lock for as long as you can
five hundred metres two hundred here we go
theyre passing through the grid
were in xindi patrol ship coming up from behind theyre hailing us
doesnt exactly sound like welcome to the neighbourhood
hoshi dont fail us now
your presence inside the detection grid is unauthorised explain
we had a slight navigational malfunction that threw us off course its been corrected
rendezvous with your carrier ship immediately
understood
the detection grid is creating too much interference ive lost them
were being scanned
wheres it coming from
im not picking up any vessels in the vicinity
from the moons surface a small monitoring station the moons rotation brought it into scanning range
lets see it malcolm
im reading three xindi biosigns
have they sent out a transmission
not yet
what are they waiting for
probably for the moons rotation to bring them back into communication range
how long
four hours
target the facility
lock
sir
we cant risk it fire
im still getting trace kemocite readings but not enough to indicate a largescale weapon
theres not much land down there
and what land there is doesnt have any life on it take us down travis closer to the surface adjust twenty degrees starboard
see something
i think so
you did say that most of this things power was routed to structural integrity
and you said we could probably fly it inside a gas giant hell its only water
structural integritys holding
take us deeper negative z axis ten degrees
are you getting those scans sir
theres a lot of activity on the right lower hemisphere i want to have a look inside
the captain said get in and get out
thats exactly what were going to do
aye aye
its definitely in the final phases of construction most of the work thats going on seems maintenance related
ive gone over the scans you brought back thats the explosive matrix if we can get close enough we can set off a chain reaction that will blow this thing to high heaven
the initial explosion would need to be of considerable yield
a couple of photonic torpedoes should do the trick
theres room in the shuttle
were talking about a oneway trip
i should be the one to go
forget it
im the only one who can pilot that shuttle
i practiced on those controls i can get her in
but ive actually done it
captain you want a senior officer on this dont you
ill be flying the mission
captain
how soon can you get it ready
a couple of hours to get the torpedoes in place
get started meet me in the launch bay in thirty minutes im going to need some flying lessons
aye sir
welcome aboard captain
daniels where am i
youre on enterprise enterprise j to be exact a distant relative of your ship were four hundred years in the future
im going to assume you brought me here for a good reason
look out there it extends fifty thousand light years in all directions and it is growing
ive seen it before
i know in the expanse
you know about the alien we found the test subject
he belongs to the same race that built the spheres theyre altering this space to make it habitable for their species its a prelude to invasion
we came to the same conclusion
its getting harder and harder to surprise you captain  ive brought you to a monumental moment in history the battle of procyon five where the federation engaged the sphere builders
the federation youve mentioned them before
vulcans andorians ithenites klingons dozens of species including humans all unified in a powerful alliance sphere builders
the federation wins the battle they drive the enemy back into their transdimensional realm if the federation had lost the sphere builders would have spread throughout the galaxy they would have wiped out everything this species has technology which allows them to examine alternate timelines theyve seen this future and they want to change the outcome so they contacted the xindi and convinced them that humanity was a dangerous threat
they want the xindi to destroy us
without humanity the federation will never exist you have to make the xindi understand that humanity isnt the enemy in fact its humanity that will protect them from the sphere builders when this battle is won contact them make peace
theyre about to deploy their weapon
i know
i cant let that happen
if you destroy their weapon they will only build another you are the only one who can convince them of what i have told you it is crucial to history that you do not sacrifice yourself
my concern is with preventing the deaths of billions of people if thats a problem for history then history will have to suffer
send someone else
i wont do that
captain you have to believe me you are making a catastrophic mistake
youve made your share of mistakes
this isnt one of them
send me back send me back now
take this
its xindi a family medal that belongs to one of the crewmen on this ship there are xindi serving aboard enterprise j
why are you giving this to me
in case you change your mind
i wont
ill have this quantum dated
we both know its from the future
what do you intend to do
im going ahead with the mission you dont think i should
he said youre the only one who can end the conflict with the xindi you cant do that if youre dead
thats if you accept daniels version of the future
hes in a position to know
i thought you were the sceptical one when it came to time travel
our recent visit to detroit has tempered my scepticism you should reconsider your decision
what am i supposed to do fly a shuttle into the system and knock on the door tell the xindi we want to talk the weapon is too close to being launched if the situation were different maybe id consider it but i cant
i dont want you to die its not necessary
i wish that were true
i want four ships to accompany the weapon
well have to generate an extremely large vortex to accommodate that many vessels
even after earth is destroyed there will be residual presence in the system i intend to hunt down and eradicate every refugee caravan every colony every last outpost they have
a vortex of that size will be very unstable you could lose one or more vessels
see that we dont
a message for you
go ahead
commander weve lost contact with one of the lunar outposts
how long ago
two hours
send a patrol we will resume this when i return
someone once said that dealing with reptilians is like bargaining with the sun you make no progress and you come away burned
its not him
the last time i saw you like this was when you delivered the first weapon
that one only killed seven million this one will destroy an entire world
better their world than ours
thats what i keep telling myself but the reality is that a good number of the dead will be innocents and children
its difficult when you have children of your own
what we do is for them for our childrens future remember that
i wonder how theyll remember us
i know these controls arent exactly intuitive
i think they were built for someone with compound eyes
try again good youre starting to think like an insectoid
ill take that as a compliment
can i ask you something
go ahead
youre the least expendable man on enterprise why are you doing this
an hour ago i gave the command to kill three xindi in cold blood a month ago i had phlox create a living being in order to use some of its tissue then i watched him put it to death
sounds like youre saying this is some sort of penance
im saying i wont order anyone else to die
i hate to add to this menagerie of yours doc
nonsense whats one more mouth to feed
just dont harvest any part of him
i doubt that would be necessary
do me a favour slip him a piece of cheese every now and then
certainly
ive always been much better at avoiding farewells than giving them so im not even going to try but im going to ask all of you to think back to the day when this ship was first launched we were explorers then when all this is over when earth is safe i want you to get back to that job there are four hundred billion stars in our galaxy weve only explored a tiny fraction you have a lot of work to do of all the captains who will sit in this chair i cant imaging any of them being more proud than i am right now
archer to enterprise im heading in
four hundred metres two hundred hes passing through the grid hes in
give em hell captain
ill be in the ready room
unauthorised vessel power down immediately
come in
still nothing
im aware of that
its been over two hours he should have reached the weapon by now travis and i got there in twenty five minutes and we didnt know where to look do you think its possible our sensors could have missed the explosion
doubtful
whatever youre doing cant it wait
for what
right now your place is on the bridge
ill be notified if my presence is needed
no matter what happens to the xindi weapon the captain isnt coming back youre in command now the crew needs to know youre on top of things and it doesnt help if youre holed up in here
i dont need any leadership advice
im just trying to help this isnt easy for any of us tpol
dismissed
dismissed
get out
answer the question
repeat the question
how many earth vessels have entered the expanse
i wish i could help you but my superiors keep me in the dark about these things
is this a preemptive strike
i thought that was your specialty
you dont want to know my specialty
let me guess stinking up the room
i had no idea that humans were so resilient its not a trait found in most primate species
including the xindi
theres a reason reptilians are called upon when force must be applied it was a reptilian who piloted the weapon that attacked your world
friend of yours
he was from my regiment i selected him myself
you must be very proud
his name will go down in history it will be spoken with reverence a testament to the superiority of the coldblooded
ill bet you didnt know this but at one time most of my world was ruled by reptiles
i wasnt aware of that
a comet hit around sixty five million years ago caused a mass extinction most of the reptiles died out mammals became the dominant species
how unfortunate
still the reptiles might have come out on top if it hadnt been for a slight disadvantage
and what was that
they had brains the size of a walnut thats very small apparently its a constant in the universe
earth vessels how many
the reptiles didnt all die out some evolved into snakes alligators turtles as a matter of fact one of my favourite restaurants in san francisco makes the most wonderful turtle soup you should try it sometime if youre ever in the area
you want me to kill you
im just making conversation relaying a few interesting facts about the world youre trying to destroy
ill reciprocate with an interesting fact of my own we know exactly where your ship is
is that so
when we lost contact with our lunar outpost we scanned the vicinity and discovered it hiding unless you tell me exactly what i want to know ill dispatch a squadron right now no more conversation i hope you had a chance to say goodbye to your crew
all right but ill only talk to degra
degra
alone
i dont know who that is
hes building your weapon ring a bell now
what makes you think degra would be interested in talking to you
just tell him the name of his third child trenia
degra has only two children
prove me wrong tell him
sensors would have easily detected an explosion of that magnitude even underwater
i say we go in get as close as we can and try to take out the weapon
agreed
this system is heavily guarded our chances for reaching the weapon are nonexistent
we cant just sit here
what do you propose we do
theres still a chance the captain may succeed
the longer we wait here the greater the likelihood well be spotted
if we dont hear from the captain in one hour ill pilot a shuttlepod into the system
and do what
attempt a diplomatic solution
youve got to be kidding
you cant possibly believe that has any chance of success
the odds arent promising but the fact that im vulcan may help me establish a dialogue
youll just be captured or killed
perhaps but at the moment i dont see an alternate course of action
hello again
how do you know me
long story
repeat what you told him
the name of your third child is trenia
leave me alone with him and take him as well
three months into the pregnancy your wife contracted anaprolean fever you lost the child you were going to name it trenia
ive never told that to anyone
you told it to me you also talked about the weapon you designed the one that killed seven million people when you watched the telemetry come in you wondered how many of those seven million were children
who are you
it doesnt matter who i am or how i know all this whats important is that you listen to what i have to say
continue
your reason for building this weapon is based on a lie
what lie would that be
that at some point in the future humans are going to destroy your species
that is not a lie
you know about the spheres
of course
they were constructed by transdimensional beings their purpose is to reconfigure the expanse to make it habitable for their species thats what destroys the xindi not humanity
ive studied the spheres there is no evidence to support what youre saying
ive seen it happen ive been to the future four hundred years into the future
you expect me to believe that
theres an artefact in my right pocket take it go ahead
an initiation medal
have it quantum dated the results will back me up
you could have gotten it anywhere
listen to me you son of a bitch it wasnt any easier for me to swallow this than it is for you but youd better understand something if you destroy earth you wont just be eliminating my species youll be eliminating your own
the quantum dating confirms it its from the future
that doesnt prove the humans telling the truth
it also means shes been dealing with the reptilians secretly
archer told you this
he said he saw reptilians on earth in a place called detroit over a hundred years in the past
the past
so now hes a time traveller
according to the human they were developing a bioweapon
the council prohibited that
he spoke of it in great detail if the reptilians wanted to keep their actions a secret the past would be a good place to do it
how would they get to the past
she may have taken them
we have to investigate this
and quickly the weapons been moved to a safe location but its nearly ready to be deployed
the council must be informed
reptilians sit on the council or have you forgotten if they did go behind our backs we shouldnt reveal what weve learned not yet
what about the aquatics
we can inform them in secret
all of this collusion is dangerous the council is fracturing we cant forget who the real enemy is
we may not know who the real enemy is
what happens if you fail are we supposed to just keep sending people in until theres no one left
thats hardly a viable option we only have one more shuttlepod
youre missing my point
i dont think youre doing this to make peace i think you want to try and save the captain
you re wrong
why do i get the feeling you havent thought this through
you have made your objection clear now return to the bridge
im not just going to sit still and watch you fly off and die
i gave you an order
tpol
let go of me
i wont let you do this
i said let go
what the hells wrong with you
bridge to tpol
go ahead
theres no need to go to the xindi it appears theyre coming to us
four xindi vessels closing fast
hail them
no response
theyre charging weapons
what exactly are you proposing
that we trust each other
you were captured behind the controls of a ship armed with explosives and youre asking for our trust
youre building a weapon that could destroy my world i had to try and stop you
and now that your missions failed you want to negotiate
just consider what i said
you maintain that by destroying your world well be ensuring our own annihilation
thats right
because its humankind that ultimately saves the xindi from these sphere builders
were both fighting the wrong enemy
im afraid itll take more than this antique to convince us
quantum dating has produced inaccurate results before
do you believe these results are inaccurate let me speak to this council of yours present my case
some members of the council would sooner execute you than listen
then help me change their minds
you havent changed ours
ive made an impression or you wouldnt still be here
weve lost hull plating
i still dont have helm control
tpol to engineering
engineering report
that last hit took out the starboard nacelle were dead in the water bridge bridge
comms down
get it back
restrain him
were not finished
youve had enough time
has he revealed the location of his forces
weve been discussing other matters
there are no other matters take them back to their ship
were not going anywhere you cant threaten us
return to your ship
what about him
hes going to a detention centre for more questioning if there are any survivors from his ship theyll join him
survivors
your ships under attack
you agreed to hold off
we grew tired of waiting
call off your vessels
i dont answer to you
ill assemble the council
by the time you do the earth ship will be dust
weve got hull breaches on c d and e
close them off
the bulkheads arent responding were venting atmosphere
get him to sickbay
yes sir
tucker to the bridge if you can hear me ive got coolant leaks all over the place were evacuating everybody out
another breach on c deck e decks depressurising we cant take much more of this
theyve ceased firing theyre moving off back into the system
ensign get us out of here
thrusters are down i dont think were going anywhere
you had no right to recall my ships
and you had no authorisation to launch an attack
the humans should have been destroyed the moment they were detected
the council doesnt agree
youre permitting an enemy vessel to remain in orbit near a military installation
their ship is critically damaged they no longer pose a threat
thanks to an attack that you opposed at the very least we should board their vessel and take them prisoner
it is being considered
on the subject of prisoners the council wants archer for further interrogation
were not finished with him
youve questioned him long enough
he hasnt provided us with the necessary information
perhaps the council will have more success youre ordered to release him immediately
very well
weve arranged for his transport
we can deliver him
hes already been severely beaten under your care
he is the commander of an enemy vessel
we need archer in good condition
if he cant answer questions we cant interrogate him
he will not be harmed any further you have my assurances
that isnt good enough
meaning
it wouldnt be the first of your assurances that fell short
the council has agreed that the aquatics will transport the prisoner theyve sent a ship get him ready
the comm systems still down we dont have a complete casualty list yet so far the news isnt good five people are confirmed dead a dozen wounded most of the hull breaches have been contained with emergency bulkheads
what about cargo bay two
i dont know theres no way to get to it a large portion of e deck is still decompressed
weapons
the aft torpedo launchers working but thats about it i really dont know whats holding us together but lets hope it doesnt give out
commander
the primary warp coils fried it has to be rebuilt from scratch
how long
a couple of weeks if we had the parts we dont as it stands now warp drives out of the question
impulse
ill have to inspect the hull around the exhaust manifolds see the damage firsthand
make it a priority
weve had a lot of injuries down here it could speed things up if you assign me some extra help
engineering isnt the safest place to be right now
indeed weve already lost one captain today
where are you taking me
emergency powers back online well have phase cannons in about an hour
id like you to begin repairs on e deck
ill have to pull people from other areas
there are engineering components in cargo bay two theyre crucial to commander tuckers repairs
aye
theres a vessel approaching
its xindi
aft torpedoes
targeting
the viewscreen
still offline
it appears to be a oneman vessel no armaments
biosigns
one
bring it in
here
no internal injuries numerous contusions consistent with blunt trauma
how many have we lost
fourteen three are unaccounted for
dont waste time on me
its good to see you again captain
damage report  well have impulse power in six hours
aft torpedo launchers and one forward phase cannon are online
have hoshi and travis start analysing that pod
its configuration suggests its aquatic
i was aboard one of their ships thats the last thing i remember
do you have any idea why they released you
i think i may have gotten through to one of them degra
thanks are you all right
im fine i should help lieutenant reed with his repairs
they went to a lot of trouble to let you go do you really think theyll attack us again
theyre not exactly unified the reptilians came after us on their own they might decide to finish what they started
weve run out of moons to hide behind but there is a cometary dust cloud not too far off
tpol
the diamagnetic field should shield us from long range scans
how far away is it
engineering to the bridge we just picked up a surge in the eps grid on a deck
thanks for the warning how far
at present speed about three days
set a course
aye sir
instead of hiding shouldnt we be looking for the weapon
our sensors are still offline
lets focus on getting ourselves operational we cant mount a search with a ship coming down on our heads
i thought insectoid was tough
almost sounds like music
my mother always wanted me to take piano lessons i should have listened to her
its never too late you can start when we get home were getting home
what makes you think we can trust this guy
who
degra he seems like the last person whod come around to our side i mean he designed the weapon
he may not be on our side but i get the feeling hes starting to question his
well lets hope youre right i think were ready to fire this up  maybe not
bridge to captain archer
go ahead
theres an unidentified vessel approaching theyre asking for our assistance
any details
just that theyve taken heavy damage
join the club
how long till they get here
twelve minutes
set a rendezvous course maybe we can help each other
they have minimal weapons all powered down
im detecting numerous spatial anomalies in the area
can you get us through them
i believe so
hail them this is captain archer were responding to your distress call
thank you for coming but be aware this region contains dangerous spatial distortions
weve run into them before
theyve damaged our engines and life support we would appreciate whatever assistance you can give us
well see what we can do
what brings you to this system
curiosity were studying the red giant its the first one weve had the opportunity to explore we werent prepared for these spatial anomalies as you call them seems you werent either
actually this is all the result of combat
combat
have you heard of a species called the xindi
no were new to this region of space
lets talk about your ship we know a way to insulate against the anomalies theres a substance called trelliumd
ive heard of it its extremely rare
i have sixty kilos sitting in my cargo bay
perhaps we can work out some sort of trade
thats what i had in mind
given the condition of my vessel i dont know what we can offer you
our warp engine is badly damaged
we could probably spare a few plasma injectors maybe some antimatter
i was thinking more along the lines of a warp coil
im afraid thats one thing we cant spare
maybe we can make it worth your while we have certain technology that youd probably find useful
without a warp coil the journey back to our system would take three years were not equipped for a voyage of that length
the xindi have already wiped out seven million of my people now theyre building a weapon to destroy our entire world i have to stop them without warp drive i wont succeed
i sympathise captain i will help you in any other way but i wont jeopardize the lives of my crew im sorry
the escape pod can manoeuvre underwater aside from that nothing out of the ordinary
ive gone through the databanks just your standard navigational operational files but i did find one document an engineer asking his supervisors for additional parts heres a translation
the names of these supervisors piral jaina trenia
the names of degras children
i discovered a set of coordinates embedded in the document
its not a star system
there was another embedded number a stardate three days from now
how far away are the coordinates
four light years well need at least warp three to make it in time its unlikely that degra will wait beyond three days
hes all yours he was the perfect house guest as usual youll be happy to know that i discharged ensign ansara this morning and corporal omalley will be returning to duty this afternoon captain
its hard to imagine that well ever get this ship back to the way it was
its a simple matter of repairs well perhaps not that simple somehow i dont think its the damage to enterprise thats troubling you
how long have you been a doctor
nearly forty years
and in all that time did you ever do anything you thought was unethical
twice why
im about to step over a line a line i thought i would never cross and given the nature of our mission it probably wont be the last
probably not may i ask what youre planning to do
there could be more casualties
ill be ready
put together an armed boarding party
who are we boarding sir
the alien ship we docked with
i dont understand
we need their warp coil they wont give it to us so were going to have to take it
captain
get your men together
where are the other members of the council
we didnt want them here
why
weve learned something about the reptilians that concerns us
theres distrust amongst you
you can help alleviate it
continue
we were told the reptilians attempted to build a bioweapon
who told you this
weve also learned that they were building this bioweapon in the past on earth
as far as were aware reptilians dont possess the technology for time travel
you want to know if they had my help
did they
yes after you prohibited them from constructing the bioweapon the reptilians and the insectoids were prepared to withdraw from the council i assisted them so the council would remain unified
you helped them to circumvent our authority
i protected your authority by keeping the council intact
what happened to the bioweapon
it was never completed and the three reptilians were never found
you cant locate them
there are limits to what we can do in your realm
it seems you can do more than we thought is it true your species built the spheres
what makes you think you can subject me to this interrogation if it werent for my assistance your species would be facing destruction
were grateful for the help that youve given us
then prove it focus on the task at hand the weapon is nearly complete if you permit yourselves to become distracted youll fail to destroy your real enemy the enemy of all xindi dont summon me again unless every member of the council is present i wont help fuel your internal bickering
you dont believe her
do you
why should we take archers word over hers
because archer offered something she hasnt proof
under normal circumstances theyd be no match for us but weve sustained a lot more damage than they have this could be risky
one lucky shot to our starboard nacelle
lets make sure they dont get any lucky shots
why dont we just transport their warp coil to enterprise
its tied into their injector system if we use the transporter wed destroy their engines ive got to get in there decouple it by hand
how long
ten minutes give or take cant tell for sure until i see it
if they fight back ten minutes could be a very long time
perhaps we should reconsider negotiation
we cant risk tipping them off we have to take them by surprise thatll reduce the losses on both sides well disable their ship as quickly as we can beam over extract the warp coil and get out hopefully without any casualties set a course
can i have a word with you
not right now
if i had another option id take it
we are no different than the marauders who attacked us when we entered the expanse
were a lot different
by stealing their warp coil we could be condemning them to death
were going to leave them a supply of trellium along with some extra food im not saying itll be easy for them but theyll stand a decent chance of making it home
youre forgetting that were in a dangerous region of space our assault could cripple their ability to defend themselves
not if we do it right
and what if something goes wrong
we can debate this all day ive made my decision
we cant save humanity without holding on to what makes us human those were your words to me
im no happier doing this than you are but were not going to make a habit of it
once you rationalise the first misstep its easy to fall into a pattern of behaviour
im not rationalising anything i know full well what im doing
i cant justify this course of action
we dont have a choice
i wont let you do it
weve had our share of disagreements but youve never taken it out on my desk before
i apologise
whats happening to you
its been a difficult few days i havent had the time to meditate
maybe you should find the time
i didnt mean what i said
im glad to hear it ill be leading the boarding party theres no margin for error if we dont do this right people are going to die we need you on the bridge
understood
doctor
yes this will just take a moment
what is it
theres a good deal of residual trellium in your bloodstream how long have you been doing this
three months
i need to know precisely what has been happening
when i was exposed to trellium aboard the seleya it affected me in a way that i wasnt prepared for
as i recall you were homicidal and paranoid
the initial effects were overwhelming but as they began to wear off i discovered i was able to access certain emotions i wanted more i began to experiment by ingesting small amounts of trellium i devised a way to inject it into my bloodstream
you must have known it was dangerous trellium exposure is deadly to vulcans it eats away at the neural pathways
i thought in small amounts it would be safe at first i was able to control the new emotions my interactions with the crew improved
commander tucker for example when did you realise you were becoming addicted
two days ago the damage to e deck made it impossible to access the cargo bay i began experiencing agitation anxiety withdrawal symptoms
youre not experiencing them now
i was able to retrieve the trellium i was almost killed in the process
this will help stabilise your synaptic pathways but the withdrawal symptoms will return in a few days its going to take time it wont be easy
i understand
archer to tpol
go ahead
were approaching the vessel report to the bridge
im on my way
you should remain here for observation
the captain needs me i have to go
i expect you to report back here at the first sign of trouble
are you going to discuss this with the captain
this is between you and your doctor
good luck
you have the bridge
stand by weapons
run another test if it doesnt hold well have to bypass the entire assembly  what is it
sir theres a vessel approaching its the earth ship
have you contacted them
theyre not responding
theyre still hailing us
two hundred kilometres
target their propulsion systems
aye
fire
their warp drives offline theyre charging weapons
bridge to transporter
theyre firing
energise
thats the access port
stun grenade  go
their weapons are at fifty percent
we have another hull breach on e deck
our port thrusters are offline
we have to take out their weapons
we cant leave them defenceless
if we want to get through this in one piece we may have no choice
the captains orders
clear
cover  archer
captain
weve hit a little snag
theyre targeting our starboard nacelle
evasive manoeuvres tpol to the captain
go ahead
were taking heavy damage
theres a forcefield around the warp coil
trips trying to disable it
try it now
archer to enterprise
go ahead
parsons been hit lock onto her comm signal and
beam her out of here
lieutenant
were venting atmosphere on c deck tpol
adjust phase cannons to a narrow confinement beam target this power juncture
got it
fire
right there
archer
commander tuckers aboard we have it
stand by to beam us out fall back
what you cant have you take by force
weve beamed three containers of trellium into your cargo hold as compensation theres also food and supplies
youre stranding us three years from home why are you doing this
because i have no choice energise
im not sure why i asked you to come see me
perhaps you just needed some company
perhaps
how do you feel
i thought that without the trellium i would no longer have difficulty suppressing my emotions but thats not true
its not surprising that there are residual effects theyre probably temporary
and if theyre not
then youll learn to cope with them
im not certain ill be able to im
afraid
vulcans dont experience fear
you sought these emotions dont expect them to vanish overnight patience
a few tweaks and it fit right in
whats our top speed
three point two that should get us to the rendezvous point with time to spare
you did the right thing
it seems the longer were out here the more i have to keep saying that to myself
those peoplell be okay theyll get home
captain to the bridge
go ahead
prepare to go to maximum warp
aye sir
were in bad shape i cant deny that but were still in one piece enterprise is a tough            ship she took more than anyone could ask her to and then some and so have all of you i wanted to say            thank you i only wish i could thank the eighteen crewmen who were lost like you they understood how            important our mission is and they accepted the risks we came into the expanse not knowing what wed find            with no one to rely on but ourselves but were going to succeed to accomplish our mission for everyone            on earth whos relying on us and for the eighteen
we managed to get into sections six and seven on c deck we found taylor and kamata
that accounts for everyone
whats our status on weapons
mister reed has both forward phase cannons back online in addition to the aft torpedo launchers            hull plating is up to eighty percent
thatll have to do
we could wait hang back until weve had a chance to make more repairs
degras message was clear were to meet him ten hours from now
and i dont intend to be late
maybe thats what hes counting on lure us into an ambush while were still licking            our wounds
ive made my decision we have a lot of work to do i suggest we get to it
aye sir
commander crewman taylor was one of yours wasnt she
she was an eps control specialist a damn good one
id like you to write a letter to her family
she worked on rostovs team i can ask him
i asked you
im barely holding the ship together i dont have time to sit down to and write a letter
it doesnt have to be long her family deserves to know what happened to her
understood
youre busy ill come back
have a seat ill have to use a hand scanner the imaging chamber is still offline            commander tucker reassigned the repair team that was working here he said the armoury was            a higher priority well see how low a priority i am the next time he burns his fingers on a            plasma conduit  youve experienced no further withdrawal symptoms
none
im only detecting trace amounts of trellium in your system hardly worth mentioning            thats good news what is it
these emotions have grown more difficult to control my usual techniques for suppressing them            havent been effective
on earth there is a cautionary tale about the dangers of releasing a magical creature called a            genie from the bottle once its out its extremely difficult to put back in
are you saying these emotions may never subside
you used trellium for three months it caused significant damage to your neural pathways you            may have to learn to live with these emotions
were approaching the coordinates captain right on schedule
no ships out there sir
hoshi
scanning all frequencies nothing so far
maybe theyre running late
tactical alert
its a spatial anomaly weve entered a dense field
tucker to the bridge
this is not the best time for this
stand by trip
reports of injuries on b deck
no ones out there sir
get us out of here
aye sir
captain
were receiving a transmission its degra hes telling us to follow him
stay with him travis
aye sir
theyre hailing us
i see you found my message we have a great deal to discuss            and i dont have much time come aboard my ship
if wed left you with the reptilians they would have killed you
degra arranged for the aquatics to return you to your ship
then you also called off the attack on enterprise
the reptilians werent very pleased about that either
youve taken a big risk
if youre telling the truth the future of my people is at stake
everything ive told you is true
forgive me but the council will need more than your word perhaps            you can demonstrate your ability to time travel
that might be a bit difficult but if you come aboard my ship i can give you            all the proof you want
very well
but there are some things i want to know first
such as
when will your weapon be launched
the precise date hasnt been determined yet
weeks days
thats up to the council
im trying to help you but i need to know my world isnt being destroyed            while im doing it
the weapon wont be launched for several days show us your proof and well            do what we can to stop it
whatd you get
pepperoni pizza
dont worry you can pick the pepperoni off
damage reports
no the captain wants me to write a letter to crewman taylors family
im sure theyll appreciate that
their daughters dead do you really think theyll care what i have to say
when was the last time you slept
i dont know not since the attack
that was two days ago
all right then two days
go to your quarters get some sleep
believe me id love to
i could order you
i dont have time were full of holes the only thing keeping us            flying is a stolen warp coil and now ive got to write this letter  what the hell
tucker to engineering shut down the auxiliary coolant line between sections twelve            and fourteen on e deck
aye sir
tucker to sickbay medical emergency on e deck section twelve
on my way commander
reactor pressures holding good thing i wasnt taking a nap
damron
a friend of yours
a colleague of sorts
theyre the ones we found on earth in the past
and this is the result of your finding them
they were about to release a bioweapon that would have decimated the population
reptilians felt a toxin would be more effective on your species damron and his            team disappeared shortly after the council rejected his proposal
apparently he decided to go ahead without your councils approval
but fortunately you were able to stop him by travelling back through time
i already told you we had help just like they did
this proves nothing how do we know he didnt capture them in the present
you need more evidence
they had this with them we destroyed the toxin but my doctor kept a sample            of it in stasis
this appears to be xindi technology but id like to have our engineers confirm it
have them come aboard perform whatever test theyd like
this proves nothing except the reptilians disobeyed the council which comes            as no great surprise but you also claim that weve been misled by transdimensional aliens            where is your evidence of that
come with me
theres a microfracture in the magnesium jacket thats why it ruptured
i ran a pressure test
tell it to the man lying in sickbay test them again all of them
aye sir
commander
im a little busy doc
so it seems i understand you havent slept since the attack
tpol tattling on me now
perhaps shes worried about you
well i appreciate that but im trying to hold this ship together with spit and            baling wire
has it occurred to you that well be far worse off if you collapse from exhaustion
your concern is duly noted doc but ive got to get back to work
i dont believe so
come again
im relieving you of duty you will go to your quarters and not return to your post before oh five            hundred tomorrow
six hours
please dont make me involve security
archer to doctor phlox
yes captain
i need you in sickbay
ill be right there well commander
i can give you two hours
i believe the number was six
if im gone longer than three there may not be a ship here when i get back
four not a minute less
done and remind me never to buy a car from you captains waiting for you
im aware of that
well goodnight then
we found him adrift do you recognise his species
weve met one of them
what caused his death
some kind of cellular degeneration it started the moment he was taken off his ship
perhaps your atmosphere was toxic to him
i believe our universe was toxic to him his species evolved in a different dimension with            a different set of physical laws he simply couldnt exist here
thats why his species built the spheres to make our space more compatible for themselves
i believe he was a test subject sent here to see if they were succeeding
and if they are youre saying the expanse will no longer be compatible for us
or any of us
were destined to form an alliance to stop them but if you destroy earth thatll            never happen youll be condemning your own race to extinction
trouble sleeping sir
taylor you were killed this whole section decompressed did you find a sealed compartment
no
then how  youre dead and im dreaming
the letter hows it going
i got as far as i regret to inform you
thats a little dry sir
youre not real you dont have to call me sir
so whats the problem the letter doesnt have to be long the captain told you that            you cant think of anything
i wish it was that simple
i served on enterprise for three years you pulled me off the saratoga to be on your            team captain brody was pretty angry at you
id forgot about that
you told me id make a fine chief engineer someday
you will you would have
then tell my parents that tell them about the practical jokes rostov used to play or that            one time when i found that glitch in the injector assembly that everyone else missed            tell them how hard i worked tell them how much you liked me why cant you look at me just            remember me is that asking so much
yes
why
why
these tests only confirm the equipment belonged to the reptilians
theres also evidence of chronometric distortion time travel
the readings could have been fabricated
youre determined not to trust him
no more than you seem to be determined to believe whatever he says now i admit            archers evidence is intriguing but we barely know this human our contact from the future            has helped us many times she brought this council together
and youve never wondered if she might have an agenda of her own
i am not a fool degra all im saying is that itll take a little more than a            few chronometric distortions to turn the council against her
captain archer is expecting me
more evidence
he claims to know a great deal about the spheres
degra i know youve had doubts about building the weapon dont let them cloud            your judgment
weve been working to reconstruct our database
the pounding your ships gave us didnt help much try it now im going to            reset the optical subprocessors that might clear it up when we slipped through your detection            grid we got a look at the weapon youre building an impressive piece of engineering hell itd take            at least a thousand starships like enterprise to blow up an entire planet you know id like to            see the telemetry from the probe you launched against earth
increase the data resolution
i assume you were watching the attack calculating the blast yields boy you must            have been pretty damn excited i mean that beam cut one hell of a swath through florida            thats the name of one of the places you destroyed florida
commander
did you actually see the cities burning the houses the people being           vaporised i had a sister there
commander
how are the repairs coming
just need a few more minutes captain
why dont you join me in my ready room until theyre finished
lets stick to the job at hand
aye sir
the captain is trying to gain degras trust
its one of the warp plasma conduits
it must have ruptured when our sensors were offline
perhaps my crew can help
well handle it
well need to shut down the main plasma feeds
the flow regulators are damaged there are manual cutoffs here and here but            we can only access it from outside
thats very close to the fire
we dont have a choice  if we dont get control of it fast itll spread to the reactor
get going
i could use a hand
thatd be me sir
open that panel and ill talk you through the cutoff sequence
wheres the other valve
over there
i need to open the emergency bypass ports first and you cant close            your valve until i release the pressure from the secondary lines
commander i have a problem
i think the heats warped the metal the panel wont open
use your plasma torch ill be there in a minute im releasing the interlocks            on the first port
this is going to take a while
careful you dont cut through the bypass relays malcolm
the manifold pressure is increasing we have less than six minutes before the            fire reaches the reactor shielding
archer to trip
youve got less than six minutes
understood
you okay malcolm
almost there
captain the temperature in lieutenant reeds suit is over forty four degrees
hes too close to the fire his ev suit cant compensate
malcolm
get back to the airlock
im almost finished captain
thats an order
get inside malcolm i can wrap it up             im opening the primary bypass port two more to go and were in business
forty six degrees
malcolm
im sorry sir youre breaking up
get inside malcolm i can finish
theres no time do what you have to do so i can shut this down
a few more seconds im purging the last port
the forward valve is closed
okay malcolm clockwise ninety degrees
nice work malcolm malcolm
malcolm tucker to doctor phlox
meet us in the airlock
we need to bring his body temperature down lets get him to sickbay
i hope hell be alright
whats one more dead human to you
trip
he had no problem killing seven million of us but seven million and one is more            than you can stomach
thats enough
i guess even xindi have their limits
i said thats enough
aye sir
weve determined there are fifty nine of them
seventy eight at our last count
seventy eight
weve had more time to study them than you
i apologise for mister tucker
i never expected to meet anyone whod suffered because of what id done at the time            i thought the attack was necessary to save my people
i know believe it or not weve had this conversation before
thats right our escape from prison together the reptilians are correct about            one thing captain you have an impressive facility for deception
erasing your memory probably wasnt the best way to earn your trust
probably not  they are all connected by a            subspace energy grid unfortunately our data on the spheres interiors is extremely            limited
maybe i can help
how did you get this
the first sphere we came across was damaged there was a breach in the outer shell
weve never been able to gain access to one these scans are remarkably detailed for a            military vessel
enterprise was designed to be a ship of exploration
if were successful it will be again
computer begin recording dear mister and mrs taylor i regret to inform you that            your daughter was killed in the line of duty she was a fine engineer and she died performing            her duties computer stop recording delete that computer start again dear mister and mrs taylor as            janes commanding officer its with deepest regret that i inform you of her death she was a            diligent engineer very hardworking
tactical alert all hands to stations
report
weve detected a ship theyve just passed through the cloaking barrier
on screen
reptilians
did you invite anyone else
we masked our warp trail i dont know how they found us
where is degra
hes involved in sensitive negotiations
with the humans i supposed the council authorised these           negotiations
no one authorised the development of a bioweapon but that didnt deter your            colleagues from creating one
undock from the human vessel immediately
he intends to seize the human vessel hell destroy both our            ships if we dont comply
stand by
degra
i said stand by
we dont stand a chance against them not in the shape were in
what kind of weapons do you have
you expect me to attack a reptilian warship
if we work together we might be able to disable them
theyre charging weapons
are you familiar with the design of that ship
i did some work on their power systems
then you know where theyre vulnerable where to target our weapons
their ship is heavily armoured
at least wed stand a chance
those reptilians are xindi youre asking me to attack my own people
proceed to our starboard docking port
i want your word that my crew wont be punished
youll all be dealt with as the council sees fit
hes nearly reached the reptilians
hes knocked out their shield generators
fire
evasive manoeuvres keep            firing target their weapons
their weapons are down degra was spot on he knew exactly where to hit them
open a channel to degra
sir hes charging weapons
the reptilian ship has been destroyed
captain degras hailing us
they would have contacted the council and exposed our alliance            i had no choice
crewman rostov said id find you here
repair crews are starting tomorrow thought id try and get them some power            these assemblies are all fused together ive spent the last hour trying to isolate            the damaged relays
you might find this useful portable power cells
courtesy of our new xindi friends damn neighbourly of them
is there anything i can help you with
not unless you can resurrect the dead crewman taylor had a real knack for this            kind of thing but taylors not here is she and neither is crewman kamata or ensign marcel            or a dozen others so forgive me if i dont want the damn power cells  we found taylor over there            outside her quarters she was probably trying to get to her station if shed made it a few more metres            i wouldnt be trying to write this damn letter cause every time i start i hear myself saying what a fine            young woman she was how smart and full of potential and i realise that im not thinking            about taylor at all im thinking about elizabeth theres so many people dead i tried not            to see her any differently than the other seven million so ive spent the last nine months            trying to pretend she was just another victim but shes my sister tpol my baby sister             i envy you vulcans
you think that the loss of a colleague or friend doesnt affect us it does but if we give in            to those emotions they overwhelm us youre the ones to be envied
you need to speak to the council with the evidence youve shown me theyll have no            choice but to take us seriously
even the reptilians
im more concerned about the aquatics they can be somewhat enigmatic but if we can            sway them well have the majority on our side  these are the coordinates of the council chamber
this is nearly a dozen light years away itll take us weeks to get there
theres a shorter route a subspace corridor its located in a nebula less than half            a light year from here that will show your helmsman how to get through it ill meet you at the            far end in three days
will it be soon enough to stop the weapon
ill do everything i can to delay it use caution when you enter the nebula a hostile            species is known to prey on ships that approach it
thanks for the warning
see you in three days
three days
computer begin recording mister and mrs taylor by the time you get this starfleet            will have already told you about jane since i worked so closely with her i wanted to add            my personal condolences i have to confess ive been putting off writing this for a while i            convinced myself that my duties on enterprise took precedence but the truth is i didnt want            to face the fact that someone so young with so much promise could just be gone but im            facing it now and i find myself thinking how important she was to me she was a great engineer            and she was my friend she wont be forgotten
goodbye elizabeth
come in the probe
we couldnt stop it from entering the vortex its on its way to earth
seven million people
everything is happening as it did before
then you have no choice you must find jonathan archer
come in
im sorry about to bother you im having a little trouble falling asleep i think my insomnia s come back
youre here for neuropressure
its been weeks since our last session weve all been under a lot of stress lately i thought it might do us both some good
i think we should discontinue these treatments
why
youve become quite skilled with the postures ive shown you
you told me it takes years to master neuropressure im not that quick a study
ive taught you all i can
look truth is im sleeping fine i aint come for neuropressure i came because im worried about you
worried
youve been keeping to yourself a lot lately even more than usual you spend every free moment in your quarters you even asked chef to bring your meals here
the mess halls heavily damaged where do you suggest i eat
come on youve got to admit youve been avoiding me ever since the two of us you know when we
had sexual relations
thats real romantic when you put it that way
i told you what happened was an exploration not the prelude to an intimate relationship
i never said i wanted a relationship
neither did i
you helped me get through a rough patch and im grateful i just stopped by to see if i could return the favour
i appreciate your concern but im fine
degra said these kovaalans have only one or two ships inside the nebula
it would appear that his information is out of date there are at least half a dozen ships
according to degra theyre not very tolerant of trespassers how close are they to the corridor
within sixty thousand kilometres
well ionise the hull that should mask our approach for a while
i suggest we enter here above this layer of metreon gas it should reflect our engine signature create multiple sensor ghosts false readings if were lucky they wont know which one to fire at
you gave them the coordinates they could launch an attack against the council
archers ship was heavily damaged they wouldnt stand a chance against one of our cruisers
there may be other human ships in the expanse
those readings were never confirmed
this discussion is pointless you wont be allowed to bring archer before the council
then we wont ask their permission
hell be killed the moment he steps into the council chamber
they have to listen his allegations are too important to simply dismiss
do you believe archers being truthful
i dont think hes told us everything but i cant explain the evidence that we saw
the humans could have manufactured this evidence theyd do anything to save their planet
if archer is telling the truth then all the councils efforts will have been for nothing
reptilians patrol this side of the corridor theyll destroy the human vessel as soon as it comes through
ive already considered that we can protect them
what makes you think the reptilians wont fire on us
tactical alert take us in
aye sir
a ship is dropping out of warp
can you identify it
this cant be right
tpol
its starfleet nx class
are you sure its not a sensor reflection
we havent entered the nebula yet
whoever they are theyre on an intercept course
were within visual range
must be the nx02 colombia
its still under construction
i dont think thats colombia
were being hailed
captain archer you must reverse course immediately
who are you
theres no time to explain alter your heading
come about ensign would you tell me what the hell is going on
your weapons wont be necessary
id like some answers first
im lorian commander of enterprise karyn archer my first officer
we should find a place to talk perhaps the conference room youll want tpol to join us
you cant take your ship into the subspace corridor if you do youll be thrown back in time a hundred and seventeen years
how would you know that
because its already happened were here to make certain that history doesnt repeat itself
the kovaalans attacked enterprise as soon as it entered the nebula
phase cannons are offline
torpedoes full spread how long until we reach the corridor
eighteen seconds
all platings gone
were losing speed
hold your course
the trip through the corridor took only a few seconds but it didnt take long before your crew realised something was wrong
no sign of pursuit
where are we
weve travelled eleven point six light years
degra
nothing on long range sensors
captain the stars theyre not where theyre supposed to be
are you sure were at the right coordinates
yes
enterprise was in the right place
but it was over a hundred years early were not entirely sure why this happened but we have a theory we think your impulse wake destabilised the corridor causing it to shift in time
why didnt you didnt we go back through it
tpol eventually determined that ships can only travel through this corridor in one direction
ill notify the crew let travis know well be getting underway
what course should we set
even if we found a way out of the expanse we cant go back to earth wed be contaminating our own culture our own history
cochrans warp flight wont happen for another twenty six years
maybe theres a way we can use this to our advantage
how
we know the date when earth is attacked by the first xindi probe we may be able to figure out a way to warn them or even prevent the attack
the probe wont be deployed for more than a hundred years
your crew realised it would be their descendants
whod have to complete this mission it was only a matter of time before the first child was born enterprise became a generational ship you showed your children how to operate and maintain its systems and they did the same for their children
youve been flying around the expanse for over a century
thats unlikely enterprise doesnt have fuel or provisions for such a long journey
youve hardly changed mother
i beg your pardon
you made alliances with other species traded technology for food and supplies you even acquired a few alien crew members we did our best to carry out the mission you gave us captain
to destroy the first xindi probe but you failed
we had years to prepare but in the end we were only one starship our weapons were no match for the xindi we couldnt stop the first attack but we can help you stop the second we can make certain you reach the rendezvous with degra this time
you said we couldnt travel through the corridor
you wont need to weve encountered dozens of species some of them shared their propulsion technology with us
we got these schematics from haridan traders we can use them to modify your injector assembly youll be able to travel at warp six point nine for brief intervals
the hull wasnt designed for that speed
well show you how to reinforce structural integrity youll be able to reach degra in less than two days
youve made these modifications on your own ship
our plasma injectors are too old they cant handle the stress but your injectors are practically new youre still not convinced
youve got to admit its a lot to accept
we dont have a lot of time you need to start these modifications
im not comfortable doing that just yet
perhaps we should go to sickbay phlox can confirm our identity
they are who they claim to be most of the young womans ancestors were human but there are also chromosomes from three species ive never seen before these genetic markers belong to you captain she would appear to be your great granddaughter ive compared your genetic profile with lorians these base pair sequences could only have come from you
these chromosomes are human
thats correct they came from his father
thats impossible vulcans and humans have never been able to reproduce
according to lorian i discovered or rather i will discover a method of successfully combining human and vulcan genomes
whos the father
commander tucker
its the strangest thing i look at you and i see my father right here around the eyes now the ears those are your mothers wait a minute you smiled
i wasnt raised with the same inhibitions most vulcans have my human side has allowed me to find a balance between emotion and logic ive even been known to tell a joke on occasion would you hand me the coil spanner i learned almost everything i know by studying your engineering logs
pretty dry reading i hope i gave you some handson training as well
im sure you would have you should reinitialise the startup routine before going to warp six
theres something youre not telling me
you died when i was fourteen
what happened
im not sure we should be discussing your future
it couldnt have been easy growing up without the old man around sorry i wasnt there
you were a good father its strange being able to tell you that
maybe you could tell me more about your mother how the two of us got together
she never told me mother rarely talked about you i think it was too painful she cared for you a great deal
doesnt seem like were talking about the same tpol
your relationship was somewhat contentious but you were always affectionate towards each other
i just cant see myself married to her i suppose if we were marooned on a desert island
we should finish up with these injectors
weve doubled the efficiency of our atmosphere processors we can give you those specs too
thanks starfleet will be glad to hear enterprise was built to last
thanks
wasnt that boy denobulan
many of our crew are descendants of phlox he and amanda had nine children
youre not entirely human yourself
my great grandmother was ikaaran
was that
your wife her name was esilia you rescued her ship from an anomaly field
you know finding your ship explains a few things when the xindi took me prisoner they asked me one question over and over they wanted to know how many ships starfleet had in the expanse
im sure theyve picked us up on their sensors more than once
i thought we were going to the bridge
theres someone whod like to see you first
hello jonathan
tpol
its good to see you
living with humans for so long has changed you they didnt tell me you were still aboard
you mean still alive you look well hows trip
hes fine if youd like ill have him come by and say hello
that might be awkward
theres so much i want to ask you i dont know where to start
i wish we had time to get reacquainted
you must give this to your science officer shell know what it means
two a boy and a girl toru and yoshiko
whos the father
i dont know it was probably in their database but i didnt look it up
why not youve got to be curious
some things are better left a mystery how about you did you get married
corporal mackenzie
a maco how well do you know her
we talked after a training session once
yeah you should ask her out
is this taken
please
so lieutenant whod you end up with on the other enterprise did you get married have kids
no actually i didnt apparently the reed family line came to a rather unceremonious end youd think on a ship quite this size id have been able to find someone but
women only make up a third of the crew there were bound to be a few bachelors left over
yeah and it would appear im going to be one of them
im on duty in a few minutes
me too see you later sir
this seats available
she thinks that lorians plan wont work tpol found a discrepancy in his calculations if we exceed warp five point six the injectors could start to overload wed be destroyed
have you shown that to trip
he agrees with the assessment
well have to contact degra tell him we wont be able to make the rendezvous
there is an alternative the subspace corridor
well be thrown back in time
not necessarily tpol spent many years examining their sensor logs from the incident she believes its possible to reconfigure our impulse manifolds it should prevent the corridor from destabilising
how long will it take
about twelve hours
you should have told me my ship could be destroyed
theres only a twenty two percent chance of an overload
id call that a damn big risk
theres no alternative youll be thrown into the past if you try to use the corridor
ive got two tpols who disagree with you
the kovaalans will attack enterprise the moment it enters the nebula if they damage your manifolds the corridor will destabilise again
its our best option
you have to listen to me
this is my mission and my decision
saving earth is my mission as much as yours
i didnt come over here for a debate ive already given the order trips shorthanded in engineering if you could spare a few people hed get the work done faster
youre the captain
you shouldnt have spoken to archer
he had a right to know the risks why didnt you tell him
if they use that corridor their mission will fail earth will be destroyed
youre allowing your human side to get the better of you
you know nothing about being human
i know that for them guilt can be a powerful motivator dont let it cloud your judgment
maybe youd be a little more concerned if vulcan was in danger and not earth
well meet with degra ill speak to the xindi council
but degras not expecting us
archers following the same course of action he did before hes not going to be at the rendezvous
but the plan could work
we cant just sit here and hope he succeeds billions of lives are at stake
how are we supposed to reach degra we cant sustain warp six our injectors are too old
were going to use the injectors from archers ship
do you expect him to simply give them to us
no
youre going to steal them their warp drive will be disabled
my fathers a resourceful engineer hell be able to fabricate new injectors
youre asking me to betray jonathan archer
i know this wont be easy but weve had to make difficult choices before our parents and grandparents lived and died aboard this ship to ensure that someday we would be able to stop the xindi this is our time if earth is going to survive we have to act
have you spent any time talking to lorian
not really
you should he seems like a good kid
hes hardly a kid hes more than a hundred years old
only in the expanse could i have a son whos nearly three times my age who would have thought you and me huh lorian says were going to be married in a traditional vulcan ceremony its going to take me weeks to learn to pronounce the vows you know where were going to have our honeymoon cargo bay three he says ill fill it up with sand that we dug up from a passing asteroid im even supposed to  im even supposed to manufacture a palm tree
its ridiculous to assume those events are going to happen hand me the flux coupler
arent you at all curious about how you and i are supposed to end up together
the fact that our counterparts married doesnt mean that well do the same
youre afraid to admit that under the right circumstances you could have feelings for me maybe you have them already
i should have known this was a mistake
what
exploring human sexuality with you youre obviously unable to have a physical relationship without developing an emotional attachment
you know all the other women on board must have been taken because i cant imagine any other reason why i would have married someone as stubborn as you ill go help rostov with the port manifold you seem to have everything under control
doctor
captain  their sickbay is in poor shape and theyre short on critical medical supplies so with your permission
whatever we can spare
i cant believe this my rigellian parrot is still alive i knew they had long lifespans but
you mentioned something about inoculations
oh yes eight members of their crew are suffering from lowgrade nubilian fever id like to vaccinate everyone on both ships their physician and i use that term generously is very inexperienced and id like some time to give him a refresher course in viral propagation
do what you can
its remarkable isnt it discovering an extended family that you never knew existed did you know that i have nearly thirty living descendants on that ship i look forward to introducing them to my wives on denobula
i suppose when this mission is over most of their crew will want to return to earth
from what ive gathered your great granddaughter would be more at home on the bridge of a starship
we seem to be cut from the same cloth
perhaps starfleet will consider allowing children on board starships one day admiral forrest did let you bring porthos
i can imagine the look on the admirals face when he sees two enterprises pulling into spacedock keep me updated
injectors are still online greer
how much longer
its taking more time than we thought to reroute the plasma
stand by
i want those starboard modules recalibrated first
hold your fire
what the hell are you doing
greer to lorian
the flows been diverted
get back to the ship  go
we wont be able to go to warp without those injectors
archer gave me no other option
take some advice from your old man you dont want to do this
hell alert the others
im sorry
whats wrong
warp engines just went offline our plasma injectors are disengaged
archer to engineering trip respond send a security team
theyve undocked
hail them
no response
theyre preparing to go to warp
disable their engines
theyre targeting our nacelles
take us to warp
i cant theyve knocked out the starboard power couplings
get us out of here full impulse return fire
hull plating at sixty one percent
theyre making a run for it
stay with them
they have the same complement of weapons as we do
we would appear to be evenly matched
get down to the transporter and stand by
bring us in low underneath them target their hull plating relays
weve lost hull plating
tpol
i cant establish a lock
we need to get closer
you heard her
weve lost power on c deck
weapons are gone
two thousand metres
tpol
sir our weapons are losing power archers using the transporter theyve taken one of our eps manifolds
now lock onto their primary relays theyre on
c deck junction twelve
acknowledged
were losing main power
this is captain archer looks like weve got some things that belong to each other
why dont we call a truce and return our respective property
sir they still have one torpedo in the forward tube its locked onto our starboard engine
i know youve got your finger on the trigger
if you fire that torpedo youre going to hurt a lot of people over here
lorian
answer me
we cant do this
theres too much at stake
these people are family im not going to let you kill them captain its over
stand down weapons tell archer i want to talk
you were lucky phlox says the injuries on both ships were minor you almost crippled us my mission would have been over
your mission is over captain you just wont accept it i took the only logical course of action
attacking your ancestors doesnt sound very logical to me
you wouldnt understand you cant you dont know what its like living with the responsibility millions of people are dead because of me
im sure your crew did everything they could to stop the probe
i could have destroyed it years ago i swore to my captain on his deathbed id save those seven million lives you were the man i made that promise to i devoted my life to that mission we knew the coordinates of the launch platform the exact minute the weapon was going to be deployed but our plan didnt work i had one last chance use enterprise itself set a collision course with the probe but i hesitated my emotions took over i couldnt give an order that would kill my crew by the time i realised my mistake it was too late the probe was gone i wont let my emotions get in the way again i will not let earth be destroyed
i could keep you locked up in here but that wouldnt do either of us any good all that matters is what were going to do next whether you agree with it or not im taking my ship into that corridor and ill stand a much better chance of completing this mission our mission if we work together
come in
am i disturbing you
not at all please tea
chamomile
of course
we had trouble with your modifications we were only able to reduce our particle wake by eighty six percent the corridor could destabilise again
if you place an isomagnetic collector here it should absorb any residual particles
im not familiar with that type of device
something we picked up from the ikaarans
i should be able to find the schematics are you feeling better
what do you mean
your trellium addiction have the symptoms diminished
to a degree but i havent fully recovered
youll never fully recover the emotions youve accessed will be with you the rest of your life ah here we are dont forget your tea youre going to have to learn to embrace them live with them as i have theres someone on your ship who can help
phlox has already given me a neural suppressant
i dont mean phlox trip can be an outlet for these feelings if youll trust him the emotions he stirred in me were powerful and frightening i tried to push him away if enterprise hadnt been stranded in the past its possible i never would have married trip but i cant imagine what my life would have been like without him
what do you suggest i do
theres a human expression follow your heart
what if my heart doesnt know what it wants
it will in time it will
weapons are standing by
take us in are the signatures being reflected
im reading multiple images
how long until we reach the corridor
six minutes
theyve detected us three ships are on an intercept course
return fire
the nebulas interfering with our targeting scanners well have to wait until they get closer
they dont seem to be having the same problem
aft platings at forty two percent
malcolm
just a few more seconds sir we have a lock
archer to lorian now
the lead ships been disabled the other two are falling back
well done captain
they must have been surprised when your reflection turned and attacked
sir were losing speed
tucker to the bridge
go ahead
the last torpedo took out the primary drive coil
ive got to shut down the port engine
understood lorian it looks like were not going to be able to
keep up with you
the aliens are regrouping four ships
bring us a hundred metres off archers bow power the tractor emitters captain tell your crew to brace themselves
were increasing speed theyve engaged a tractor beam
thanks for the lift well see you on the other side
sir the kovaalans will be in weapons range in less than twenty seconds
the aliens are closing twelve thousand metres ten thousand
target their weapons
hull platings holding
what about archer
their aft platings almost gone
see if we can get the aliens attention torpedoes full spread
weve lost aft plating
forty five seconds to the corridor
weapons are down
theyre targeting archers reactor
disengage the tractor beam new course one eight zero mark zero
well keep them off your back your momentum will carry you into the corridor
well follow as soon as we can tell my parents that ill see them soon
twelve seconds to the corridor
direct hit the pylons are starting to buckle
reserve power to hull plating
hull integritys failing
forward launchers are gone
divert everything to the phase cannons continue firing
no sign of pursuit
where are we
weve travelled eleven point six light years
are we still in the right century
the stars are where theyre supposed to be
what about lorian
no sign of him yet sir
one ship against four
its unlikely they survived
lorian has years of command experience something tells me we shouldnt write him off yet i suppose theres another possibility since we werent thrown into the past maybe history somehow corrected itself
are you suggesting that the other enterprise never existed if youre right then why would we remember them
bridge to captain archer
go ahead
could you come out here sir
a ships dropping out of warp
its degra hes hailing us
put him up
captain youre early
weve been successful the xindi weapon is days away from completion
the timelines dont support that assessment
what have you seen
the number of lines with favourable outcomes has diminished there is now an increased chance the earth ship will prevent the weapon from being launched
not necessarily timelines are sensitive theyre prone to temporary fluctuations
this is no fluctuation this is a trajectory away from our desired outcome
see that you take definitive actions to correct this the weapon must be launched earth must be destroyed
im not detecting any trellium in your system how are you feeling
the emotions are still difficult to control
meditation isnt helping
somewhat but im still experiencing frequent
you okay
just a mild headache
i thought vulcans didnt get headaches
im needed in the command centre
you notice anything strange about the way shes been acting
there isnt anyone on the ship who hasnt been affected by recent events what can i do for you
i think i pulled a muscle
pains pretty bad
have a seat
weve been running double shifts in engineering captains in hell of a rush to get to this damned council
he believes he can get the xindi to reconsider their attack on earth we owe him a little faith
oh i have faith in the captain but not in the people hes trying to convince
degra seems to be a reasonable man
reasonable i dont think many people back in my home town would go along with that
thanks doc
the spheres are controlled by a network of artificial intelligence this section houses the redundant memory core it should contain a significant amount of information
were hoping thatll include data on the sphere builders
that could help us with the council
our present course will take us close to another sphere
im sending a crew in a shuttlepod theyll join up with us later
how do you plan to get inside it
were pretty sure weve found a way in youve mentioned the xindi have been studying the spheres for decades
were interested in any information you have on the construction of their outer shells
ill send over whatevers in my database
sir
ive been reviewing service transcripts youve got over a thousand hours in an ev suit
i did six months on the janus loop
are you interested in running this mission with us
im always ready to stretch my legs sir
get prepped the janus that includes ev combat training
yes sir are we expecting a fire fight
dont know what to expect
when its finished compiling send it to enterprise
its not too late
dismissed dismissed
not everyone has forgotten what we have done for your people
what do you want
youve turned away from us come back
i cant
i hear it in your voice you have betrayed everything you believe in and now youre in turmoil
i dont regret what im doing
at one time or another you must have asked yourself why weve protected the xindi for so long
many of us have wondered that
its because we can see a future where the xindi are no longer fragmented no longer struggling for existence you are destined to become a great civilisation and now its all in jeopardy because of you
no
you created a device that will prevent a devastating attack your name was to be spoken with reverence for generations to come and instead you have chosen the role of betrayer
how im remembered isnt for you to decide
what have we done to lose your faith
you never deserved my faith
the sphere builders have lied to the xindi theyve manipulated us for decades i see that perhaps the arboreals will and the others
we have the evidence to back it up
the evidence may not be enough the sphere builders saved the xindi from extinction when our home world was destroyed they began appearing to the survivors theyd guide them to habitable planets show them the location of valuable resources theyre practically worshipped we call them the guardians
its no wonder you had a hard time accepting this
i was brought up to revere them i taught my own children to give thanks to them at the end of each day that is what were facing
ive stood before a klingon tribunal i can handle a tough room
the klingons werent determined to destroy your world but the evidence is strong perhaps it will be enough well face the council together i may take my seat at the council table but ill be at your side no matter what happens
bridge to captain archer
go ahead
weve picked up several xindi vessels theyre closing on our position
humanoids arboreals and aquatics theyre with us when we reach the councils location well need their protection
certain members have more influence than others
anything you can tell me about them i need to know what im up against
you know jannar the arboreal hes fairminded a scientist hell listen to the facts i count him as a friend unfortunately the other members are somewhat more complicated the aquatics for instance kiaphet ammansor is a member of the ibix dynasty a very wealthy very powerful family her opinions carry considerable weight when she arrives at them theres a saying its easier to count the stars in the sky than it is for an aquatic to reach a decision as for the insectoids well their names grow longer the older they get so they become a little difficult to pronounce in many ways insectoids are the opposite of the aquatics
theyre quick to take sides weve run into them
which brings us to the reptilians and commander dolim theres a story about him i dont know if its true id like to believe it isnt his daughter gave birth to a son he had a deformity in his right arm not lifethreatening but enough to preclude his ever joining the military commander dolim had his own grandson poisoned
from what ive seen thats not hard to believe
as i said it may be just a story but as a father its always in the back of my mind whenever i have dealings with him
enter what is it
weve located debris its from the ship we sent to find degra
where
seven light years from here within the cloaking barrier of a sphere
i want to know how it was destroyed begin an analysis
its underway preliminary findings suggest they were attacked
yes
commander there are six vessels approaching one is the earth ship
contact the lead ship
this is degra
degra i was just thinking of you how many
prisoners have you taken
were escorting enterprise to the council
for what purpose
power down your weapons
and withdraw
what makes you think i would let you bring an enemy ship into a security zone
power down your weapons now
i dont take orders from you
theyve launched a torpedo
what
three hundred metres off the port bow
you would fire on a xindi vessel
were prepared to destroy your vessel if necessary
theyre locking weapons
prepare to return fire
youre outnumbered and outgunned theres no need for this i assure
you the earth ship poses no danger
ill see you in the council chamber
i look forward to it
five seconds three two
rcs inverter
shut it down
damage
nothing we need to worry about sir
adjust heading oh two six mark three
id breathe a whole lot easier if you had a couple of macos watching your back
dont worry keep my chair warm
good luck
hows your insectoid these days
it depends on which dialect there are sixty seven
is that all
aquatics respect boldness and confidence they view hushed tones with suspicion
ill make sure i project
not too loudly the insectoids interpret raised voices as a sign of hostility
when aquatics use the past tense they switch to sonar
you should see it in a moment
were still two kilometres up
the only way in is through the air these cloud layers are present throughout the year its perfectly concealed
avians
its beautiful
the sixth xindi race this was built centuries before they became extinct according to our archaeologists its over four thousand years old
kind of feels like being called to the principals office
i was never called to the principals office
i was once
move aside
what for
when were done here
youve brought humans into this chamber degra explain yourself if you expect them to leave here alive
im fully prepared to explain my actions theres no cause for threats
agreed weve reviewed the data you sent were prepared to listen to what you have to say
you killed seven million of my people i want to be honest with you i dont much like standing here
we did what we felt was necessary
i know youve been told that at some time in the future my world is going to destroy yours thats a lie
he said the guardians have never lied to us
the guardians built the spheres theyre reconfiguring the expanse preparing it for colonisation
you reek of desperation you would say anything to save your world as evidenced by this manufactured data
its the truth the data is accurate anyone with an objective eye will come to the same conclusion
you have no idea what the truth is your sympathy for these humans has corrupted your judgment
my judgment is perfectly sound
were you using sound judgment when you attacked my ship
you were trying to prevent us from reaching this council
i was protecting this council
this is not relevant were here to discuss the humans claims
agreed we need to return to the subject at hand
i am trying to save my world but its not just earth thats in danger if you wipe out mankind youll be destroying yourself
i refuse to listen to any more of this
earth is going to lead a battle that defeats the sphere builders they know this thats why they manipulated you into attacking us
enough i demand the immediate seizure of the earth ship
any vessel that attacks enterprise will be fired upon
you will not defy this council
we havent arrived at a decision yet
and we never will as long as we listen to this humans lies if this council will not defend its people then it has no reason to exist
wait
you dont want to know
hold this position the exhaust vent
where
set a course oh three one mark four
i dont see an exhaust vent
you sure about this
half thrusters
tpol
hold your course
im telling you
hold your course
some kind of hologram
exactly
you could have warned us ahead of time
proceed along this conduit
aye
sixty degrees starboard eighty degrees z axis we should prepare for eva
lets break out the suits
weve had difficult sessions before in the days following the founding of this council
this is different the council is on the verge of tearing itself apart
you underestimate us
we were all in the same room you saw what happened
we knew it wasnt going to be easy
we are never going to convince the reptilians or the insectoids
then well focus on the aquatics
the aquatics weigh every argument in excruciating detail for a long time they were against building the weapon
what changed their minds
the guardians addressed the council they presented what they claimed was a visual record taken from the future
it showed mankind destroying our new homeworld
that convinced the aquatics
it was powerful evidence
the avians once they darkened the skies of xindus with their numbers we formed the council to prevent other xindis from sharing their fate
your council just might have the opposite effect
perhaps not there might be a way to convince them ill require the services of your ships doctor
the council is preparing to betray its own people
archer has achieved nothing
he has succeeded in raising doubts about us the arboreals humanoids and aquatics are considering what he had to say he should never have been allowed before the council
i couldnt prevent it
and now they may decide against launching the weapon
the weapon will be deployed
for that to happen three of the xindi species must agree
if we can prove to them that your people didnt build the spheres
prove to them or you
my lieutenant simply wants to know that theres a way to persuade the council
persuasion is no longer a viable option you must act with the insectoids secure the weapon
the weapons well guarded the casualties on both sides would be heavy wed be risking civil war
a temporary schism cannot be avoided but eventually reptilians will preside over a stronger unified xindi empire we will guarantee reptilian dominance if humankind is eradicated
understood
if you ever question the guardians again your skin will adorn the bow of this ship
yes this will be very helpful
ill have it sent over immediately ive never heard of this procedure
it was developed by the aquatics they have an innate distrust of the spoken word they respond more strongly to visual stimuli
you need me for something
the transport pod that carried this alien
its in the cargo bay
there are some modifications that need to be made to it
the captain would like you to assist me with the work
lucky me
your captain thinks theres no one better to make these modifications
i agree
do me a favour dont try to get on my good side
i understand you and i will always be enemies
you got that right
i cant change what happened to your sister or any of the seven million but im risking my life im risking the lives of my family ive killed members of my own species all because im trying to save both our worlds
this way
picking up a very powerful energy signature
were approaching the memory core
its fifteen metres ahead
its practically giftwrapped
im detecting some kind of movement
can you pinpoint it
theres too much interference i dont know where it is
but its close
i suggest we work fast
come in
weve completed the work mister tucker was extremely cooperative i know it isnt easy for him working with me
degra when i was on the future enterprise four hundred years from now there were xindi aboard humans and xindi were serving together in the federation thats a future worth fighting for
passing notes
sir
i got sent to the principals office for passing a note in class it was to katy bentley i was inviting her to a party a friend of mine was throwing
whatd she say
funny thing shed already turned me down but after i got in trouble
some women cant resist the bad boys
after much deliberation weve agreed to listen to this new evidence you wish to present
proceed
the sphere builders the beings you call the guardians are the same species
have you manufactured more data to support this claim
a few weeks ago we came across an alien he was adrift in what we believe was a transdimensional disturbance the alien was inside a pod which was constructed of the same combination of alloys that make up the outer shell of the spheres he was a sphere builder
youve already presented this information
not all of it energise
your data states that this alien disintegrated when it came into contact with our universe
he did
what youre seeing is a biometric hologram its the same technology used to train our physicians it was constructed from medical data collected by enterprises medical doctor
how do we know the data used to create this phantom wasnt falsified
humans dont have the technology to produce a fabrication of this detail
tell me is this one of the guardians
the physical resemblance is hard to deny
it is a guardian  we are not deceived by this illusion restore the dignity of our council expel the humans from this chamber
we are open to hearing more
so are we
translating aquatic we agree
please continue
reed to shuttlepod one anything
no sir
whatever it was its stopped moving got something its heading in your direction
moving fast
i dont see anything
where is it
give me a position
its coming down from the upper
left quadrant
are you sure
damn sure
its seventy metres away fifty metres thirty fifteen
i see it
hawkins
go go
five more headed this way move
i still cant pin down the problem with the converter i think its an energy drain somewhere were far from one hundred percent
theres been a development
dismissed
we have the three votes we need
the reptilians have agreed to postpone the launch of the weapon theyll need more convincing before they solidify their position but this is a significant step that future you spoke of perhaps this is where it begins
question those portable power cells you left us were having a little trouble getting them in synch think you can stick around for a few minutes give us a hand
of course
well be in my ready room
listen about all those things ive been saying i just want to tell you i know you went out on a limb
if i had suffered your loss id feel the same way shall we get to work
its over here
come in i wasnt expecting you
there are some things we need to discuss  ive never liked this place
ive always found it to be peaceful
its too exposed reptilians prefer to be near the ground and then theres the stench
stench
of failure of a race that failed to survive
i was surprised by your decision to postpone the launch
it seemed like the right thing to do
i hope the other members will come to the same conclusion
theyll fall into line i have always believed that all xindi long for unification its in our blood
i agree
the earth ship
im assisting them with their engine repairs
theyve found quite an ally in you a pity you havent extended the same friendship to your fellow xindi
what do you mean
we recovered a sensor encoder from our missing scout ship it was in the cloaking barrier of a sphere we were able to extract the final scans it took before they were destroyed by you
i dont know what youre talking about
the evidence is irrefutable we have an image of your ship firing dont try to deny what you did
they left me no choice
and youve left me no choice
the crew of that ship are the last xindi youll ever betray when the humans have been eliminated when the council has been replaced by reptilian rule i am going to find your wife and children and do the same to them your traitorous bloodline will end at the tip of my blade
trouble sleeping
its weird with things finally looking up youd think id finally be able to get some shuteye theres a section of the mess hall up and running in the mood for a snack
certainly
i guess you heard the captain pulled it off the xindi postponed the weapon launch
you make that sound like bad news
ever since the attack on earth all ive thought about is getting back at whoever was responsible
now we are making peace with them
ive gotten used to the anger its going to be like i dont know losing an old friend
you have other friends
is it my imagination or are you losing weight
ah i was hoping someone might notice
yeah im not the only one hoshi commented on it last week
well im pleased to see that my efforts are yielding results
whats your secret
a denaxian tapeworm
it attaches itself to the lower intestinal tract and absorbs nutrients
hold on hold on you have a worm inside you
its perfectly harmless i hardly notice it at all
how are you going to get it out
i insert a standard v probe into my
no no no no no never mind
well its a simple procedure
im sure it is doc i just dont want to lose my appetite
degras dead he was found in his quarters about an hour ago hed been murdered stabbed
who did this
the reptilians have called an emergency meeting of the council i believe their recent turnabout was nothing more than a ruse to keep us off guard theyre planning something im certain of it your ships in danger
keep me appraised
archer to the bridge
bridge
go to tactical alert
it was that last run through the cloaking barrier the coil assemblys been damaged
reduce speed hold at half impulse
lieutenant
im all right im fine maybe thats the problem maybe were getting a bit too comfortable with losing people twenty three men and women on any given mission the limits of acceptable casualties is twenty percent so says traditional military doctrine well weve crossed that margin
theres a vulcan axiom the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few corporal hawkins understood that
that doesnt make his death any more acceptable
no but it makes it honourable
you admit killing him
with pride he was a traitor
he was a member of this council
degra destroyed a reptilian ship twenty two crewmen died i only regret not doing it sooner
youre going to regret a lot more than that
why did you call this meeting
you have a decision to make weve taken control of the weapon were going to launch it
and you accuse degra of being a traitor
we are acting on behalf of all xindi
either you stand with us or you stand against us
thats not a choice its an ultimatum
call it what you will
we wont submit to intimidation
neither will we
none of us will
then we withdraw from this council
think about what you are doing this alliance has lasted for decades
its lasted too long youve become complacent
the weapon cannot be launched without three of the codes you only have two
do you really believe we havent considered that
i can give you three point four with a little coaxing but some of the relays are still fried were in no shape for combat
that hasnt stopped us in the past
you sure theyre coming after us
count on it
i cant believe i actually feel bad about degra twenty four hours ago i would have been celebrating
a lot can happen in a day
bridge to captain archer
archer
five insectoid ships are descending toward the surface
report
the weapons been launched from beneath the surface the insectoid ships are in formation around it
pursuit course
were being hailed
the reptilians and insectoids have seized control of the weapon
were tracking it
ive ordered all available ships to intercept
were right behind you
i hope theres something in there you can use
most definitely
theres a large group of ships leaving the system one of them is enterprise im detecting weapons fire
stay with it keep firing
its the shuttlepod
tell them to stay put and well come back for them when we can
open a channel to degras ship were moving in on the weapon
concentrate your fire on the primary generators
six metres below the aft thrusters
forget the others target enterprise
get the female
hoshi
theyre disabled
the female
generators at maximum power
take us into the vortex
weve lost them sir
why am i here what do you want
we were impressed with your linguistic abilities aquatic is difficult to master ive heard it spoken my entire life but still it doesnt come easily to me
maybe you should have applied yourself more
we have some encoded data we need translated
im not a cryptologist
i have confidence in your abilities
thats very flattering but youll have to manage on your own
if you refuse well have no further use for you get her ready for the procedure
shes surprisingly strongwilled for a primate
well see how defiant she is after our surgeons have finished with her well have the launch codes soon enough
we need to access the data from this meet me in the command centre in half an hour ill assist you
what have we missed
the teptilians took the weapon
have they launched it
we dont know the captains on his way to the surface he wants to figure out our next move and they took hoshi shes gone
who
reptilians insectoids we dont know they transported her off the bridge
wheres corporal hawkins
the sphere had an automated defence mechanism he was killed im sorry major
im sure you did everything you could id appreciate a full report
where are they
were trying to determine their location its difficult to track them inside a vortex
for all you know they could be heading to earth
they cant deploy the weapon not yet
each of the five species has a set of commands to initiate the arming sequence three of them are needed to activate the weapon
they only have two we obviously dont intent to give them ours
what about the aquatics
their actions arent easy to predict but so far they seem determined not to take sides
its more likely the reptilians and insectoids will attempt to bypass the command codes themselves
and that will take time
theyve abducted my communications officer up until now i didnt know why
you believe theyll use her to decrypt the arming sequence
shell never cooperate
she may not have a choice
this could be a command subroutine
and it could be a letter to santa claus i wouldnt mind having hoshi here right now
well have to make do without her
i just hope shes okay
were here to analyse this data not speculate on ensign satos fate
you okay
im fond of hoshi as well but we cant allow her situation to become a distraction
any luck
theres a great deal of data to analyse but weve made some progress we know the spheres are connected by a subspace energy grid but four of them appear to be integral to that connection
closest ones here weve designated it sphere forty one
integral how
i believe they act as control spheres allowing the network to operate in concert
if we can damage one of them would it disrupt the entire grid
maybe it also might have no effect we just dont have enough information yet
keep at it
aye sir
cooperate and this wont be necessary wait after the injection the parasites will invade your neocortex once they begin reconfiguring your synaptic pathways youll me much more compliant before your primate brain is too badly damaged to understand i want to thank you for helping us destroy your world
if theyd stayed in the vortex we wouldnt have found them
theyre less than four light years from here
why have they stopped they could have been half way to earth by now
theyre attempting to arm the weapon the propulsion system has to be offline to do it
how quickly can we get there
that wouldnt be wise theyve been joined by at least a dozen vessels
you have nearly as many ships
you may have noticed that reptilians and insectoids are more belligerent than we are their ships are armed accordingly
were no match for them
weve been outgunned before sir we did not come all this way to give up without a fight
would the aquatics be a match for them
their ships are extremely powerful but theyve seen your evidence theyre not convinced
that was before the reptilians murdered degra and stole the weapon were looking at civil war can they afford to sit back and do nothing let me talk to them
now isnt the time to dissolve the council
so we should leave our fate in the hands of the reptilians and the insectoids
i disagree the evidence the humans provided cant be ignored
i didnt quite catch that last part
they have agreed to meet with us but dont expect much captain
how long do they plan to keep us waiting
you have to deal with the aquatics on their terms
theyre extremely deliberate in everything they do
you all right
my species doesnt like the water
theyre here
thank you for seeing me im afraid my communications officer was abducted by the reptilians
that is regrettable but her presence is no longer necessary weve had time to study your language
then ill get to the point we need your help
we made our position clear the evidence is intriguing but far from conclusive
we require more time to evaluate it
and if my world gets torn to rubble in the meantime
the reptilians and the insectoids cannot deploy the weapon on their own
that may not be true
i believe they took my officer to help them decipher a third launch code after all your deliberations you may find a decisions been made without you
this changes nothing
just because the reptilians choose to act rashly does not mean we will do the same
so youd rather sit back and do nothing
captain
while they condemn all five of your species to extinction
you may return to your ship youll be informed of our decision
one last question have these guardians told you where youll establish your new home world the ones humans are destined to destroy is it here in the expanse in case you havent noticed the spheres are turning it into a transdimensional wasteland none of you will be able to survive
you say the guardians have helped you have they ever tried to disable the spheres because weve found a way
help me save my people and i can help you save yours
report
shes penetrated the first layer of encryption nothing further
you understand what we want you to do
im to bypass the aquatic encryption protocols
and you realise we need this done quickly
im not familiar with these cyphers im trying
are you
shes more resistant than i imagined prepare her for another procedure
you would sacrifice yourself to stop us dont worry you wont have to live with your guilt for long
commander i cant access the arming matrix shes added a layer of encryption
you were ordered to watch her
a deflector pulse might disrupt the subspace links
it wouldnt generate enough power
we could tie the impulse reactors directly into the array
sure if you want to rupture every eps conduit on the ship
the captain told the aquatics we could disable these spheres
and im trying not to make a liar out of him
really
what do you mean by that
youve dismissed all of my proposals
when you come up with one that doesnt involve blowing ourselves up ill be a little more enthusiastic
or you might surprise me with an idea of your own
maybe you havent had time to meditate i dont know but whatevers going on with you lately ive had about enough ill work on this in engineering call me if you have any more brilliant ideas
commander trip everything thats happened recently has caused me to become slightly emotional
ive noticed
i apologise
forget about it
i wish i could it may take some time before i regain my control it will be difficult to do especially on my own
this hasnt been easy for any of us
you know how much i appreciate what you did for me when this is all over if you want to talk im all ears why dont we take another crack at this
the council has disbanded the weapon is under our control
excellent deploy it immediately
as soon as we decrypt the third launch code weve encountered some difficulties
the longer you delay the more likely the time lines will shift against you
then perhaps you can provide more of your valuable assistance help us get the code
thats not possible
it should be a simple matter to peer into the past extract the necessary data
we only detect large fluctuations in the timescape the fine details are obscured
really youve seen more than enough detail to learn how to meddle in our affairs to turn the xindi species against each other
everything weve done has been to protect the xindi
then finish what youve started if its within your power
the time lines are in constant flux many of them favour the primates and the arboreals some even favour the humans unless thats the outcome you desire i suggest you find a way to launch the weapon
this appears to be some kind of interspatial manifold on the surface of sphere forty one
what they use to connect the spheres
thats what were thinking tpols figured out a way to target it with a deflector pulse
well done
we havent exactly got all the details worked out yet
then youd better keep at it if the aquatics decide to help us they might want to hear those details
captain i hope you didnt make them any promises
well keep working
please do
any word
its only been three hours the council once needed to resolve a simple logistical matter it took the aquatics six days to agree to attend the meeting
im surprised you were ever able to get anything done
on the contrary their prudence was usually the only thing that kept the council from dissolving into chaos thats why degra had them build the weapon he didnt want the reptilians and insectoids to have too much control
thats actually something i wanted to discuss with you if were successful and we destroy the weapon
whats to prevent us from building another one i knew degra for many years he could be difficult uncompromising we argued often for instance when he insisted that we meet with you but when degra spoke only a fool would ignore him he believed there was a future between your people and ours when this is over i intend to see if he was right
captain archer please report to the bridge
report
six vessels approaching sir all aquatic
that was remarkably fast
open a channel to the lead ship
weve considered your proposal
and
we will help you intercept the weapon
thank you
we expect you to honour our agreement
you will attempt to disable the spheres
how do these developments affect the time line
its difficult to say they continue to fluctuate however most now indicate the humans will prevail
then the time has come for us to intervene
is there another problem
quite the opposite
the third launch code
we have complete access
it appears the primate was useful after all take her back to her cell initiate the prearming protocols inform me when the weapon is ready for launch
have you assembled your boarding party
ready to deploy on your command
i wish i was leading it myself
your place is on the bridge sir
no offence major its just that ensign sato is a friend heres my report on corporal hawkins
thank you would you like to go over my rescue plan
first id like to know if we have a problem
sir
if you blame me for the corporals death
permission to speak freely ive never liked putting my people under someone elses command youre senior tactical officer but theyre my team i cant help but think that if id been there things might have turned out differently
i did everything i could things happened very fast
i understand
im not finished hawkins may well have been a maco but he was my responsibility out there
when we first came aboard enterprise we definitely felt like outsiders
if i contributed to that i apologise
my point is none of us feel that way anymore were all part of the same crew no matter which uniform we wear dont worry about ensign sato well bring her home
id almost forgotten what chef can do with a steak i hope the crew forgives me for not patching up the galley sooner
ive heard no complaints except from chef of course
when this is all over i plan on having a little chat with the starfleet quartermaster about what they put in those ration packs
when this is all over i wont be complaining about the food ill just be happy to get back to our original mission
hope you plan on swinging by earth first i told the engineering team id buy them a few rounds at the 602 club youre both invited of course
i wouldnt miss it
what about you
you may buy me a drink if you wish
i meant what are your plans for the future its been a long time since youve been to vulcan
the high command would be lucky to get you back
there are some colleagues id enjoy seeing again but ive considered formalising my service with starfleet
i may be able to pull some strings get you out of basic training
can you imagine the look of sovals face when he sees her in a starfleet uniform please let me be there
i said i was considering it
bridge to the captain
go ahead
were approaching the coordinates
tactical alert im on my way
activate the reactor
yes lieutenant
commander dolim
the final arming sequence has begun
excellent inform me when you are ready ill be in my thermal chamber
what is it
a vortex is opening
where
bearing two seven nine range four thousand kilometres were you expecting reinforcements
no
arboreals
send a patrol to intercept them
more vortexes are opening fourteen eighteen ships aquatics six ships approaching the weapon
target them have commander kolos squadron maintain position
theyre moving to intercept but theyre keeping a substantial force around the weapon
feel like taking them on
give me the word sir
this is captain archer cut us loose
sir the humans
steady travis
theyre breaking off
have all ships concentrate their fire on the weapon
were in range
fire
theyre targeting the primary generators
continue the arming sequence
minor damage to the starboard nacelle were still in the fight
bring us around for another pass
target the earth vessel
we cant sir the aquatics are protecting them
captain ive located ensign sato shes on board one of the reptilian vessels
can you get a transporter lock
shes somewhere on the first three decks i cant pinpoint her exact location
send major hayes and his team
aye sir
weve lost eight vessels weve only disabled two of theirs were no match for the aquatics
lieutenant
we must deploy the weapon now
we need another five minutes
in another five minutes it will be destroyed
and you along with it
ensign ensign hayes to enterprise enterprise respond we should get back to the beamin point
the reptilians are under attack
if we dont act the weapon will be destroyed
the timelines now indicate that is the likely outcome
proceed
captain theres a massive anomaly forming near the weapon two more
keep us clear of them travis
well have to pull back
do what you can but keep us in firing range
aye sir
captain archer
go ahead
the anomalies are creating a barrier between us and the weapon
we cant get through
hayes to enterprise
go ahead
weve got sato
archer to tucker lock onto major hayes
i wish i could sir the last anomaly knocked the transporter offline tell them to stand by
archer to hayes weve got a malfunction can you hold your position
affirmative
the intruders are trapped on level seven
and the anomalies
theyve disabled three of the aquatic ships
the guardians will not let us fail
tucker to hayes
go ahead
im ready to get you out but i can only transport two
at a time im going to have to reset the buffer
take her lock on kelly and sato
ready for two more
you two are next
i could use a change of scenery
stand by major
commander dolim
whats your status
weve completed the arming sequence
captain the power readings from the weapon are increasing
theyre preparing to launch
get us close travis
what about the anomalies
i said take us in
aye sir
ready to launch on your order commander
open a vortex set a course for earth
theyre gone
doctor
i told him i was ready for duty
im afraid hes a bit of a mother hen
hows ensign sato
her biosigns are stable
thank you for bringing her home
all in a days work use mckenzie
what
she knows the team rely on her
no more of that talk thats an order
cardiostimulator step away please
increase by point two joules
how long before it reaches earth
ten hours
could an aquatic ship reach it in time
doubtful they have powerful weapons but their speed is limited
degras ship is considerably faster
what are we waiting for
the ship isnt wellarmed it would be useless against the weapon
we might be able to get a team on board disable it from the inside
the reptilians will have soldiers stationed aboard the weapon
well deal with them when we get there
captain the aquatics joined us only because you promised to neutralise the spheres they expect you to fulfil that promise
the future of our people is at stake as well
are you ready
i believe so we have a plan to disable sphere forty one
if were right it should disrupt the entire network
then as soon as we undock set a course for sphere forty one
at ease ive just come from sickbay where the doctor assures me that sergeant kemper and ensign sato will make full recoveries unfortunately major hayes injuries were more severe he didnt survive im sorry weve got less than ten hours before this weapon reaches earth the captain wants to take a team aboard to destroy it i dont imagine the reptilians will make this easy for us but thats why youre here thats why major hayes picked each one of you for this mission because he knew youd get the job done i need three volunteers  woods ramira forbes assemble your gear meet me at the starboard airlock in ten minutes
how is she
stable the xindi parasites were no match for my osmotic eel
i need to talk to her
shes undergone a severe neural trauma
shes been inside the weapon i have to know what she saw
it should be safe to revive her in two hours no less
all right have her taken aboard degras ship right away
shes in no condition to be moved
i dont have any choice doctor
you could kill her
i want her on that ship in twenty minutes
shell need another cortical treatment at least let me come with you
theres a medical bay aboard degras ship show lieutenant reed how to do it
hes not a doctor
phlox youre needed here
the insectoids
the anomalies worked to our advantage
we were fortunate
it was more than good fortune the human claims the guardians control the spheres
he also started a civil war between our species
the human didnt kill degra you did
degra was a traitor
im no longer certain of that
then its a good thing we already have your launch codes
lock weapons on their ship
sir
i wont risk any more interference fire
malcolm hang on bring me back a piece of that weapon a souvenir
with pleasure all set sir
when were finished well meet you at the rendezvous coordinates
well be there captain good luck
i expect you to keep him in line
ill do my best
if they had made us the dominant species before the wars our homeworld would still exist
and our avian brothers would still fill the skies
we should be grateful that the guardians have finally come to their senses once earth is destroyed the reptilians will take their rightful place at the head of a new xindi empire
theyre nearly three hours ahead of us but this vessel is faster were closing the gap
it may be faster but its not wellarmed how many ships are escorting the weapon
i cant tell
the only way were going to be able to destroy this thing is from the inside any luck
all of degras schematics are encrypted
were going to need hoshi to help us
shes in no condition to come up here
i wish i had a choice malcolm
sir shes barely conscious
can you transfer that to a padd something portable
the favourable timelines continue to diminish
they should be increasing the weapon has almost reached its target
but the earth ship is on course for our primary sphere accelerate the transformation around that sphere they mustnt be allowed to intervene
report
weve realigned the main power grid it should increase the deflector pulse threefold maybe four but its going to fry just about every system on board
be prepared to initiate the pulse within two hours
i dont think you heard what i just said we try this and the ships going to come apart at the seams
two hours mister tucker
the captain told the xindi wed try to knock these things out he didnt say anything about demolishing enterprise in the process
has it occurred to you whats going to happen if captain archer fails if earth is destroyed
every day
good then youve already come to the conclusion that without humanity theres no one to combat these sphere builders their expanse will continue to grow encompassing one system after another including vulcan your world is no longer the only one in jeopardy two hours
i think weve got a problem
what is it
sphere forty one
are you certain these are the coordinates
yep there shouldnt be anything on sensors not with the cloaking barrier but there it is and its getting bigger
have you analysed it
could be spatial anomalies but theyre clustered much tighter than weve ever seen them
theyre transforming the space around that sphere not unlike the disturbance where we found that transdimensional being they obviously expected us
if were going to disable the network well need to get within a kilometre of the surface
if the ship were to enter that disturbance the entire crew would be dead within minutes i could synthesise a neuraleptic compound that would keep us conscious for approximately twelve minutes im afraid theres nothing i can do to prevent epidermal decay
twelve minutes wont be enough
perhaps i can extend it but not by much i encourage you and mister tucker to encourage alternatives there must be something you can do to abbreviate your plan
any luck ensign
im not feeling very well do you think you can get phlox to come down here
were on degras ship hoshi phlox isnt here
im not sure what im supposed to be doing
the schematics for the weapon degra encrypted them before he was killed youve been trying to decipher them
i gave them the third code they wouldnt have been able to arm the weapon if i hadnt given them the third code
you were drugged hoshi you had no choice
i did i should have fought harder
you need to finish what youre doing youre almost there were going to board the weapon try to overload the power systems but we cant do that until we can read these schematics
i tried to jump but i wasnt fast enough
you need to finish this
youve got the three codes so why dont you just kill me didnt you say youre going to kill me
youve got to pull yourself together just for a little while longer you need to complete the decryption everything hinges on it do you understand
i understand
when we exit the vortex how close will we be
approximately two million kilometres from earth
two million
if we had all five codes we could begin the firing sequence immediately but with three well need additional time wed be vulnerable if we dropped into normal space any closer to the target
do what ever it takes to fire the weapon as quickly as possible
you wanted to see me sir
i think ive found a way to boost the deflector pulse without tearing the ship apart but its going to mean transferring all impulse power to the array
when
as soon as we reach the sphere
sir
sorry travis youre going to have to get us to the manifold on thrusters only
thats tying my hands commander especially with the ticking clock
you can do it look over these schematics familiarise yourself with the features of the sphere
we wont be able to transport directly onto the control platform its too heavily shielded well have to beam in and out no deeper than this peripheral framework
what if you need to board the weapon before your crewman completes her decryptions
im taking her with me
sir shes hardly in any shape
shes been there malcolm thats where she deciphered that third launch code
she was drugged theres no reason to believe that shell remember anything
shes coming with me i want you and your team to beam in right before we do secure the closest route to the platform
ill give everyone a chance to get to the outer framework youll be in charge of helping hoshi
and you sir
ive no plans of dying on that weapon malcolm im going to see what else shes come up with
this is a very important day jonathan
i dont have time for this
itll only take a minute you see the fellow in the blue jacket near the left hand of the dais thats you a little more than seven years from now you and the others are about to make history do you remember i told you about a federation
what about it
i work with some people who are going to be pretty angry with me for telling you this but youre going to be an integral part of forming that federation youre down there right now with vulcans andorians and tellarites getting ready to sign the charter the membership is going to grow dozen eventually hundreds of species a united federation of planets
i have a team preparing to board the weapon ive got other things to think about right now
let reed or one of the others go to the control platform
what are you talking about
its too great a risk if youre killed none of this will happen at least not the way its supposed to happen
then itll happen some other way whos to say whether itll be better or worse
its essential you be a part of this
where are we what planet
earth
seems to me its just as essential that earth be around for this too
lieutenant reed can work with sato  they are not crucial to the future of mankind you are
my mission is to save earth not your federation
you cant ignore your place in history
my place is on that control platform now get me the hell back to degras ship
and if its not too much of an inconvenience id appreciate it if youd contact my first wifes third husband groznik tell him that hes welcome to keep the aldebaran drum set i loaned him oh they have a child named indaura a sweet little girl she must be eight or nine by now well i would like to leave her my botanical library she always had a flair for plants computer pause recording everythings ready here
commander tucker has completed his modifications to the deflector i apologise if i interrupted you
oh no dont be silly i was simply dictating a letter to my colleague doctor lucas he offered to make sure my affairs were in order in the event that er well you know
i have always found it distracting to think of death especially when entering a dangerous situation
hope for the best prepare for the worst i dont know about vulcans but denobulans take great pleasure in bequeathing their belongings to farflung relatives
were not dead yet
bridge to tpol
go ahead
were approaching the coordinates
take us out of warp hope for the best doctor
its grown its a hundred thousand kilometres deeper than when we first detected it
ive enhanced the neuraleptic compound as much as i can i strongly advise we remain in the disturbance no longer than fifteen minutes
are you ready to release the compound then proceed stand by to charge the deflector set a course ensign
what have you guys figured out
weve got to disable the reactor at a specific point during the inversion sequence but we dont know the sequence if its not done in the right order internal safeguards will kick in and itll be impossible to create an overload
ive found the sequence but decrypting its another story your friend degra didnt make this easy
i wish i could tell you to take your time
the first time you came to visit me in brazil
it didnt stop raining for a week
i had a bug then too a tropical bacterium not a reptilian parasite i was sick as a dog but i wanted to make a good impression
when we get back home ill see to it you get some rr in norway or canada someplace where theres not a tropical bug in sight
or reptiles
or reptiles keep at it ill get these to the bridge
weve gotten close enough to isolate their signatures
the insectoid ship is no longer with them
why would they leave the vortex
we have no idea all we know is that the weapon is being escorted by a single reptilian vessel dolims
at least well only have one ship to contend with
here we go
doctor
fifteen minutes and counting
any sign of the sphere
its too soon
hold your course
degras vessel is less than twenty minutes behind us
lieutenant were about to drop into normal space
stand by to initiate the firing sequence
were ready
are you detecting any earth vessels near the coordinates
no vessels but there is one small orbital station unarmed
let me see earth
enlarge its a shame all that water the aquatics would feel at home here
ive got it
how far
twenty thousand kilometres
thirteen minutes left
as soon as we make visual contact go to thrusters set a heading to latitude fifteen degrees north deflector
standing by
theyre eight hundred thousand kilometres ahead
get your team ready to go
aye sir
dolims changing course theyre heading for a space station
are we in visual range  yosemite three
a military installation
a research post usually thirty to forty civilians aboard hail them on this frequency
the weapons emitting disruption waves i cant get anything through
fifteen degrees north
drop to two thousand metres track starboard eighty two mark zero
aye
doc theres something weird happening to my skin
me too
it was expected try not to scratch it eleven minutes remaining
the guardian said that once earth is gone were to destroy all human colonies i see no reason not to begin with this station target fire when ready
theyre heading back towards the weapon
ten degrees port slow to thirty kph im transferring the target point to the deflector array
got it
begin
fish in a barrel
less than ten minutes to go
what the hells going on power just fell ten percent
im picking up explosions on e deck
bridge to engineering report
im losing the beam
there are nine alien lifesigns aboard they appear to be transdimensional beings
hows that possible
this disturbance were in its obviously been altered enough to sustain them
whos on degras ship
eight primates three arboreals and seven humans
have their weapons been upgraded
no sir
pathetic prepare to intercept
theyre arming their torpedoes
sir
hows hoshi doing
shes holding up she and the macos are at the transporter device
remember no heroics just get us in and then keep them off your ass
theres another vessel approaching at high warp theyre asking for you
youre not using your head pinkskin that ship youre on is no match for the reptilian
im busy shran what are you doing here
you should be impressed we managed to track you through the vortex i anticipated that youd need some help
corporal kelly to the bridge
go ahead
our weapons are passing right through them
youve got to stop this if i dont get full power back this is going to take three four minutes longer than weve got
we cant afford three or four minutes corporal kelly listen to me very closely modulate your weapons to a rotating frequency of thirty two point six teracycles
doctor
our transdimensional friend the one we found in the pod i had quite a few hours to study his physiology lets hope my memory serves me well
ill be right in front of you gentlemen
keep a low profile
were matching speed
you said there were no human vessels in the vicinity
theyre not human
destroy them both
that third torpedo almost got you be careful prepare to come about to port
stay below me
well need to get within a kilometre of the weapon
just stay below me
lets fight back this time shall we bring the forward cannons online
go
and tell archer were not even any more he owes me
its coming back tell them to keep doing what theyre doing
walker to the bridge
go ahead
weve secured engineering but i dont think weve seen the last of them
its time for you to work your magic mister tucker within five minutes everyone on this ship is going to start dying
no pressure
okay bring up the inversion sequence
start with the third one from the left
got it
the second from the right
hoshi
im all right the first one on the left is next
commander sensors show the humans are no longer aboard degras vessel
these ships are drawing us away from the weapon get us back
whats going on
ignore it commander youve got less than two minutes
got it two to go
hoshi
reed to archer
go ahead
im pretty sure that was the last one sir
good work now get back here
tpol tpol
all right take us to full impulse get us out of here
wait a minute im almost there
you dont have a minute commander
give me ten seconds im telling you ive got it
thats it times up
it sure is
now mister mayweather
the network is being destroyed
looks like were getting out of this soup faster than we thought
without the spheres their transformed space must be collapsing in on itself
which one hoshi
number four the fourth one from the left
are you sure
yes yes number five is the last one after you disable the reactor
but if we knock the reactor out wont that be enough
we didnt come here to disable this weapon were here to destroy it give me the charges
ill take care of it sir
i want the four of you to get to the outer framework beam back to degras ship
as chief tactical officer sir
this isnt open for debate lieutenant
dont worry ill be right behind you
what have you done
one reptilian transported to the weapon
lets make sure he has nowhere to go back to they have no shielding on their starboard engines target all weapons
can you get a lock on him
not yet
your captain is too deep within the weapon
acting captains starlog february 14th 2152 were holding position at the coordinates where we were told to meet degras vessel so far theres been no word from them
long range sensors are detecting no evidence of the spheres
none of them
none and all the spatial anomalies within our scanning range have vanished
what about the thermobaric cloud barrier
i can only detect a small section from our location but it appears to be dissipating
looks like we kept our end of the bargain
it would appear that the expanse is returning to normal space
we should have heard something by now what if they failed earth could be
be patient
my skins healing faster than yours i guess you vulcans arent so tough after all
doctor phlox says we should all be back to normal within two to three days
im only kidding you look nice like this kind of like an old oil painting
im not old i will only be sixty six years old on my next birthday
i cant believe you told me that
you accused me of looking old
thats not what i mean ive been trying to get you to tell me your age since we left spacedock why now
to vulcans certain information is considered intimate
intimate
bridge to tpol
go ahead
a vortex just opened its degras ship
this is enterprise please repeat
captain did you stop the weapon  captain
set an intercept course
its done
done
captain archer destroyed the weapon
where is he is he okay
captain didnt make it trip
what do you mean he didnt make it
the weapon exploded before he could transport to degras ship
come in  thank you
the aquatic vessel should have you home in less than a day
i was pleased to hear that the council has agreed to reconvene
it was difficult for the insectoids to ignore recent events
and the reptilians
theyll join us eventually they have no choice but to accept that the guardians promises were empty your captains sacrifice will not be forgotten safe journey
thank you
its all right all right it wont be much longer i promise
is something wrong
i think they sense that were travelling in an unusual manner in the belly of the beast so to speak
there are no windows here how would they know were inside the aquatic vessel
i dont have the slightest idea i doubt ill get much peace and quiet around here until were flying under our own power
it will only be a few more hours
is there something i can do for you
my skin hasnt fully healed yet
oh youre doing fine vulcans are obviously more sensitive to the effects of mysterious realms
i guess were not so tough after all
excuse me
is there anything ill need to treat this
only time hows morale
it isnt easy for a crew to lose its captain
i suppose well all need time to heal
will he be all right
after a while hes lost his best friend but its just a matter of time hell be fine again
did you hear that the doctor says youll be fine its just a matter of time
distance
eight hundred thousand kilometres
set a course ensign
you should be in your quarters
with all due respect to phlox i wouldnt miss this for the world
mind if we take a look
prettiest sight i ever saw its all in one piece
the captain would be proud
open a channel to starfleet headquarters
strange
what
theyre not responding
youd think theyd be waiting with bated breath
try another frequency
im not picking up the orbital platforms
the reptilians destroyed yosemite station
its not just yosemite theres nothing coming from any of them
ive rotated through all the frequencies
contact the lunar one colony
i already tried
prepare a shuttlepod i want you and ensign mayweather to get down to san francisco find out whats wrong
looks pretty normal to me
then why the hell doesnt anyone want to talk to us land at the pad behind the command centre
finally weve got three vessels approaching
its about time this is commander charles tucker of the starship enterprise you guys gave us quite a  what the hell
sir
where is he
follow me he was brought in yesterday hes been badly burned  do you recognise the uniform
this is commander charles tucker of the starship enterprise
what the hell are you people doing
those are p51s ive seen them at air shows
i dont think this is an air show
are they breaking off maybe we should follow them
try to find a landing port set us down
starboard injector
get us out of here
rita hayworth veronica lake betty grable americans are good at making movies theyre not so good at fighting some day i will go to hollywood and i will meet betty grable maybe you will introduce me huh what do you think
shes not your type
you know in hollywood movies americans always win too bad for you youre not in a movie
insurgents
keep driving move move
as to the youth of all the britons i say you cannot stop there is no haltingplace at this point we have now reached a point in the journey where there can be no pause we must go on it must be world anarchy or world order
that was winston churchill i picked that up half an hour ago
well its true then were over two hundred years in the past
ive also intercepted several military dispatches and their radio programme something called the shadow
we should run a complete diagnostic start with the sensor array
this isnt a damn sensor glitch we just pulled three fifty calibre bullets from the shuttlepod hull and spare us the official vulcan position about time travel we are two hundred years in the past face it
the first step to getting back is ascertaining how we got here as soon as the diagnostic is complete run a scan for any anomalies in the area
right away
maybe were here for a reason maybe this wasnt an accident
for the moment we cant rule out any possibilities
the germans believe there are five thousand resistance fighters operating throughout the region theyre becoming better organized increasing their attacks we lost four men in the assault
you should have chosen a safer route and you should have personally overseen the transfer
we were in the midst of a crucial weapons test he was just an american prisoner
he was more than that this communication device he was carrying its from the future
a temporal agent
double the security details at all the entrances to the compound if they have located us it wont be long before they strike
how could they have possibly found us
if the prisoner hadnt escaped we might know the answer to that question you know what i expect of you
the prisoner will be recovered
come in
you got a second i wanted to say i was way out of line earlier you have enough to worry about without me flying off the handle
your reaction was understandable
i was just all set to get home i wasnt expecting to be in the middle of another situation
none of us were i was also looking forward to going home i thought perhaps i would return to vulcan its been some time since i was there
sounds nice i was gonna lay on a different beach every week for two months the only thing to figure out was whether to start in tahiti or in cancun the captain would always try to put the best light on the worst situation i wonder what hed say to this one
i think hed be hardpressed to find any positive aspects but he would try nevertheless  come in
ive been going over those military dispatches that hoshi picked up some of them dont make sense they mention recent battles in virginia and ohio there werent any battles fought there in world war ii the nazis never got to north america somethings very wrong down there
its chicken liver your favourite with grated cheddar no i cant say i blame you i dont have much of an appetite myself perhaps a denobulan lullaby will improve your mood on the other hand my singing would often drive my children to tears maybe what you need is a nice thick steak ill see what chef has on the menu be right back
hey hey its okay its all right im a friend just cleaning you up a little wars a dirty business but youre lucky bullet just missed the bone
where am i
youre in my apartment whats left of it im alicia travers
jonathan archer
pleased to meet you whats the last thing you remember
i was in a truck with a couple of german soldiers there was an explosion someone started shooting at us i got away
you sure did and your ss friends theyre dead which is how i like them youre my first bona fide pow i usually fix up guys in the resistance  easy easy easy easy sailor you dont want to start bleeding again
sailor
that patch on your shirt says enterprise you must have made it off before it sank howd you wind up all the way over here
ive been asking myself the same question  what year is this
its 1944
world war two
i havent heard it called that before but thats as good a description as any used to be a pretty nice neighbourhood even for coloureds as you can see its gone downhill
where are we
we in brooklyn new york city
the weapon fires a modulating plasma pulse equivalent to the energy produced by three eighty eight millimetre shells each pulse can destroy a tank
very impressive when can we expect deployment
i cant give you a specific timetable there are still some problems to be addressed
such as
portability the weapons require considerable power in my century there are energy cells the size of a coin in this century its somewhat more difficult
what are these
requisition forms i require additional supplies
eighty six metric tons of aluminum plating a hundred and seventy tons of carbon steel we cant keep diverting vital materials from war production
we are inside the home of a former american president it seems to me your war effort is going well enough
that could change very quickly intelligence suggests the americans are preparing a counterattack our front lines are dangerously thin supply routes are under constant attack from resistance fighters a forceful enemy thrust could stand a good chance of breaking through on top of this thereve been setbacks in africa and the russians are attempting to retake moscow though no one has expressed this to the fuhrer there is widespread belief that germany has advanced too far too quickly
all the more reason to accede to my request the weapons im preparing will make you immune from any counterattack anywhere in the world and im not just referring to plasma rifles imagine a plague targeting nonaryans no need for extermination camps just a few grams of a pathogen introduced into the water supply
you make promises all we ever see are films
theres far too much at stake for us to argue we have far too much in common we both embrace the ideals of purity and perfection and we both face enemies that would destroy us now is not the time to end an association that is vital to our mutual survival
no one has proposed ending anything
then ill expect delivery by the end of the week
portions of daniels body have aged at a dramatic rate in some areas the tissue is over a hundred years old yet other sections have been reduced to an almost foetal stage
do you have any theories as to what caused this
its not any kind of infectious organism at least nothing that shows up on my medical scanner
will he survive
frankly with his amount of cellular chaos im surprised hes still alive i doubt hell live more than 24 hours
he very well could be responsible for our being here he could also be the only hope of getting back to our own time it is imperative that i speak with him
vics been arrested
when
a few hours ago
the gestapos clearing out entire buildings shooting people on the street theyre looking for you the germans are offering ten thousand dollars for information leading to your capture why
cant tell you
look you son of a bitch my friend is probably being tortured right now i want to know why
its classified
i wont tell anyone
sal
shut up you got three seconds one two three
come on sal take it easy take it easy come on now easy easy
all i can tell you is were on the same side
damn military you cut and run you leave us at the mercy of these nazi bastards
i didnt cut and run
oh yeah yeah i forgot it was an orderly retreat
vic might break if he talks it wont be safe here
weve been through this
alicia
this is my home im not leaving
were going to see if we can find out any more information about vic
hes conscious but i dont know for how long
wheres captain archer
captain archer is dead he was on the xindi weapon when it exploded are you responsible for sending us back in time  why
the temporal cold war has become an allout conflict temporal agents dozens of them stationed throughout the timeline theyve been given orders to change history
for what purpose
each faction is trying to wipe the others out its a fight for dominance
daniels the events of this period dont correspond with recorded history germany has launched a successful invasion of the united states
different incursions are causing paradoxes turbulence in the time stream i almost didnt make it back
how do we return to our century
you cant it doesnt exist not the way you know it neither does mine its all gone you have to stop him
stop who daniels stop who
were conducting extensive sweeps within a fifteen mile radius of the ambush we havent found the prisoner but we have taken in several members of the resistance theyre being interrogated theres one that i suspect took part in the ambush
were picking up scans from a ship in orbit its from the same time period as the device we found on the escaped prisoner this resistance member youre interrogating
yes
bring him to me
not bad
where is your husband now
hes in the pacific on a destroyer i hear the war isnt going any better over there dont be expecting a second course
its not bad
youre a rotten liar all the good stuff goes to the germans i still cant believe it you know that theyre actually here ill never forget the day i saw that first german tank rolling up flatbush all the people streaming across the brooklyn bridge trying to get out of manhattan the president on the radio vowing to persevere right before the government evacuated washington  right on time
my old flame
billie holiday
good to know theres something that your remember
i cant even think of his name
germans outlawed coloured music some of the neighbours pass a phonograph from house to house every night so the germans cant find it just another way of telling em off
for i havent met a gent so magnificent
alicia im going to ask you something its going to sound a little strange
what else is new
ive met so many men some who sent me up to the skies
when i was in a german medical tent one of the soldiers who came in to see me wasnt like the other ones he had grey skin red eyes he wasnt human this isnt the first time youve heard something like this
sal mentioned some stories once but i didnt believe them
they may be more than stories i need to track down this soldier i saw its very important would you contact sal
eps conduits fried get to engineering and pull a fresh one out of the injector assembly
yes commander
walsh
commander
silik you son of a bitch
climb in
you brought us here
no
then who did
whats happening is beyond your comprehension get in the shuttlepod i would rather not have to discharge this weapon
bay one is depressurising someones launching a shuttlepod
hail them
im picking up one life sign aboard its suliban
phasecannons
if this nazi wasnt a human what was he then
i dont know
just tell sal i want to talk to him
all right
here its hamburger germans are cutting the meat ration again its gonna be worth its weight in gold
thanks carmine
watch yourselves
used to be wed get meat on wednesdays and fridays then it was just wednesdays
nazis blame the resistance say were disrupting the food shipment
makes the germans feel like heroes
yeah
fighting to feed the people
look
no eye contact
why do you walk with her
why not
do you like negroes
we dont want any trouble
shut up bitch do we make you angry
you could say that
when we send her back to africa you can go along you can run through the jungles together
like i said neighbourhoods gone downhill
before he lost consciousness daniels told me there was someone we had to stop
at least now we know who he was talking about
can you get a fix on the shuttlepod
he disabled the transponder however we are picking up trace plasma signatures probably from the damage i think i can get us within three kilometres of where it went down
that will have to suffice
thing i cant understand whyd he go to the trouble of saving my life he pulled me out of the launch bay before he depressurised it
another item on our list of things to ponder
curfew starts in an hour we got to move fast
yeah sometimes the germans dont wait for curfew
cant get used to all this skulking around
i know what you mean we used to own this neighbourhood
yeah tell him what you guys did before the war
nothing to tell we were delegates for the construction workers union
right the loansharkinq was just a parttime job
we helped people get out of financial difficulty since when is that a crime
when they didnt pay you back on time thats where the crime part came in
come on lets go
this guys a welsher and a drunk i wouldnt put too much stock into what comes out of his mouth
ill keep that in mind
im only doing this because alicia asked dont forget that
whats this all about
i want you to tell him what you told me about your customer
who are you
just shut up and tell him
i cant talk and shut up at the same time
talk
the man comes to me for information sometimes he asks about the resistance sometimes he asks about the gestapo hes keeping tabs on both sides me i dont know squat so i make stuff up he pays good
whats he look like
he always wears a hat stays in the shadows i caught a glimpse of him once he aint like nobody i ever seen thats for sure its the red eyes i cant forget
i want to talk to him
forget it that aint part of the deal
sal
what you owe me take twenty percent off
damn sal
what im a generous guy
i dont know
hey you think the germans are tough get me in a bad mood
artillery
hard to believe were only a few kilometres from new york city
its hard to believe this is earth
plasma signature that way
could be the last cuban in the city
no thanks
you dont know what youre missing
i got a pretty good idea
i read in a magazine once the germans were doing medical experiments on people well maybe thats what you saw one of their experiments
i hadnt considered it
a lot of weird stories floating around the germans working on new weapons guns that shoot light instead of bullets turn people into dust it all sounds like one of those stories that guy orson welles dreamed up
rat orson welles war of the worlds my engineer played it for me once
howd he do that
a friend at a radio station made a recording
you know all those people who panicked i was one of them i fell for the whole thing i called my sister in jersey i told her the martians were coming she broker her ankle racing for the car it cost me a fortune in medical bills sometimes i wish the martians had come
im sure you would have given them a run for their money
were keeping the germans busy more and more of us every day irish gangs dockworkers coloureds even broads some of these women they can shoot the fleas off a tick when the wars over i got half a mind to put them on the payroll
here  its loaded
you
throw the gun down
youre not following directions thats how people get hurt
youd better take her advice
what do you want
holy mother of
tucker to enterprise
tpol
we found it
no sign of silik
whats the shuttlepods condition
ill need some more time before ill know if itll fly
you ever see anything like that before
maybe hes wearing some kind of mask
thats no mask
who are you answer me
i have nothing to say to you
how about if we pulled out your tongue
youre not what i expected temporal agents are usually more informed
what in the hell is a temporal agent
you wouldnt understand
listen you freak
why are you changing history youre helping the germans win the war why
because it suits us
how does this suit you
sal no damn it
its better than he deserves
get your hands off him
you want answers dont you
not like that
just say the word sal ill take him out right here
the hell with it
i dont know how long i can hold them off you better talk to me now who are you what are you doing here
were trapped the germans are helping us construct a conduit so we can find our way home
you said i was a temporal agent
we know youre from the future we detected your ship in orbit
my ship
it has the same markings that were on your uniform
i need to contact them can i do it with this
we better get out of here
the conduit wheres it being built
you find it
come on come on
you wont stop us when we get back youll never have existed
eps systems completely fused it could take a week
im picking up movement in the area looks like several vehicles
commander
i heard moving to plan b what about silik
we gotta find him
we will one problem at a time
jesus he looked like some kind of demon
his blood wasnt even red
was that my imagination or did he say something about being from the future
he meant him
archer to enterprise
you want any more of our help youre gonna tell us whats going on what was that back there
that was an extraterrestrial
a martian
i dont know what planet he was from
well where are you from
upstate new york
fellas a lot of people out past curfew
i dont like the looks of this
we gotta get out of here
move
sal  get out of here
enterprise come in enterprise
what are you doing
enterprise
whoever youre calling theyre not going to get here in time
charges are set
its done
ive lost them
the explosion may have disrupted their comm signal
im picking up another signal its faint
lets hear it
captain archer to enterprise come in enterprise come in
captain
your transmission is very weak do you read me
tpol two to transport
leave your weapons on the ground and stand up slowly
we have a great deal to talk about
itll have to wait
youre all right youre on my ship
how did we get here
its kind of complicated
promise you wont do that again
i promise
captain
welcome home
were not quite home yet but its good to be back i guess i have some catching up to do status
several vehicles converged on the area moments before the shuttlepod exploded
keep searching this is one of the aliens communicators take it apart figure out how to monitor their transmissions
its nice to see you again captain
i hope its the last time youll have to look after porthos
it was a pleasure as always
is he awake
he doesnt have much time
jonathan
who are they
the most dangerous faction of the cold war theyre led by vosk a fanatic violently opposed to the temporal accords
stay with me stay with me
we almost captured him but he developed a form of stealth time travel he escaped into the past we eventually located him but it was too late he returned to my century he and his people defeated us and launched this war thats destroying all of time ive sent you to this point because its here that vosk can be stopped if you succeed the war will never happen the timeline will be restored
one of his people told me they were building a conduit
vosks time travel device had a drawback it was a oneway trip he needed to construct the conduit to get home but he was forced to use technology from this time period the machine would have to be enormous find it destroy it he must not succeed stop him
your colleague has managed to evade us i assure you whatever i want to know youll tell me gratefully  ill be supervising another test notify me when theyre ready for questioning
we just pulled three fifty calibre bullets from the shuttlepod hull we are two hundred years in the past
insurgents
your colleague has managed to evade us i assure you whatever i want to know youll tell me
where are we
we in brooklyn
the weapons im preparing will make you immune from any counterattack anywhere in the world
the germans were offering ten thousand dollars for information leading to your capture why
all i can tell you is were on the same side
holy mother of
were trapped the germans are helping us construct a conduit so we can find our way home
ive sent you to this point because its here that vosk can be stopped if you succeed the timeline will be restored
one of these people told me they were building a conduit
find it destroy it he must not succeed stop him
and now the conclusion
news on parade america and germany together in the fight for freedom in his first visit to the home of the brave the german chancellor received a warm welcome from the big apple he greeted enthusiastic crowds in times square and took in the view from the top of the empire state building watch that first step later the fuhrer paid a call to lady liberty where he was given the keys to the city the whirlwind tour was capped off by a fourhour speech to city leaders where the fuhrer outlined his vision for a prosperous alliance between germany and america vowing to root out the parasitic elements that have crippled our economy since 1929 and to liberate the masses from the grip of financial profiteers together we will put americans back to work two great nations marching side by side toward a bold future
our intelligence sources are convinced that the american counterattack will be launched within days its no longer a rumour its fact
i assume youre taking the necessary steps
what is that
an intelligence briefing according to this your squadron performed flawlessly in recent field tests
youve been spying on us
were protecting our interests
i suppose i wouldve done the same tell your fuhrer hell receive the squadron when i deem it ready for deployment
this says it is ready for deployment
with all due respect your intelligence is flawed
we are tired of your stalling
and i am tired of your threats
you and your men have taken an oath to defend germany
we take that oath seriously
do you
youve made certain promises to me as well
weve provided everything youve asked for youll not receive a single truckload of additional supplies till you fulfill your part of the agreement
general you might consider what would happen if my weapons were to fall into the hands of the allies imagine berlin obliterated by plasma cannons
i should have you arrested for treason
you are a fool you think were equals because i allow you to participate in this struggle you fight to control nations we dominate entire worlds we extend our will across time if your race were to endure for a million years you couldnt begin to approach what weve accomplished the next time you feel the urge to threaten me remember this i can erase you from history as if you never existed
she was around my age
twenty six
ensign omalley howd she die
in a battle with a hostile species
theres still war in the future
on earth between human beings war has been eliminated but the galaxys a big place with thousands of species not all of them have the same values we have
spaceships people from other planets people from the future its all a little too much for alicia travers from bensonhurst besides im afraid of heights
i can send you anywhere in the world to a place that isnt occupied by the germans
seem to be fewer and fewer of those places every day i want to go home to my neighbourhood there are a lot of people in trouble down there and im not going to just turn my back on them but you knew i was going to say that didnt you
i had a feeling two of my men are missing they could be hiding out they mightve been taken prisoner they could be dead
weve got eyes on every street corner i can i can put a word out archer with this ship with all this power you can help us you can help us stop those bastards
i know
then do it start with berlin wipe that damn place off the map and dont stop until you kill every last one of them because what they
were going to stop them thats one of the reasons were here but were going to do it another way
okay i guess you know what youre doing are you going to start by sending me down with that dissolver thing
shuttlepods are damaged the transporter is all we have
archer you promised me i wouldnt have to go through that again
im going to have to break that promise
okay how does that thing work anyway on second thought id rather not know
begin the test sequence
based on the interrogations i believe the prisoners are not temporal agents
ive arrived at the same conclusion their technology suggests theyre from a period too early for time travel
they dont even seem to know how they got to this century its curious
still i refuse to believe their presence here is an accident
theres a power surge in one of the power modules
run a complete systems scan isolate the fault our time is running out the germans are becoming impatient
why not give them what they want
i dont trust these people i never have im not about to furnish them with weapons that could be used against us return the prisoners to their holding cell see that they get medical attention go
bring the doctor immediately
i think ive pinpointed where the timeline changed someone assassinated lenin in 1916
who took his place
no one so without lenin the bolsheviks never gained power russia didnt become communist and germany never considered it a threat
hitler was able to concentrate on the west
after france belgium and the netherlands fell hitler quickly took england and then the eastern united states
but vosk and his men arrived on earth recently a few years ago
then they couldnt have been responsible for the changes that took place in 1916
the police never captured lenins assassin some bystanders claimed that the killer vanished into thin air
daniels said that different factions in the temporal war are changing history throughout the timeline maybe this assassin was working for one of them
but i thought we were here to prevent vosk from starting the temporal war
chicken or the egg
bridge to captain archer
go ahead
im receiving a transmission its vosk
this is captain archer
your voice sounds familiar captain have we met
what do you want
i believe i have two of your men
are they all right
i think it would be mutually beneficial to discuss this face to face
we can bring you aboard
i was thinking of a more neutral location theres a remote area outside the city
thats not what id consider neutral
you have scanners
examine the area before coming down ill have three men with me and your crewmen
a few hours ago you tried to kill me
the situation has changed
im sending you the coordinates if youre interested meet me in one hour
got em
its good to see you again captain
where are my men
captain i dont believe it how can you be
are you all right
we werent exactly treated like royalty
i apologise for the aggressiveness of our questioning
aggressive
we were operating under a false impression
were okay
get back to the ship
wait a minute youre coming with us
trip  beam them up
you have your men captain now its your turn to reciprocate
how
i wish to discuss something with you
go on
a species with your level of technology doesnt possess the capability for time travel
we had a little help
as i suspected what do you know about me
i know that youre trapped here and that youre trying to get back to the twenty ninth century i also know youve made a deal with the germans theyre giving you supplies helping you build a time machine
i see i was both right and wrong about you youre not a temporal agent but youre here to do their bidding
if you carry out your mission if you make it back to the twenty ninth century you will ignite a war that will devastate the timeline
youve only heard one side of the story captain the temporal agents who sent you here are a tyrannical sect imposing their will on countless cultures throughout history
they manipulate the time line to serve their own needs if youve ever dealt with them then you know they do much more than watch history unfold they interfere with events they have an agenda
so do you
at least i dont hide my intentions its true i dont agree with the temporal accords i believe that time travel is a technology no different than your warp drive to be utilized for the benefit of all species societies cultures can be improved through careful manipulation of historical events
who decides what improvements are needed
i wont be drawn into a philosophical discussion theres one simple reason why you should help me captain
and whats that
i can send you back to your century
historys been changed the century i left will be completely different
once ive defeated the temporal agents ill reverse the damage done to your timeline your history will return to the way it was im severely limited by twentieth century earth technology the resources aboard your ship will greatly accelerate my task go back reunite with your crewmen and consider what i have said
how are they doing
a few cuts and bruises
what happened after we beamed up you make some kind of deal
he thinks were considering it
are we
captain
whatd you see down there
we were in some huge building like a factory theyre constructing something big the germans are helping him
i overheard them talking they mentioned something about a temporal conduit i know it sounds crazy but i think its a time machine
daniels sent us here to stop them from completing it problem is its protected by some kind of energy shield
who dressed this
nicky giorgio what do you want hes a mechanic
he should stick to cars at least it doesnt look infected
could have been worse could have ended up like sal
its a miracle you got away
guess you should know
whats that supposed to mean
i heard a rumour when the soldiers cornered you and archer you two disappeared into thin air like ghosts
thats crazy
thats what i said but then again i didnt believe in nazi martians you know not until i saw one myself
want to tell me what this is
you went through my jacket
i was looking for a cigarette what is it
its a radio
i never seen a radio like this it looks like that thing archer took off that martian guy or whatever he was
archer gave this to me so that i could talk to him
talk to him where is he alicia youve been like a little sister to us youre going to start keeping secrets now
wheres my engineer silik this disk you were carrying it contains schematics of vosks facility this is what you came here for isnt it
you persist in asking questions you know i will not answer
ill try answering them myself then your benefactor wants to do more than just project his image into the past he wants the technology to travel into the past somehow he found out that daniels was sending enterprise here so you were ordered to hitch a ride your mission was to break into vosks compound and steal this
tell me how was i planning to send that to the future
maybe thats why you came back aboard maybe you need enterprise
an impressive display captain
im glad youre not disappointed
though im not implying youre correct in any of your assumptions
of course not
but you dont have the answer youre seeking the whereabouts of your missing crewman
i think you left him somewhere inside vosks compound and for your sake hed better be alive
youve changed captain
and not at all for the better
a large amount of data has been stolen from our computer system captain
we found trace amounts of bioresidue the thief is from your time period
hes suliban hes aboard my ship hes a stowaway
weve encountered his faction before i want to speak with him
i cant allow that
and i suppose you arent examining the technology he stole from us
i reserve that right
and i reserve the right to destroy you
i have a plasmacannon aimed at your ship captain
and i have phasecannons aimed at your facility
i want an answer to my proposal
the answer is no
return fire
their shields are still holding
travis
theyre moving out of range
we needed them
well complete our objective with the resources at hand resume your work
engines took a serious hit weapons are down
get to work on repairs  keep looking over those schematics find a way to disable the shields protecting that compound
im getting my crewman back youre going to help me get inside the facility
and then are you going to destroy it
yes
i dont care about your crewman captain but i dont want vosk to succeed any more than you do ill help you there is one problem i use my genetic enhancements to get inside the building your presence will negate that advantage
well work around it
you should be able to deactivate the shields from this console heres the procedure the data from the disk was extremely helpful
youre welcome
when the shields are down give us ten minutes then destroy the facility
our targeting array is offline were in need of commander tuckers skills
do what you can move in close and fire pointblank if you have to
understood good luck
three american divisions have crossed the ohio river two more are advancing from the south toward washington by direct order from the fuhrer the squadron is to be transferred immediately to luftwaffe regional command i am to personally oversee the deployment
weapons of this complexity require extensive training to operate
well discuss the particulars once youve fulfilled your obligation
six hours
why the delay
the planes must be readied for transport
six hours
were leaving tonight begin preparations
each time we open a conduit it collapses within seconds
human leaders often speak of destiny the conduit will hold
how do i look better from my dealings with you and your crew id come to believe that your race was inherently unaggressive
weve come a long way in a short time
one thing is clear when necessary humans are fully capable of reverting to old methods the way you handled that xindi threat was extremely effective no doubt its the reason why daniels chose you to stop vosk
speaking of vosk seems to me that you both have a common enemy daniels why hadnt you decided to work together
one doesnt join forces with vosk
hes found some partners here
theyre only a means to an end to him and his followers other species exist only to serve their needs
sounds like you and vosk have some history
his faction once tried to eradicate the suliban they travelled into our past altered it to prevent our species from attaining sentience
then how is it that youre here
he was stopped by the temporal agents
are you saying you owe daniels people your lives
they still oppose us theyre still our enemy that will never change
what the hell do you want
im looking for alicia travers
whos asking
my names archer
still hunting martians
you just missed billie holiday
what are we going after this time the loch ness monster
im picking up a surge of radio chatter orders coming in german and english
theres heavy bombing most of it in eastern pennsylvania and southern virginia it could be an allied attack
could it pose a danger to the captain
the closest fighting is a hundred kilometres south of new york city incredible
whats our repair status
engines are at thirty six percent manoeuvring thrusters are offline
weapons
the targeting arrays fried well be shooting in the dark
whats so important about this facility
theyre building weapons there extremely powerful weapons
what i hear you have some pretty powerful weapons yourself i made her tell me everything not that i believe all of it
do we really need these people
what do you mean these people
i dont see how they can be of any use to us
ill tell you how i can be of use to you how about i start removing your teeth with my knuckles
all right
are you threatening me
hey give the man a prize
why would you do that
im going to kill this guy
hey i havent signed off on this yet sal went along with you and look what it got him if im gonna lose any more people thered better be a good reason
look you know what carmine im gonna make this real easy for you im gonna help him all you have to do is decide whether or not youre gonna help me
our greatest scientist once said every moment we live we are moving through time weve earned the right to chose which direction the mastery of time has allowed us to perfect ourselves to reach our full potential as a people and to vanquish those who oppose us theres just one last enemy to deal with soon history will belong to us we will stretch out our hands and mold it according to our will not even the gods of our ancestors could have imagined such power my brothers we are going home
what a way to spend a saturday night
it only opens from the inside
theres too many of em come on
its nice to see you
insurgents we dont know how many
a fortuitous development let the germans deal with them continue with the preparations
were in were making our way to the console
our targeting array is still down
were going to have to drop out of orbit to get close enough
understood
have you located commander tucker
not yet its second on my list believe me
take cover
theyre activating the conduit work fast captain
he did it
take us in
aye
were in an extremely precarious position
i hadnt noticed
it might help if i had a weapon
sorry only one to go around
silik
the earth ship has entered the atmosphere
activate the plasma weapon
we cant spare the power
then deploy the squadron destroy them
no the squadrons going to the front
execute my order
i am taking command of this facility you are relieved
im sorry general but im afraid i have to end our alliance
archer to enterprise archer to enterprise
theyre in the atmosphere ionisation the signal cant penetrate
well get you out of here
i think not youve proven a worthy opponent captain i wouldve preferred to die fighting you but i suppose i can settle for this
trip
hold it right there
its me
shut up drop the disguise silik or ill blow your ugly head off
if you do youll probably regret it
captain
good to see you commander
youre alive
as long as you dont pull that trigger
i cant believe it
the buildings about to blow up
gotcha
this way
distance
one hundred kilometres targeting scanner still cant get a lock im going to have to do this the oldfashioned way switching to visual scanners
slow us down two hundred kph
nicky cover them
you got to pull your people out
oh im having too much fun
in a few seconds this entire area is going to be bombed
planes start falling back we got to get the hell out of here
i guess we have to say goodbye all over again its harder the second time
i cant argue with that
i want my neighbourhood back the way it was and my husband i want him home fix all that okay
ill try thank you
yeah
hey youre welcome
german divebombers stukas nothing too much to worry about however they were fitted with sirens to frighten the enemy during an attack they fire seven point nine millimetre rounds
mister reed
were too far away i still cant see it
it appears that bullets and sirens arent all they have
photonic torpedoes
its holding
im reading a powerful energy surge inside the facility
malcolm
one more kilometre
destiny
i can see it
take it out
no
its quite a sight the timelines resetting itself you did it vosk is dead he didnt make it back all of the damage he caused it never happened
and youre here to give me a pat on the back
in a way
well i dont want it i want you to leave me and my crew alone were done with you and your damn temporal cold war
its coming to an end because of what you did you have no idea how many lives youve saved
ill take your word for it just send us home
its almost ready goodbye jonathan captain its been a privilege
everyone all right
captain
were in the right place lets find out if were in the right time hoshi
multiple signals lunar one colony orbital platform san francisco theyre all calling in
im picking up vessels approaching dozens of them
do they look friendly
well done jonathan
thank you admiral
ive been told that people are calling us heroes when it comes to my crew you wont get any argument from me but i think its important that we remember the heroes who arent with us the twenty seven crewmen who didnt make it back without their sacrifice i wouldnt be standing here right now none of us would but im sure i speak on behalf of my entire crew when i say its good to be home
excuse me
scotch
the bars reserved for regular customers galactic heroes have to sit at a table
i heard about your promotion congratulations captain
thank you
cheers
cheers so what was it like in the expanse
youll be at the debriefing tomorrow wont you i wouldnt want to spoil any surprises besides ive got more important questions seen any good movies while i was gone
another world war iii epic it swept all the awards but you havent missed much earths been holding its breath for the past year wondering if the xindi were going to come back and finish the job on the bright side thereve been more weddings and births than ever before
i dont see a ring
im married to starfleet just like you
come in
well it looks like youre taking enough clothes to last a year
you wanted something
i told the captain i wanted to stay aboard and supervise the refit but he suggested i take a break more like an order actually problem is im not sure where to go lizzies gone my home town doesnt exist anymore guess this is my home now
you could come with me
to vulcan
the transport leaves at eleven hundred hours
where would i stay
theres a guest room in my mothers home
oh your moms house huh what does she know about me about us
ive never mentioned you
so youd introduce me as
commander charles tucker the third youve told the captain that you dont get to see as many alien cultures as youd like youve never been to vulcan
eleven hundred hours huh id better start packing
weve tied these stations directly in the primary eps junction
i hope you dont mind if i steal some of these improvements
i wont say anything if you do me a small favour my senior officer candidates id like to get your opinion youve served with a few of them
you might want to talk to someone about installing a lumbar support youre going to spend a lot of hours in that chair
weve improved hull polarisation by twelve percent well be able to hang in a firefight a little longer
ventral and dorsal torpedo launchers pulsed phase cannons
upgrades you recommended what is it
i had an argument once with captain jefferies he was one of the designers of the nxclass
im aware of that
i told him i didnt want to be in command of a warship trying to make first contact with new species jefferies was right we needed those weapons and a hell of a lot more
the asteroids were loaded with trellium ore we think the vulcans entered the field in order to mine it
trellium
its an alloy that protects against spatial anomalies ships in the expanse used it to insulate their hulls
your log reflects that when you boarded the seleya you found the crew in a delusional violent state
they attacked us the minute we docked the trellium had a toxic effect on the vulcans it damaged their neural pathways they lost the ability to suppress their emotions
according to your log the entire crew of the seleya was killed when you triggered a reactor breach
the breach was an accident we were trying to disable their power grid
as far as i can determine you didnt try to save a single vulcan crewman
there was no point they were too far gone
is that your medical opinion captain
phlox made that determination
our specialists have examined the data you sent back its far from certain that the neurological damage was irreversible
there was nothing we could do for them
tpol was exposed to the trellium she recovered
i couldnt help them
theres no need to get emotional captain you spent several hours in the ships auxiliary control room in that time did you try to access the internal sensors or download the computer database
no
so in effect we dont know what really happened aboard the seleya
what the hell does that mean
because of this oversight well never have a complete picture of the events that led to the ships destruction
i just told you exactly what led to the ships destruction
captain
im not going to sit here and be accused of murdering those people
no one is accusing you of anything captain
maybe that crew would still be alive if youd been a little more helpful
i beg your pardon
you did everything you could to sabotage our mission i got more help from the andorians than i ever got from the high command
thats enough captain
this planet would be a cloud of dust right now if wed listened to you
thats enough
how can you be taking his side
i am not taking anyones side you were out of line
they dont lift a finger to help us and now i have to justify myself to that son of a bitch
the debriefings on hold indefinitely i want you to take some time off to clear your head
with all due respect admiral i dont need a vacation
thats an order captain
lieutenant if you wouldnt mind
not exactly travelling light are you
thank you why leave the comforts of home when you can take it all with you
okay i trust youll be taking the proper precautions on the surface
what do you mean
im surprised you havent heard an andorian and two rigelians were attacked
attacked why
apparently the xindi incident has caused a degree of xenophobia its hard to believe in this day and age im told the vulcans are staying behind the walls of their compound
well im not going to let a few isolated incidents disrupt my vacation plans i lived on earth for many years before coming aboard enterprise
i dont think this is the same planet you remember doctor people are looking for someone to blame and they dont care who it is
i appreciate your concern but ill be fine would you
thank you
mind if i ask what youre doing here
you know better than to go climbing without a partner
what about that volcano we saw on the way down mount tarana
tarhana
it still active
there are frequent eruptions we can schedule a tour of the crater if youre interested
volcanoes ancient ruins fire plains im not sure where to start so this is where you grew up its not like i imagined
meaning
well its beautiful
vulcans appreciate beauty
well i had no doubt about that you always were a snazzy dresser
commander tucker i suggest
you didnt tell me you were bringing a guest
mother youre home
obviously its agreeable to see you you appear well
im charles tucker pleased to meet you maam
why is he here
commander tucker is my colleague he wanted to visit vulcan
this is the first time youve brought a colleague home with you
you both must be very tired after your journey
the guest room is on the south end of the house
its not yet midday why arent you at the science academy
im no longer an instructor there i wrote you a letter didnt starfleet transmit it to your ship
we had communication difficulties in the expanse
i dont know why youre surprised this was planned years ago theres more to life than ones profession perhaps youll learn that one day it seems that im not the only one who knew you were coming you received this yesterday
its from koss
did you believe he had forgotten you youre going to respond
i have nothing to say to koss
hes your fiancé
former fiancé
that is a matter for debate it would be wise for you to speak with him
you probably dont want to hear this but i got a call from my brother yesterday they renamed my old high school after you how many is that two three dozen
im not counting
thats just north america i dont think zefram cochrane has that many schools named after him
so did you get a chance to look em over
look what over
my senior officer candidates any suggestions for tactical
you may want to find someone with more field experience a maco
im not sure how i feel about a military officer on the bridge
if i were you id talk to general casey about assigning an entire squad
things have changed since enterprise left spacedock youll spend a lot of your time boldly going into battle
dont you think youre being a little cynical
did you read my reports
yes captain i did
hey
mountain lion tracks are a few days old
good thing i have you to protect me
come in
good morning
what time is it
oh four hundred
youre kidding
we have to prepare the morning meal as guests its expected of us
the narru vines have bloomed early this year
ive had ample time to attend to them
it sounds as if youre not enjoying retirement
you still havent told me the reason for your visit
i didnt know one was necessary
i thought perhaps youd decided to rejoin the high command
ive been offered a commission with starfleet if i accept it could be several years before im able to return home
the gespar isnt fresh my stasis unit needs to be replaced
well id be happy to take a look at it if i can recalibrate a warp reactor i ought to be able to handle a kitchen appliance
my daughters always been fascinated by alien worlds she was all too eager to finish her schooling and leave vulcan
as i recall you encouraged me to leave
a mother is expected to push her young out of the nest at some point theyre supposed to return im told that on earth a human child chooses their own path in life they put their own wishes ahead of their familys
thats true for the most part
youve learned much from them havent you
a starfleet posting is no less important than one with the high command im sure father would have approved
your father believed that our work should enrich vulcan society
earth is supposed to be our ally
whats happened to you
we shouldnt argue in front of a guest
well thank you thats very kind of you to say unfortunately we cant actually give tours of the ship if that policy ever changes you two will be the first to know
you had to wear that jacket
do you think i wore this jacket to attract attention
hows your drink
delicious thank you
because id heard someplace your people didnt like alcohol
you may be thinking of vulcans
you know youre right i get your species mixed up all the time
is there something we can help you with
im just trying to make sure your friend here is comfortable sitting in a bar full of so many strange looking aliens like us
im quite comfortable
because if you werent if humans make you nervous for some reason the vulcan consulates on the other side of the bridge ill bet theres someplace there where someone like yourself could get a nice refreshing beverage
 well perhaps we should be on our way
were not going anywhere doctor
if your friend wants to go you should let him go
youre not chasing anyone out of here
you starfleet people are the real problem you fly all around space telling every species you meet where to find earth did it ever occur to you that might not be the smartest thing to do
sir why dont you just go back to the bar
excuse me admiral i dont take orders from you
you heard him step away from the table
gentlemen please
doctor
i just want to thank you for letting me stay here
expressing gratitude is an earth custom
tpol says thank you all the time
ive noticed
tpols lucky its nice to have a place to go home to
i know that you are romantically involved with my daughter theres no logic in denying it how long have you been attracted to her
i knew we had some kind of chemistry the first time we got into an argument i never had fun arguing with anyone before i got the impression tpol wasnt going to say anything to you
she didnt im her mother youve repaired it
the field generator just needed a little adjustment as good as new
if you have the time perhaps you could repair my food synthesiser
would you mind
koss
i need to speak with tpol
i want to hear about your life aboard the human ship you must have many fascinating stories
why are you here
the answer should be obvious
youve received my letters you know im not interested in marriage
the decision isnt ours alone my parents believe in the old traditions for them a betrothal cannot simply be dismissed
you have the option of choosing another mate
i dont want another mate
you should be aware ive been ill recently
ill
it could take some time for me to recover assuming its even possible
i can help my fathers a man of influence i knows the finest doctors in the province i intend to go through with this
what if i declare the kaliffee
is that what you want a fight to the death perhaps your human friend would make a suitable challenger
you find this amusing
no call a challenger if you wish ill do whatevers necessary
its best if you leave
i may be able to help your mother
what do you mean
my father could have her reinstated
she retired
she was asked to resign
why
ive said more than i should if we were to marry youd only have to live on vulcan for one year you could resume your career with starfleet after that
is that what you want an absent wife
id want you to be happy
you should go
how about that
what
just to the left of polaris we found our first mclass planet around that star
maybe humans will go back someday build a colony
i doubt it the air was filled with a psychotropic compound after breathing it for a few hours my senior officers nearly killed each other maybe the vulcans were right maybe we werent ready
not ready how long were we supposed to wait
look what its gotten us we almost lost earth
enterprise saved earth
if we werent out there stirring up trouble seven million people might still be alive
you werent stirring up trouble you were exploring
im not sure theres much of a difference
so what do you suggest put our starships in mothballs
no we need them but look at the vulcans theyre not explorers they keep their ships close to home you never know whos going to come calling
thats not the mission either one of us signed up for
well maybe youll feel differently after youve delivered a few dozen eulogies
its difficult to meditate with you standing there
this retirement wasnt your choice
thats not entirely accurate i chose to retire rather than face dismissal i was under investigation by the security ministry they claimed i had taken restricted data from the academy archives
did you
no
i dont understand
their accusations were fabricated i was told that if i left the academy they would end the inquiry
why would the ministry do this because of me they blamed me for the incident at pjem
after the monastery was destroyed the first minister was dismissed youve made many enemies here
they couldnt reach me on enterprise so they punished you its criminal how could you let them do this
youve changed your emotions were always close to the surface but you managed to suppress them its because of this commander tucker isnt it hes the reason why you refuse to bond with koss do you really believe that a human and a vulcan can have a future together imagine the shame your children would endure assuming that the two of you could have children
that wouldnt be your concern
you all right
im not even sure what all right means anymore
want to talk about it theres an old code among climbers anything that happens on the mountain stays there
you want to know why im out here i figured this is the last place id run into anyone whod want to shake my hand or take my picture or tell me im an inspiration to their children if they knew what id done
you did what any captain would have done
does that include torture or marooning a ship full of innocent people because i dont remember reading those chapters in the handbook
where are you going jon are you going to go climbing in the middle of the night
why not
itd be a shame if you lost your footing its a long way down but at least you wouldnt have to deal with these feelings anymore
are you telling me i have some kind of a death wish
you tell me
what was that
something i havent done in a while whatever you lost maybe i could help you find it
you know if we have time when we get back to earth id like to show you some sights return the favour everything okay
theres something i need to tell you ive decided to marry koss
marry him
if i join his family my mother will regain her position at the academy his father is a senior minister with a great deal of influence
i dont get it are they forcing you to do this
the decision was mine my mother resigned because of my actions
you told me three years ago you didnt even love this guy so youre just going to leave starfleet move back to vulcan
ive been negotiating with kosss family
negotiating
theyve agreed we wont have to reside together not right away ill remain on enterprise for the time being
thats real generous of them
trip i have to do this for many reasons
and how am i supposed to take this
im sorry
youre sorry you brought me sixteen light years just to watch you get married to someone you barely know
we should have brought a camera
you remember that planet i told you about there was a mountain range on the southern continent the view was almost as amazing as this
thats a good days climb weve got ahead of us we can reach the summit by nightfall but we should get moving
i think the view is fine from here im glad you tagged along
you know theres still something im not quite clear about
whats that
why did we stop seeing each other
well i was your superior officer it wasnt appropriate
youre not my superior anymore  i wonder if starfleet would approve the captains of the only two warp five ships
youre forgetting the climbers code
so whats the verdict am i going to live
your parasite count is almost negligible this should dispose of the rest of them
i hope youre going to make it tonight
hmm
madame changs dont tell me that you forgot
my osmotic eel is under the weather i should stay aboard until shes feeling better
wait no youve been talking about the eggdrop soup at this place for as long as ive known you
im sure you and ensign mayweather will enjoy it
i spoke with travis what happened to you the other night
oh you must mean the er  nothing more than an instinctive defensive response
so youre going to stay aboard the ship because of some loudmouth in a bar
my presence could provoke another incident someone could get hurt
this isnt the way to deal with prejudice the best thing is to show your face and remind people that there are aliens who dont want to blow up the planet
i cant blame those men for the way they reacted earth has survived a horrific attack it will take time for the trauma to heal besides i have friends to keep me company now if its not too much trouble
ill bring you some takeout
the details of this debriefing will remain classified as ordered by the command council
if there are no further questions
ambassador i want to apologise for what i said to you the other day i was out of line
yes you were
im glad we can finally agree on something
captain your actions while being morally questionable were necessary i opposed your appointment as captain of enterprise but its obvious now that i was wrong tpol has told me that the expanse would have someday encompassed hundreds of systems including vulcan youve done a great service for both our worlds
thank you
come in
koss and his family are waiting
ill be there as soon as i can know any good tailors
these clothes belonged to my husband they fit you well
arent you bothered by the fact that tpol doesnt even care for this guy
shes fulfilling her family obligation i met my husband only once before we were joined in time we developed a deep connection to each other
yeah well maybe shed rather make a connection with someone else
have you informed tpol
informed her of what
youre in love with her vulcans may not express their emotions but we are sensitive to them
i dont think i knew it until we were standing over that lava field and she told me she was going to marry koss thats when it hit me i was going to lose her i wanted to tell her right there but i couldnt
theres still time
i thought you didnt approve
i may not condone your relationship but its important for her to have all the facts
if i say anything tpol might call off the wedding or worse not call it off shes got enough pressure on her as it is i dont want to make things any more complicated
you look amazing
im grateful that youre here
wouldnt miss it for the world
its time
what ye are about to witness comes down from the time of the beginning without change this is the vulcan heart this is the vulcan soul this is our way
a transport shuttle no armaments
their engines are down life support failing
crew
two biosigns human
tractor beam send a squad to the docking port
move walk human
contact the high council inform them of the prisoners request instructions
commander disruptor fire near the brig
qiyah
you have a visitor
im busy
stand up doctor
arms
jonathan archer what brings you here theyre naming the prison after you
i need to ask you some questions
im kind of in the middle of something
it wont take long
well i suppose its not every day one gets to speak to the man who saved the planet please  i apologise for the clutter im not allowed traditional recording devices
you programmed a padd to unlock every security door in the building
i was particularly proud of that i made it all the way to sausalito on the rare occasion i get stuck on a problem i find a vigorous escape attempt helps to clear the head  go ahead theyre dna sequences that one is for a modification of the human tcell it would render sharat syndrome a thing of the past that one increases the visual spectrum by five percent of course none of this will ever be tested they clear out my room every few months im told it all gets vaporised
why invest so much time and energy on things no one will ever use
how can a supposedly intelligent species reject technology that would enhance ability relieve suffering
genetic engineering has caused a lot of suffering
so did splitting the atom yet the first ships to colonise the solar system were nuclearpowered but youre not here to discuss that
someone attacked a klingon bird of prey the entire crew was massacred the ship is missing
i read the reports i understand the klingons are quite annoyed looks like you mightve saved earth for nothing
whoevers responsible jettisoned the klingon crew into space dna was recovered from the bodies
let me guess human
not quite
i see
they were augments their geneticallyenhanced dna matched embryos stolen from a medical facility over twenty years ago stolen by you
soong used to work at cold station 12 a top secret medical research station
isnt that where starfleet keeps a stockpile of infectious diseases
along with geneticallyengineered embryos left over from the eugenics wars its been kept from the public for obvious reasons
i remember soongs trial he wouldnt say what he did with the embryos he stole
now he now claims that he took them to a planet in the trialus system and raised them they were around ten years old when he was captured a decade ago
so there could be a bunch of augments from the eugenics wars running around loose
not a pretty thought
what would they want with a klingon bird of prey
we dont know neither does soong at least he claims he doesnt but he does think he can convince them to surrender without a fight
youre bringing him along
theres also the fact that he spent time in the borderland
the borderland
the area where the klingon ship was attacked
its a volatile region between the klingon empire and the orion syndicate it attracts the most dangerous elements from both
sorry i asked
the klingons have threatened to retaliate with everything theyve got were the fastest ship and the most experienced crew we have to find the augments and bring them back its the only way to avert a war we launch in six hours
weve mastered their engine controls
wingmounted disruptor cannons photon torpedo launchers this ships an arsenal
were finally free
a fine ship
i thought youd be pleased
i didnt sanction this attack if youd failed they wouldve come after all of us
i didnt fail
their government knows what we did they have ships hunting for us right now
they wont find us it was time for us to leave this godforsaken planet
that was my decision not yours youve forgotten who i am have you
no raakin
say it
you are our leader
dont ever make me ask you again notify me when the rest of our supplies are onboard were leaving orbit
permission to come aboard sir
this is my science officer tpol
no need for an introduction i admire your people very much we share a similar view of humanity
what view is that
that it could stand some improvement
i believe thats true of most species if not all
my tactical officer lieutenant reed
doctor
ive heard of you but i dont recognise your face youre not getting your fair share of publicity
i think ive had all i can stand
weve prepared some quarters youll be under guard at all times if you should decide you need to clear your head
were on a starship soon to be at high warp where exactly would i go
its this way
if i could examine the dna samples the klingons recovered i could tell you something about the current state of the augments
ill have the information sent to your quarters
a laboratory would be preferable your sickbay doctor phloxs reputation rivals my own before i was imprisoned of course id enjoy trading notes with him
ill consider it
so how was the honeymoon
honeymoon
you were on vulcan another two weeks after i left i figured
it comes with everything but its own protein resequencer for that ill need another day
i like it
we dont have time to go over all the details just try not to hit that button
were cleared for launch
here we are again
wouldnt have it any other way travis
i just received an intelligence report a klingon warship was spotted near proxima colony admiral forrest thinks they could be conducting reconnaissance for a future strike i wanted to keep you up to date
my government is trying to work out a diplomatic solution theres still a chance theyll be successful
small chance one other thing
its your first official day of duty commander tpol a present its from the early twentieth century should help keep you pointed in the right direction
im glad youre with us
thank you captain
malik he was the rebellious one reminded me of myself when i was his age i came to think of them as my own children
it mustve been difficult for you to leave them behind
i knew theyd survive
this is extremely sophisticated work for twentieth century earth
well i made some modifications of my own
really what kind of modifications
i prefer to let my work speak for itself
i think it already has
i didnt realise you shared humanitys reactionary attitude toward this field of medicine
on the contrary weve used genetic engineering on denobula for over two centuries to generally positive effect
but you dont approve of what ive done
you tried to redesign your species the first time that was attempted on earth the result was thirty million deaths
we cant let past mistakes hold us back
its your responsibility as a scientist to learn from past mistakes
well what makes you think i havent
i can read
two vessels are coming up behind us
orion interceptors
interesting way of saying hello hoshi
no response
were getting hammered down here
keep firing
im picking up an energy surge from one of the interceptors
a weapon
no
tucker to the bridge two of my people just disappeared
the interceptors have jumped to warp theyre gone
they took nine people including tpol
there never used to be orions in this area they mustve expanded their range of operations its a shame i really liked your science officer
how do i get them back
its not going to be easy
thats not what i asked you
theyve most likely been taken to a processing station the nearest ones on verex three
archer to bridge
reed
set a course for verex three best possible speed
yes sir
whatll happen to them there
theyll be ushered into their new profession as slaves these stations are heavily guarded only legitimate traders are permitted to enter
i have the feeling youve found your way in
i had to establish a relationship with the orions they helped me acquire certain goods and equipment i needed to survive i can get you inside but i cant get your people out
one step at a time
raakin is taking us to another system where we can live out our lives in peace but im sure hes already told you that
he doesnt tell me everything
this isnt what our father wouldve wanted he didnt raise us to run away and hide
well what do you propose
you could try to convince raakin to reconsider
he only wants one thing from me and it isnt advice
it doesnt suit you
what
playing the victim you chose raakin you wanted the strongest for yourself
i still do what is it you want
theres plenty of time for that
you are now the property of the orion syndicate break the rules and you will suffer follow the rules and you will suffer less take her
ensign
commander
are you all right
this thing it hurts
dont touch it have you seen anyone else from the ship
just you where are we
an orion slave market
slave market
the orions traffic in forced labour were being processed for auction
this cant be happening theyre going to come for us right the ship
ensign
the captains going to get us out of here
ensign i dont know your name
pierce jeffrey pierce i just signed on
jeffrey enterprise will come it may take some time we should try to stay together until they get here
transmit your identification code
soong hasnt used this code in years
give it time
youre cleared to proceed
phlox transponder it has a range of ten kilometres
you wander off more than a step or two we bring you right back here
you dont like me do you commander tucker
no i dont
you probably blame me for whats happened to your vulcan friend
thats enough
your crew could use a sense of humour
make the engines a priority when its time to leave i have a feeling were going to need all the speed we can get
ive read every transcript of every mission i thought i was prepared that i knew what to expect boy was i wrong
if you wish i can teach you how to minimise your anxiety
yeah id like that id like that a lot
leave her alone
ensign dont
youre doing well
three million six not even my last wife sold for that much
stand up bring that woman
over here
at least we know four of your people are still here doesnt seem to be much demand for humans
those devices on their necks
neurolytic restraints ingenious really they induce convulsive seizures in disobedient slaves if a slave attempts to leave the premises
so if we try to beam them out
wouldnt recommend it not if you want them alive
they sell their own people
only the women orion females are known for their extreme appetites their innate skills
come on
tpol you all right
how many were taken
nine weve located five so far were working on a way to try and
shes sold buyers are over there
we made a wrong turn thank you so much though thank you for your help really thank you lets go
he argues with every command i give defies me in front of the others
some of them agree with what he did taking this ship
theyve forgotten how weve stayed alive all these years my resolve was what kept us from starving to death on that rock
they believe its malik who liberated us from that rock
you agree with them
how can you say that
i hear it in your voice
maliks doing more than arguing with your commands hes plotting against you he wants to take your place
how do you know that
he told me maliks always wanted me i knew he was planning something so i let him think i wanted him as well he said that youre weak that youre making all of us weak that youre betraying fathers principles that if father were here hed choose malik to lead us
i will betray fathers principles im going to kill my own brother
if you dont sell as a slave i will sell you as food
oh thats barely enough to cover the expense of processing you
archer to enterprise
tucker here
weve located everyone including tpol im going to need six kilos of tritanium cobalt
nine
make that nine
thats half our supply
ill explain later just get it ready
yes sir
they normally remove the restraint after a sale we used the extra tritanium to bribe one of the guards to deactivate it but leave it on him
why cant we just buy the rest of our people
tpols already been sold we dont have time to try and buy them all
were almost there try to hold still
what kind of people are these
id say theyre not unlike some of your ancestors judging from your accent
well if i remember my history these augments you love so much had plenty of slaves
they were more like subjects
oh they were just treated like slaves
tpol could be shipped out any second work fast
i told him everything he thinks youre planning an attack against him
is he going to move against me
see for yourself is this the move you expected
its between us i saved your life once when we were children pulled you from the river when you fell in
i remember
now ten years later youre plotting against me
im the strongest and the smartest
doesnt look that way from here you would never have trapped me like this
but i have
im sorry raakin
its between us
saul jaya listen to me
they only listen to me now there was a time when i looked up to you when i called you my brother
i am your brother
when you rejected our fathers wishes you stopped being one of us and when that happened you ceased to exist
which makes this an act of mercy get rid of him
dont not for him
were sending the code now
got it
outside outside
the restraints are off
slaves are loose slaves are loose
trip start beaming them five at a time
sorry captain i hope you find your people thanks for the ride
youve got spirit i might just keep you for myself
im not for sale
trip have you got everyone
you and soong are the only ones left
soong got away
locate him and beam him up
soongs transponder signal its dead
can you scan for his biosign
were trying but theres too many people down there
help me dont let them take me
trip two to beam up
you knew exactly where the orions were operating you knew theyd abduct members of my crew maybe you were even hoping theyd get you
there was an outside chance
you were determined to escape no matter who got hurt
no one was injured
nine of my people were nearly sold into slavery two of them may have permanent physical damage because of the restraints
i didnt take this action lightly
is that supposed to justify what you did
im simply saying it wasnt easy for me to place you and your crew in jeopardy i respect you captain
then tell me how to find the augments you know where theyre going
they didnt steal a klingon ship to go sightseeing
theyre dangerous
theyre the future theyre stronger smarter free from sickness with life spans twice as long as our own you more than anyone should appreciate what this means
why me
your father suffered from clarkes disease his final years were marked with extreme pain
my father has nothing to do with this
he didnt need to suffer genetic engineering couldve cured him those who want to suppress my augments are the same ones who condemned your father to death turn the ship around captain go home leave them alone
im going to find them doctor whether you help me or not
youre supposed to be resting
doctor phlox says i can resume my duties this afternoon
im glad they got that thing off with no problem
theres a slight ringing in my left ear but it should dissipate over time
good well ill let you get back to that
vulcans dont have honeymoons after the ceremony i went to mount seleya to meditate alone
its none of my business anyway
orion interceptors two of them coming up fast
theyre hailing us
this is captain archer of the starship
youve stolen our property
they were members of my crew you kidnapped them
disengage your warp drive and deactivate your weapons
that isnt going to happen  malcolm
theyre targeting our nacelles
were dropping out of warp
torpedoes
theres another ship
the second orion is veering off theyre retreating
the klingons are requesting to dock
i know hes on this ship we received his signal
when he tried to escape i saw him access a console
you were expecting us where is he
in the brig
in a prison cell i want to speak with him
i cant allow that
we saved your ship
my ship wouldnt have been in danger if we hadnt come looking for you
what is it you want with us
my orders are to take you back to earth
earth considers my father a criminal why because he brought us to life you want to take us back to a world that opposes our very existence
you attacked a klingon vessel theyre threatening war
thats not our problem we dont care what happens to you humanity is no longer relevant to quote one of your philosophers nietzsche mankind is something to be surpassed
you think he was talking about you
im about to attack you
you see even with a warning youre not fast enough
let him go
let him go
ill tear out his throat lower your weapons now
persis
ive broken their security code were ready
ill kill him
persis
persis  i cant believe it
father heres malik
malik
i knew wed see each other again im proud of you of all of you
soong listen to me
theres nothing to say captain
what should we do with them
let them go
but theyll just come after us
their ships disabled by the time its repaired well be far away its been a pleasure captain take my advice go home and start learning how to speak klingon
there were times back on earth when i doubted myself my work but seeing you all i know that everything ive fought for was worth it were going to build a new world but we cant begin that task just yet thousands of your brothers and sisters are waiting to be born lets go get them
some claim humanity rose up against the augments others say the augments began fighting among themselves whoever started it the war devastated earth millions perished and when it was over people like you were feared humans will always fear you they fear your power your intellect they fear you because youre everything they want to be but cant be which is why i brought you here where its safe ive raised you like my own you call me father but im only watching over you you belong to the future and someday you will fulfill humanitys promise
malik
are there others like us
many others waiting asleep and someday itll be your duty to wake them set them free
well have to reach this sublevel security personnel are located here and here
a direct hit to this power conduit would demolish their life support systems all wed have to do is wait a couple of hours
no
but we could walk in unopposed
were not going there to take lives
but what if they dont give us a choice
no one is to be killed is that understood  malik
yes understood father
protein resequencer water purifier
everything youd need to keep a small colony of humans alive looks like this place doubled as a classroom
imagine having soong as your teacher
with that and their screwed up genes its no wonder they turned out the way they did
trip
interfaces they look a lot like the ones we have in our sickbay id say they took medical equipment with them
i need to know exactly what kind its important
ill see what i can find out
well check out the rest of this place
ill be damned
hold it
captain
leave me alone
were not going to hurt you
get out of my way
we just want to talk malcolm
see were friends
who are you
im captain jonathan archer were from earth
this was raakins i gave it to him when he was five he was a good student he loved astronomy wed sit at night and id point out the stars he could name every one wheres your brother malik
i dont know what youve been told
no one will say anything i only know hes not here
hes dead
tell me what happened
he turned his back on your word he didnt want to liberate the others
what happened to him
i killed him we were arguing he pulled out a knife i drew mine he came at me the next thing i remember there was blood everywhere  it was an accident i tried to save him i tried
he was your brother
im sorry father i didnt mean to hurt him im sorry
malik its my fault i left you alone
no
i should have stayed with you you were just children
no father
shh im sorry im so sorry malik im sorry
hes dehydrated suffering from slight malnutrition but otherwise hes in good condition
for an augment he didnt put up much of a fight
he isnt an augment hes an anomaly his dna is similar to the others but not identical he was born with none of their enhanced abilities
hows the jaw
it hurts
im sorry about that but you didnt give me much choice i told you my name
my real names udar but my brothers and sisters call me smike
thats an unusual nickname
its from nicholas nickleby
his handicapped friend is that why you were left behind because youre different
i wouldve slowed them down
udar
smike
i need to find out where they went the others
im not telling you anything
im trying to help them
youre from earth you dont want to help them you want to kill them
thats not true
i wont betray my brothers and sisters
your brothers and sisters are in danger they attacked a klingon ship if the klingons find them before we do
then more klingons will die youll never stop them captain no one will
tucker to captain archer
go ahead trip
the missing equipment they were incubators
artificial wombs
hes different than i remember
how
the man who raised us would never risk our lives to protect a human
he knows the station he used to work there he knows what hes doing
well find out
you shouldnt doubt him
why not
hes our father
hes human
hes not like other humans
i used to believe that
you were leading us before and now he is you cant accept that
why shouldnt i lead augments should be led by augments
i wont listen to this
let me go
dont be angry with me im just thinking out loud
i dont like what youre thinking
then ill stop stay with me
i think soong is headed to cold station twelve
isnt that where he used to work
its a medical facility run by starfleet and the denobulans highly virulent diseases are stockpiled there for research purposes
its the embryos from the eugenics wars that soongs after
i thought soong stole the embryos
he took nineteen but there are over eighteen hundred more
thats why he took the incubators with him
why werent these embryos destroyed after the war
at the time it was too controversial earths governments couldnt decide how to handle the issue so they put them into cold storage i just got off with admiral forrest weve been authorised to use whatever force necessary to stop soong i need all the speed you can give me
youll have it
this is cargo ship corsair repeat medical emergency situation is critical
corsair this is barzai a denobulan medical ship whats the nature of your emergency
reactor leak ten crewmen exposed to delta radiation
i have a fix im about six minutes away from you
barzai stand down and prepare to be boarded
hows the patient
hes doing fine ready to be discharged
good i just reviewed the crew manifest for c12 one of the names is doctor jeremy lucas hes senior medical director
in his last correspondence he mentioned he was being transferred he didnt say where
i thought you should know
i appreciate it captain i spent a few months at c12 myself i know the security protocols im familiar with the technology id like to be included in the landing party
consider it done
thank you
phlox tells me hes ready to free up this biobed
so ive been told
if youve had enough sickbay food id like you to join me in the captains mess
do i have a choice
no see you in an hour
cold station twelve this is medical ship barzai transmitting security code
barzai we are currently on heightened alert slow to onequarter impulse and transmit security code
transmitting
code confirmed youre clear to proceed
why are you flying a denobulan shuttle
why not
you arent denobulan
thats true
we dont have enough masks
you dont need masks
doctor lucas
i asked you never to bother me when im watching a viropathic cytolysis
our defence protocols just came on
did you contact security
i cant reach them the comms down
the systems been taken offline
doctor
what the hell 
phlox tells me youd been living on your own for quite a while
i left the camp about a year ago
you must be pretty resourceful to survive by yourself out there
it wasnt that hard
didnt look like a very friendly planet when you get back to earth you should consider going to school
school
youve got a lot of catching up to do
how can i go to school if im in prison
what makes you think youre going to prison
im an augment
i dont know what youve been told about earth youre not going to be punished
thats not what my father said
soong is not your father
what do you mean
your biological father was miklos karlovassi he was a geophysicist
how do you know that
we got the information from soongs computer your mothers name was irina she was an athlete decathlon won a silver medal in the olympics weve got a lot of historical data on both your parents youre welcome to look at it
coffee
im approaching a new sleep cycle
when does your hibernation begin
not for another few weeks but i would like to increase my body mass by at least ten percent to tell you the truth im not very hungry
youre worried about doctor lucas
weve been friends a very long time
were getting there as fast as we can phlox
you might be interested to know smikes become quite the student of earth history hes been reading up on the eugenics wars
i doubt soong gave him the whole story
im quite familiar with the subject myself human intellect and human instinct were out of sync so many people were killed
the official number was thirty million some historians say it was closer to thirty five
i can understand why earth banned genetic engineering
what do you know about clarkes syndrome
its a degenerative brain disorder that afflicts humans
my father died of it when i was twelve
im sorry
he had frequent pain hallucinations he talked to people who werent there often couldnt recognise me or my mother the last two years of his life
and you were thinking if genetic engineering had been permitted
maybe soong has a point
ive had time to examine his work more closely im forced to admit some of it is extremely inventive hes really quite brilliant its a shame such a man has to remain incarcerated
he broke the law thats why he was in prison and thats why im going to make sure he goes back denobula perfected genetic engineering a long time ago but you never came close to destroying yourselves
perhaps we were simply fortunate
or maybe your instincts had caught up with your intellect foods getting cold
i dont have the code
when i was senior medical director i had access to those embryos
they changed the policy after what you did the access code can only be obtained through starfleet command
hes lying
im telling the truth
do the lights in your office flicker every now and then
every two hours drives me crazy
faulty power relay you wouldnt believe how many times i asked them to fix it ten years later they still havent done a thing put him with the others
father
i believe him
tell me
its a hexadecimal password im creating an algorithm to compute the possible combinations a few hundred thousand of them it may take a few minutes
i cant believe i held you back in math
a ships entering the system
range twenty million kilometers
any sign of the birdofprey
none it could be hiding behind any one of the larger asteroids
were being hailed
put it up
captain i wish i could say its been a long time
this only ends one way doctor
i think youve underestimated the variables about eleven of them
no one will be harmed if you leave this system immediately
im betting youre not a coldblooded killer
turn your ship around now
i want proof that the hostages are unharmed let me speak to lucas
go ahead
were all right no ones been hurt
thats about to change youre still approaching this station
do you have any idea what a klingon disruptor will do to a human skull at this range
youre going to leave me with an awful mess to clean up
doctor
conversations over he dies
all stop
now turn around
bring us about
thats a good captain
theres another layer of encryption it appears to be on a quantum level
how long
longer than i thought maybe a lot longer
keep working
he lied doctor lucas about the embryos station access log
get him in here
ive modulated the transporter frequency to match the stations containment field if you register at all on their sensors itll look like a field echo
do you really think i can help
if i didnt i wouldnt have asked you to come along
captain were nearly out of transporter range
energise
malik malik i want to put an end to this doctor
so do i
we know you can get to the embryos you accessed the stasis chamber just last week
thats a mistake in the log
i implore you give us what we came for and well leave you in peace
whats that
that language is unbecoming of a man of science
father
some men are braver with their own lives than they are with the lives of others
bring in one of his colleagues
no not here in there
there are thousands of pathogens stored here some kill within minutes
no
the longer were in this facility the greater the chance that more ships will come and they might not back down like enterprise
it isnt necessary
its the only way to make him talk is one human being worth all our lives and everything youve worked for
if thats what it takes to stun them what have you got to do to kill them
are you familiar with symbalene blood burn the vascular lining literally boils away
you son of a bitch
actually mother was a chemist
you cant do this
believe me i dont want to but im out of options doctor the code this is on your conscience then not mine
life support runs through this relay
how long before they run out of air in the control hub
half an hour they should start feeling the effects within ten fifteen minutes
were not talking about normal human beings here
even an augment needs oxygen
his temperatures rising quickly blood pressures approaching critical theres still time doctor
just say the word ill release the antipathogen
theres fluctuation in the life support relay on level four
go
right about now his extremities feel like theyre on fire but its the capillaries starting to burst watch
please let me out
im asking you one doctor to another stop this
i cant
is it worth this mans life
i have orders
i can save him how can you let this happen
how can you
tell me the code the code
go to hell
release the antipathogen
father
do it
no
that should do it
smike
doctor phlox missed something when he examined me captain i do have one enhanced ability i can hear like they do theyre coming
hes wrong captain were already here
there was a spike then the signal was gone
sounds like what happens when a communicator goes down
to prevent us from getting a transporter fix
theyve been captured
its a logical conclusion
we have to make sure
agreed
jeremy
phlox what are you doing here
dont move
its good to see you again
am i going to spend the rest of my life trying to get rid of you
youre going to spend the rest of your life in prison
udar
father
how is this  they told me you were dead that you were sick
they lied to you
it was raakins order
what was
banishment
why
he wasnt strong enough
you all went along with this
why are you so surprised whenever a group of people start believing theyre better than everyone else the results are always the same
i dont need a history lesson from you
you need it from someone
its enterprise
we have your people i asked you not to interfere
now
tpol execute your orders
end transmission bring up the data file
enterprise enterprise come in
they cut us off
what are these orders
to initiate the stations selfdestruct sequence
in a few seconds this place will be dust
youd kill us all rather than let the embryos be born
it wasnt my idea the orders came from starfleet but after seeing this i cant say i disagree
we were defending our right to exist
youve already killed over twenty five people your existence has a pretty high price
it could get higher
the sequence is coming up
tpol
proceed
transmitting ten seconds to autodestruct
its some kind of feedback pulse its the signal we sent its being amplified a thousand percent comms dead
the stations still there its safe to say were going to need another plan
well destroy it ourselves
that things buried inside an asteroid
its not the preferred solution but its all we have load photonic torpedoes mister mayweather
course set
take us in
looks like this place isnt turning to dust sorry to disappoint you
theyre friends i heard them talking  is this true doctor lets find out
no
leave him alone
malik
youll tell us what we want to hear or youll watch him die too
five thousand kilometres
lock weapons
starboard nacelle
return fire
stop stop
no no ill give it to you dont kill him ill give it to you
input the code
the stasis chamber is opening it worked
get him out of there
you come with us
im going to stay
i understand i hope you have a long happy life
you too father
they fire then move off
theyre trying to draw us away from the station
a few more like that were going to be a part of this asteroid field
hold your course target the facility
theyre beautiful
i came here so many times just to look at them i remember where each of you was kept you were there right next to saul persis yavar it was so hard to choose nineteen out of so many
father
i never thought id see this sight again
we have to hurry
telurian plague i like the sound of that
what are you doing
identifying the most dangerous pathogens
youre taking them with us
cant hurt to have a little insurance theyve been transferred to the stasis modules take two people with you load them onto the shuttle
get them in the containment cell
i wasnt sure how id justify killing you now youve given me the perfect excuse
whatever i can do to help
hold onto that youre a competent fighter but that isnt good enough
i wish i had time to continue our little match im enjoying it but this will be almost as satisfying five minutes after we leave every stasis field in this station will shut down releasing hundreds of pathogens i wonder which one will kill you first
stick around and find out
i like you captain i cant allow my brother to die in such a way this will be much less painful
smike
theyre launching a shuttle
the birdofpreys moving to intercept
whos on the shuttle
augments and one human
soong fire torpedoes
theyve launched a torpedo
maximum thrusters
four minutes to containment breach theres no way to stop it from here
somewhere else
the primary junction
where is it
containment breach in forty seconds
hes almost there
im at the primary junction
you have to divert the secondary relays
the panel to the left
i see them
twenty seconds
hes isolated this room the pathogens cant reach us
what about the captain
the ventilation grid is going to carry the pathogens through the rest of the station including the central core
how long do i have
less than a minute
archer to tpol
go ahead
can you get
a transporter lock on me
theres too much interference from the core
youll have to get farther away
arm the phasecannons target exterior hatch
j nine
captain the core will decompress
thats the idea stand by on the transporter youll only have a few seconds
acknowledged
warning pathogens detected in the central core
tpol
were ready
fire
commander do you have him
yeah we need a medic down here
weve crossed into klingon space
wheres enterprise
theyre holding position
archers not foolish enough to follow us
we wont be seeing archer again
what are you saying
hes dead
no one was to be killed without my express order
i had no choice he attacked us tried to escape
if you disobey me again ill lock you in the targ pit you wont see the light of day for a month do i make myself clear
yes father
whats our speed
holding at warp three point eight
not fast enough the port inducer assemblys been damaged go to engineering and repair it
im not an engineer
youre a bright boy malik im sure youll figure it out
first officers log supplemental weve evacuated the away team and all personnel from the station the captain shows no sign of infection hes recovering in sickbay
they crossed the klingon border approximately two hours ago
soongs not even bothering to cover his tracks
he knows the klingons will intercept us if we follow him they have half a dozen patrols in the area
is there something we can do to keep us from showing up on their sensors
i could paint a birdofprey on the hull
perhaps we could fake a klingon warp signature
id have to reconfigure the coil assembly it would take a few hours but it should be doable
whats the status of c12
doctor lucas and his team would like to return and begin decontamination procedures
thats quite a mess theyve got to clean up
he estimates it will take more than a year
once were safely through klingon space well set a course for these coordinates the klingons call it klach dkel brakt i call it the briar patch its a little catchier dont you think
briar patch
you should have read more of the books i left for you the region is flooded with radiation from supernova remnants the klingons have never mapped it there are signs of at least two habitable planets inside the briar patch its unlikely anyone will find us
this is your plan to hide again
the embryos need to mature in a safe environment
starfleet isnt going to give up so easily theyll send other ships this gas cloud wont protect us
all right what course would you set
im not certain but i know that running away isnt the answer are you familiar with the name botany bay
its a penal colony on the shores of australia
its also the name of a prewarp vessel launched at the end of the great wars the ship carried many of our brethren including khan noonien singh
botany bay is a myth theres no evidence it ever existed
all records of the launch were destroyed they didnt want to be followed
even if youre right the ship was lost never to be heard from again
thats exactly my point khan was a great leader but he made one fatal mistake he ran from his enemies rather than face them weve spent our entire lives running and hiding when are we going to make a stand
the matter is not open for debate alter our heading set a course one eight four mark three were going to the briar patch ill be in my lab
i wasnt aware the doctor discharged you
he didnt whats our status
holding position near the klingon border
bridge to engineering
are we ready
understood tactical alert take us in travis warp four
come in malik
you asked for me
you have to stop challenging my authority in front of the others
cant a son disagree with his father i thought we were family
im willing to overlook the things youve done but you have to trust that what im doing is best for all of us you used to have faith in me
i was a child i didnt know any better
i know it wasnt easy after i left
how are the embryos
ill be ready to incubate the first of them in a few hours
youre manipulating its dna
these basepairs sequences regulate the neurotransmitter levels in their brain if i can modify them aggression and violent behaviour will be removed
youre changing its personality
im correcting a defect in its genome genetic engineering was in its infancy when you were created they werent able to repair all the mistakes
did you fix these mistakes in the rest of us
i didnt know how until recently
what right do you have to tamper with their genome
trust me i know what im doing
you dont know that this is a defect maybe this is the way our creators wanted us to be
father youre needed on the bridge
theres a ship approaching at high warp
have you identified it
it appears to be klingon
lets see them
this ship has minimal aft weapons
increase speed
arm torpedoes open a channel this is captain archer
drop out of warp or well disable you
he sounds pretty confident for a dead man aft torpedoes target their propulsion systems
forward platings holding
return fire
aft shields at fifty percent
we should engage them
they outgun us three to one
father
the denobulan pilot put her aboard the shuttle go
scan for any planets along our flight path
their warp fields fluctuating
concentrate all fire on their engines
theyve altered course theyre heading for a planetary system
weve reached the coordinates
take us out of warp
theyre moving into a low orbit
theyre opening their shuttlebay doors
hold your fire magnify
biosigns on the shuttle
one denobulan
can you get a transporter lock
the atmosphere is too dense
were being hailed its soong
murdering hostages is turning into a new hobby for you
no ones been
killed captain that ship is caught between two thermal layers it should be relatively safe for four or five hours enough time for you to mount a rescue mission
this isnt over doctor
goodbye captain
hes gone to warp
disconnect that circuit before you power the relay you might damage it
warp trails been dispersed enterprise wont be able to follow us
excellent work
theres something else we need  father i need to speak with you
what is it
weve underestimated them starfleet isnt going to stop until they find us
and what do you suggest we do turn ourselves in
before we left c12 i beamed aboard two dozen canisters of biogenic agents
you did what
we can modify a torpedo to carry the pathogens
a single torpedo would never make it through their hull plating
i wasnt talking about the enterprise we use it against the klingons the quvat colony is less than four lightyears away if we detonate the torpedo inside the upper atmosphere itll scatter the pathogen across the entire planet every organism on the surface will be dead within days when the high council hears that humans have decimated their colony theyll launch a counterstrike the klingons will keep starfleet busy for years
what youre proposing is mass murder
there is no other choice how long will it be before starfleet turns to the klingons for help in finding us this is the only way to guarantee our survival
go back to the bridge
what happened to you in prison youre not the man who raised us the man who was willing to do whatever was necessary
return to your station
target the directional array on grid four five nine how are your parents
theyre fine they moved into a new house in mississippi its not like the old place in panama city but its pretty nice why do you ask
you havent spoken of them recently in fact youve said very little since i returned from vulcan
there hasnt been a lot of time to catch up
you also havent joined us at the captains table since we left earth
what are you trying to say
youve been avoiding me
well maybe i have but you got to admit its a little awkward i mean youre married i know you did it to help your mother but its going to take me a little time to adjust
im still adjusting to it myself
this is going to sound strange but as tough as it was watching you go through with the ceremony i was proud of you for what you did yeah i guess its probably for the best
what do you mean
come on its not like we would have made an ideal couple a vulcan and a human romeo and juliet probably stood a better chance
subspace distortion zero point four light years
theres no sign of a warp trail
they might have concealed their engine emissions
engineering to bridge
go ahead
i think weve found him captain
you dont sound a hundred percent sure
its the best weve got
send the coordinates to mister mayweather lay in a pursuit course maximum warp
i dont have a lot of time the aft launchers still offline and father wants me to
you wont have to answer to him any longer im taking command
you cant
ive already spoken with everyone on the bridge theyre behind me but i need to know where you stand you helped me before
that was different this is our father
he may have raised us but that doesnt make him our father hell never be one of us
dont do this to him
hes given me no choice i have a plan to protect us from starfleet and the klingons and he wont even consider it you know what hes doing with the embryos hes altering their genome making them weak and docile like ordinary humans
thats not true
go to his lab talk to him yourself i know how much he means to you i have feelings for him too hell be treated with respect you have my word are you with me
father please come with us
persis four of you to subdue me
the crew is united behind me
is that so theres no time for this you all have work to do
dont make this more difficult than it needs to be
and if i refuse are you going to kill me
no one else has to die
what about the millions you plan to kill with that bioweapon
please father theres no other way
lock him in his quarters
a klingon battle cruiser point three light years away theyre on an intercept course
archer to engineering
is there a problem with the camouflage
not that i can see
our klingon warp signatures holding steady
theyll be in visual range in less than two minutes
universal translator did you update the database
its been programmed with seven klingon dialects
lets hope this guy speaks one of them open a channel attention cruiser if you come any closer to my ship youll be fired upon
who is this
my name isnt your concern
youve entered restricted space drop out of warp and prepare for inspection
the last time i checked this was still klingon territory
no ship is allowed to pass through this system without authorisation on the orders of governor klag
i dont take orders from a mere governor were on important business for the high council
what sort of business
that matter is classified
im not detecting a council transponder signal perhaps you forgot to activate it
you expect me to turn on a transponder and let every ship in the area know that we have the chancellor on board
chancellor mrek is on your ship
he had important negotiations with the orions were taking him back to kronos
the orions  ive heard rumours of his negotiations with their females tell me is it true what they say about them
if i were you i wouldnt be making allegations about chancellor mrek over an unsecure channel
i meant no insult
im sure you didnt it would be best if you made no mention of this to your superiors or you might find yourself commanding a garbage scow
understood were honoured to have the chancellor in our system qapla
qapla
theyre altering course
dont tell me its visiting hour
im sorry father if i didnt go along with him he wouldve killed me
you did the right thing if he deploys that weapon hell be confirming everything theyve said about augments for the last hundred and fifty years theyll destroy all of you you have to help me stop him we can sabotage the engines or the torpedo launchers
no well never get to them maliks posted guards at every vital system
you have to get me off the ship
ive disabled the internal sensors it should be some time before anyone notices one of the escape pods is missing
be careful he might suspect you
what is it
an automated beacon its very faint it could be a distress signal
can you get a fix on it
captain what took you so long
you have to alter your
you have to alter your course
is that so
my children the augments are planning to attack a klingon colony
what were you doing in that escape pod
what do you think i was waiting for you youre the only one who can stop them i didnt come back because i missed our lively debates please please you have to do as i ask
your story doesnt sound very plausible i think we were getting close to finding your augments you may have put yourself into that escape pod to throw us off
youre not serious
youve made it clear youll do anything for them lie murder maybe even sacrifice yourself
if the klingons retaliate against earth itll make the xindi incident look like a lovers quarrel archer what do you care what happens to earth you believe your children are the future of humanity
captain captain contact c12 three hundred kilograms of biotoxins are missing from their inventory
doctor lucas already told me about the missing toxins
malik stole them without my knowledge hes going to use them on the colony you saw what he did on the station you know what hes capable of
you didnt know you had to see him murder someone in front of you
what do you want me to say that you were right about them and i was wrong maybe things would have been different if id been there for them if starfleet hadnt locked me away
none of that would have mattered in the end its in their nature they were engineered to be this way superior ability breeds superior ambition one of their creators wrote that he was murdered by an augment
work with soong hell show you how to scan for their warp trail i want to intercept them before they reach the colony
he may be leading us into a trap
i believe him
that planets over three light years away were going to have to push the engines pretty hard to get there in time
is that a problem
at that speed our phony warp signature might not fool the klingons
do what you have to do
youve been quiet
soong didnt get off this ship without help the sensor grid wasnt damaged in the attack someone took it offline to cover his escape
maybe he disabled it
he wouldve needed the security codes i never gave them to him
if father didnt do it then who
can you think of anyone
lokesh didnt seem that enthusiastic about your plan to attack the klingons
hes been in the weapons bay for a day and a half modifying the torpedo maybe i should torture him just to make sure what do you think only four of us have the codes of those four you and i are the only ones who werent on the bridge when soong escaped
you think i did it
your hearts beating faster perhaps its trying to tell me something
are you going to use that on me
if i have to
you shouldnt have done that
ill miss you
how long can we sustain warp five
as long as the captain wants it or until we blow up whichever comes first
adjust the scanning frequency fifteen megahertz  sorry about that business with the orions hope you werent permanently injured
why dont you stay focused on what youre doing
someones a little protective of commander tpol
i just dont like you very much
is that them
it is a ship but its not the birdofprey captain archer to the bridge
its a klingon vessel theyre on an intercept course
its a lot bigger than the last one this ones a d5 class battle cruiser
how long until were in visual range
two minutes
same as before hoshi
theyre hailing us
earth vessel surrender and prepare to be boarded
aft plating is failing
hail them again  if we dont reach the colony before that birdofprey millions of your people will be killed
i am not detecting any other ships perhaps you plan to attack the colony
captain if i may  captain archer and his crew are honourable people let them continue on their way
i tried
we may be able to surprise them with a torpedo if we drop to impulse
i wouldnt recommend that captain their sensors are far superior theyll detect it
theyre targeting our reactor
power down weapons stand by to deploy the grappler take us out of warp
theyve dropped to impulse
malcolm
two more seconds captain
on my mark travis
theyre closing theyre extending their docking port
malcolm
ready sir
full impulse
theyre targeting the grappler
hold your speed
the shearing force is approaching critical
were losing the grappler
hold your speed
they cant create a warp field theyre disabled
resume course for the colony maximum speed
there are three population centres two here and another on the northern continent
well detonate the torpedo over the southern hemisphere thatll ensure the maximum number of casualties whats the weapons status
weve modified the warhead but we need to test the guidance protocols before we can
theres a ship on an intercept course
the enterprise increase to maximum speed load the torpedo stand by to fire as soon as we drop out of warp
but the guidance protocols
do as i say
theyve detected us theyre accelerating
stay with them travis
tucker to bridge
if we go any faster the nacelles are going to fly off the pylons
long until were in weapons range
two minutes but the birdofprey will reach the colony in seventy three seconds
trip
i heard ill give you what i can
how much longer
guidance is still offline well need to get closer
take us into low orbit
theyre preparing to fire
travis
another fifteen seconds
take us out of warp as close as you can
weapons are standing by
ten seconds
torpedos ready
fire
theyve launched the weapon it will reach the atmosphere in twelve seconds
malcolm
hard about
a direct hit to the armoury weve lost hull plating torpedo launchers
what about phasecannons
the aft cannons online just barely
lock onto their bridge
no no no
stand aside doctor
their bridge is protected with dispersive armour your weapons will never penetrate it target your cannons here
behind their sensor array
what good will that do
their main plasma junctions located there a direct hit would disable their entire power grid trust me
do what he says fire when ready
theyre disabled
are they still alive
im reading twelve biosigns
captain theres a power surge in their reactor
hes overloading his dilithium matrix hell destroy their ship
let me talk to him
malik malik its father
dont do this some of your brothers and sisters are still alive
would you rather they go to prison with you
the embryos
theres no place for us on earth or anywhere else
better to die here
please please please
ill see you soon
malik
sir
ill contact starfleet on your behalf let them know that you helped us
i cant believe theyre gone all of them uh were heading the wrong way
youre not going to the brig im taking you to crew quarters
youre alive
you betrayed us all goodbye father
you could at least let me finish my work before you take it away and destroy it
no ones destroyed anything its being stored in a secure location maybe someday well figure out how to use it to benefit humanity
i wouldnt count on it
ive been thinking perfecting humanity may not be possible cybernetics artificial lifeforms
goodbye doctor
i doubt ill finish the work myself might take a generation or two
surak
admiral the high command will tell you its decision at the proper time
after all weve been through id rather hear the good news from you
the high command hasnt included me in their discussions
theyre not telling their own ambassador to earth what theyre planning welcome to the club
admiral i know you find our reluctance to share technology and discoveries restrictive
i can think of a few stronger words than that
we dont know what to do about humans of all the species weve made contact with yours is the only one we cant define you have the arrogance of andorians the stubborn pride of tellarites one moment youre as driven by your emotions as klingons and the next you confound us by suddenly embracing logic
im sure those qualities are found in every species
not in such confusing abundance
ambassador are vulcans afraid of humans why
because there is one species you remind us of
vulcans
we had our wars admiral just as humans did our planet was devastated our civilisation nearly destroyed logic saved us but it took almost fifteen hundred years for us to rebuild our world and travel to the stars you humans did the same in less than a century there are those on the high command who wonder what humans would achieve in the century to come and they dont like the answer
were not the klingons we only want to be your partners to do what the nations of earth have learned to do to work together in common cause
unfortunately the future of relations between our worlds is not mine to control
captain
here
thats another game twenty one to two
time to switch sides again doctor
certainly this is a most enjoyable sport reminiscent of octran fertility contests
captain ive just spoken with starfleet command
except were fully clothed which is probably for the best
im sorry to keep you from your family but im going to need you on the investigation fulltime
thats where i prefer to be
your mother and husband will understand
my mother hasnt responded to my communiqués its not unusual for her to become lost in her work as for my husband our arrangement remains unchanged
captain jonathan archer i regret we meet under such tragic circumstances
id like to introduce administrator vlas
administrator i wasnt told to expect the head of the high command
captain archer all of vulcan grieves with you today
twelve vulcans died in the blast ambassador
to that end this is stel chief investigator of our security directorate
captain we now have suspects
andorians why would they attack our embassy
to create conflict between earth and vulcan
they do consider us allies who stand against them
so far weve done our best to remain neutral and the andorians know that they have nothing to gain by attacking us
you have other suspects
syrrannites
ive never heard of that species
actually theyre a small group of vulcans they follow a corrupted form of suraks teachings
surak ive heard of hes the father of vulcan logic
even after eighteen hundred years we consider him the most important vulcan who ever lived
so why would these syrrannites want to attack our embassy its hardly an act of logic
theyve been vocal about their opposition to government but always peaceful
over the past year their leader a dissident named syrran has become a dangerous zealot
captain i trust you to keep this matter confidential we dont share it lightly but recently on our world there have been instances of violence against nonvulcans though we have no conclusive proof there are signs that syrrannites might be responsible
is there any evidence connecting syrrannites to the bombing
your embassy is officially considered to be on earth soil weve preserved the site for you to investigate
if evidence is there the chief investigator and i feel confident youll find it
i intend to
lieutenant heres the junction room
schematics say the secondary security banks right in there
still in one piece
theres a weak power signature under this mess
its probably an emergency light running on batteries well theres something here some kind of surveillance recorder
lieutenant
the timer might be broken but that bombs armed dont move the slightest vibration might set it off reed to enterprise i need an emergency transporter lock two to beam up on my mark
acknowledged
why not beam the bomb out of here
if theres a gravity switch itll detonate in the matter stream
enterprise to reed the transporters locked do you need assistance
negative enterprise stand by
im going to attempt to scan it
attempt
yeah if i had designed that bomb id rig it to go off the instant a sensor beam made contact look on the bright side if it detonates well never know steady theres vulcan dna on these controls so much for blaming andorians boosting scan resolution
that cant be good
oh damn enterprise mark enterprise
according to the vulcan genome registry the dna on the bombs controls was left by this woman tpau
since you had her dna on record does that mean shes been arrested before
the registry records dna from all vulcans at birth
do you know anything about her
tpau is a wellknown syrrannite
all right weve got a solid start now we need to find her
captain tpau is vulcan the security directorate will take charge of the investigation
of course vulcan sovereignty lieutenant reed and commander tpol will work with you
their assistance isnt required
chief investigator forty three people died in the bombing twelve vulcans and thirty one humans we want her as much as you do
this is now a vulcan security operation well inform ambassador soval of any developments that concern you
his death is a loss to both our worlds
if youre lost ambassador i can direct you to your shuttle
he saved my life in the explosion he could have saved himself
he always put the mission first
the last time we spoke he was anticipating the prospect of joint missions humans and vulcans working together
we have to make that possible despite the high command
it makes no sense to think the syrrannites are responsible for this outrage
we have dna evidence
recheck everything captain question everything and dont let them keep you on enterprise the answers you need are on vulcan and however far you have to take this investigation you have my support
enter
it is agreeable to see you
what is the purpose of your visit
does a husband need a purpose to visit his wife
your message was cryptic
by necessity the syrrannite threat has brought new security measures into effect private communications are no longer private
you have something to tell me that the authorities shouldnt hear
something to give you your mother asked me to deliver it personally she told me that its been in your family for generations and now its your turn to care for it
why didnt she give this to me herself
the new security conditions theyve forced your mother into hiding to avoid arrest
my mother
shes a syrrannite
a syrrannite and she never told you
whats important is that shes disappeared like the others facing unjustified arrest
like tpau
no theres a difference my mother wants me to find her
its called an idic
looks old
its been modified
this is a desert called the forge the routes the one surak supposedly followed
eighteen hundred years ago
syrrannites follow the same path today seeking enlightenment
and you think your mother is somewhere along that path
she told koss this was a family heirloom but ive never seen it before
she didnt want koss to know about the map with any luck we can use this to find your mother and tpau
captain have you seen the reports on this place its a hellhole
its a vulcan desert i expect itll be hot
its got electrical sandstorms geomagnetic instabilities so bad technology wont work so no communicators no scanners no phasepistols we cant even beam you into it youre going to have to walk in
ill be careful youve got enterprise you and malcolm keep the investigation going up here and whatever the vulcans tell you believe the opposite
present company excepted ambassador
captain commander this shows the gaps in our satellite surveillance when beamins cant be detected
im thinking were not exactly cleared to have this
have what commander all i see is a starfleet data module
right captain what if something goes wrong down there
it already has energise
this site is called gateway where surak supposedly began his journey into the forge
you keep saying supposedly you dont believe surak did the things they said he did
he brought logic to vulcan in an age we call the time of awakening but his writings from that period no longer exist
there must be some record of it
over the centuries his followers made copies of his teachings
let me guess with the originals lost whatevers left is open to interpretation
you find this amusing
i find it familiar we should get moving
i thought technology didnt work here
the dampening field only extends a few hundred metres above the ground patrol craft can fly over it but their sensors cant see us
no wonder the syrrannites like it here
were being stalked
what the hell was that
sehlat run
higher ground higher they wont climb
how long before it starts to lose interest in us
days at least theyre very persistent creatures when i was a child i had one as a pet
you had one of those
domesticated they were smaller slightly
how slightly
you have porthos
porthos doesnt try and eat me when im late with his dinner
vulcan children are never late with their sehlats dinner
i can believe that
the captain asked me to reexamine the dna from the bomb to see if anyone else might have handled it
you say you found an anomaly
in these chromosomal fragments here and here
what kind of anomaly
these are telomeres a genetic clock if you will each time a cell divides they grow shorter
sure thats how you tell how old someone is from a cell sample
though tpaus current age is thirty two standard years her dna recovered from the bomb has an age of only a few months
they used the dna they sampled when she was registered as a baby
precisely the evidence implicating tpau is false
captain archers gone after the wrong person
and theres no way to get word to him
doc take a look at this
its the recording malcolm recovered from the embassy
according to the security log this is when tpaus biometric signature was recorded
undoubtedly another fabrication
but look the guard recognised whoever it was and that guard is your patient
corporal askwith
he could be our only chance to identify who really planted the bomb
hes in a coma his cranial injuries are substantial i dont expect him to recover
there must be a stimulant you can inject him with something to bring him around just for a few minutes
theres only so much damage a human body can withstand
i dont care about his body doc we need whats in his mind
sounds like that klingon opera hoshi made us listen to
the path is safe again
thats quite a trick
youre a human
jonathan archer
travelling with a vulcan
tpol
curious
may we ask your name
arev
that means desert wind
does it why are you here
we could ask you the same thing
i follow the path of surak in meditation and study and you
im on a pilgrimage to study surak and logic tpol is my teacher
i welcome you to walk with me  but this is no place for your kind turn back
if its all the same ill walk with you too
this deserts called the forge for a reason it will test you and destroy you
the plain of blood some say surak crossed this expanse when the hot blood of battle still flowed green but with logic he cooled it
captain the reflected heat is too hot for you
ill stick to the sandcovered parts wherever i can
i wont need water for several more days
youd better protect your eyes from the glare
my inner eyelids will protect my vision my species evolved on this planet
how long have you tried to understand vulcan logic
ever since i met tpol
very well student of surak who said logic is the cement of our civilisation with which we ascend from chaos using reason as our guide
im new at this you tell me
something more basic then whats kirikinthas first law of metaphysics
im familiar with newtons first law of motion i imagine theyre pretty much the same
you havent been truthful about your presence here
have you
vulcans do not lie
ive dealt with the high command vulcans can lie and cheat with the best of them
the high command does not follow suraks true path no wonder you humans are their allies
from the questions he asked you i believe he is a syrrannite and its obvious that he doesnt trust us enough to take us to the others
that only leaves one option we have to tell him what he wants to know the truth
it may be too late for that sandfire
this mans our only witness
hes comatose braindamaged and hes human a mindmeld is dangerous under the best of conditions but under these
look i know phlox says there arent a lot of vulcans who can do this sort of thing but youve got to know someone who could at least try
those who do have the ability wont risk their careers by publicly attempting what you suggest
most vulcans see melding as deviant behaviour
whats that got to do with it
evidence will solve this crime not mindmelds
what evidence the dna on the bomb was planted
you can prove that
i can
ambassador i dont know what kind of pull it takes to mess with dna records on vulcan but i think were looking at a deliberate attempt to hide the truth
youre suggesting a conspiracy
one that cost forty three innocent lives
arent they worth a little risk
the needs of the many i can perform the meld
captain
over here
help me with this the sandfire can still reach us
i know this how did you get this medallion
from my mother
tles
youre a syrrannite
the daughter of tles serves on a human starship
when did you talk with her is she safe
youre the human responsible for the destruction of the monastery at pjem
is that going to be a problem
the high command defiled pjem when they used it to spy on andoria you exposed their hypocrisy
you seem to know a lot about us im guessing that means you know why were here
your mother is safe with the others at the tkareth sanctuary its not far ill guide you both there when the storm has passed
i dont know if this has ever been attempted with a human before
my mind to your mind our minds are one our thoughts are joined yes
i see what you see the embassy im at my station at your station so many new people arriving for the summit i dont recognise them all but some i know a package thats all right i dont need to see it go right through who are you who
ambassador whatd you see
how long do these sandfire storms usually last
a day perhaps two ive never seen one this strong but were safe here and were in no hurry
maybe we should be
the high command believes the syrrannites are responsible for bombing the earth embassy
thats not our way
they seem to think that it is that you and your leader believe in a corrupted version of suraks teachings
did your mother tell you the story
of the idic
infinite diversity in infinite combination words that are a mere shadow of its true meaning  surak tells us that the story of the idic has no end but it begins here at mount seleya
surak died on mount seleya
his body yes but his katra was spirited away before the last battle against those who marched beneath the raptors wings those who wanted to return to the savage ways
whats a katra
syrrannites claim its the essence of a vulcan mind that it can be transferred from the body before death then stored in some manner
some say suraks katra was found and now is carried by a syrrannite so all those who meld with him may touch suraks mind
syrrannites conduct mindmelding
surak tells us it is the heritage of every vulcan even those who dont believe in the practise
a witness
the guard recognised the person who brought in the bomb we found in the rubble
the syrrannite woman tpau
no it was you
i would like to interrogate this witness myself
youre not getting anywhere near him
perhaps i could speak with the guard
im afraid hes in no condition to be questioned hes in a coma
yet he provided an eyewitness account
we accessed his memories through a mindmeld
telepathic evidence is inadmissible
its not evidence at all you allowed this distasteful act to take place
i performed it
soval youve shamed vulcan and yourself the law leaves me no recourse youll be summoned to appear before the high command to account for your actions commander doctor
at one time the high command was only responsible for the exploration of space but thats changed
ive been told vulcans have never been explorers
i think youve been told many things about us that arent true
reseal the entrance
tpol
easy easy easy
listen the storm is gaining strength
arev
you must carry it to sanctuary
carry what
tuluk to vokau
you cant go back
im not a fool commander vlas was involved with the attack on your embassy hes responsible for blaming it on the syrrannites
then why turn yourself over to him
its the only chance ill have to reach the rest of the high command
what if theyre all in on it  if you really want humans and vulcans to work together someday you might start thinking about trusting us
right
arev
are you injured
im fine he said something in vulcan vokau
remember remember what
i think he punched me the storms over
the patrol craft are flying again they sound like theyre closing in on this location
he said we werent far from the tkareth sanctuary we should keep moving
after we bury him
theyre following a grid search pattern no sensors but they can still make visual contact we have to find cover before the sun comes up that way
theres nothing there
thats where the syrrannites are
how do you know
im good for a few more days
captain youre not vulcan
right
its almost dawn we need to find someplace to hide
no over here
that wont help us
dont resist
what do you mean
before we announce our decision is there anything you wish to say
my actions were taken in the best interest of vulcan and the high command
keeping secrets from us is in our best interest
had i revealed my abilities as a melder my years of service would not have been possible
your accomplishments have been noteworthy
they dont justify deception
deception has never been a stranger to this room
i caution you
one of our own members was responsible for bombing the earth embassy an act we tried to blame on the syrrannites
that assessment was correct our investigation of stel has revealed hes a syrrannite
i find that difficult to accept
numerous documents were discovered in his home the evidence is irrefutable syrrannites were responsible and theyll be dealt with accordingly regarding the matter at hand your position is terminated immediately youre to surrender all classified materials to the security directorate before leaving i remind you that your loyalty oath is still in effect a violation of that oath
im aware of the penalty
good is there anything else youd like to say
theres a great deal that needs to be said excellency but no ones willing to listen
who are you
captain of the earth vessel and you must be tpol you are a long way from enterprise
im here to find the person who bombed the earth embassy her name is tpau and she looks a hell of a lot like you
i am tpau
you murdered my friend along with forty other people
i had nothing to do with the destruction of your embassy
the evidence says you did
i havent left this desert for two years what does that tell you about your evidence
it tells me that youre lying
you have a lot to learn about syrrannites
you have a lot to learn about humans we dont sit back and do nothing while our people are attacked
no you traverse vast wastelands based on false information what did you plan to do when you found me place me under arrest
something like that
it seems everything ive heard about your species is accurate
mother
im pleased to see that youre all right
we have a great deal to talk about
agreed
you told them where to find us
yes
is there anyone else with you
no
to have crossed the forge by yourselves with the sandfire storms this time of year
we met a syrrannite he helped us find shelter
who was this person
his name was arev
he was struck down by an electrical charge
he didnt make it
hes dead are you certain his name was arev
thats what he told us
his true name was syrran he was our leader
captain are you all right
im okay right before arev died he grabbed me he put his hand on my forehead i felt something inside my head
do you think he was trying to meld with you
i dont know but ever since i havent been myself
you put us all in danger what if theyd been followed
i only wanted her to know i was safe
you couldve accomplished that without revealing our location
i cant change what ive done she doesnt deserve imprisonment i want her released
not until weve confirmed their story
my daughter wouldnt lie
shes not merely your daughter shes a member of starfleet and starfleet is allied with the high command theyll both remain where they are until im satisfied they can be trusted search patrols are flying day and night
theyre the least of our worries now
if syrran is dead then everything weve worked for is lost
i cant believe they threw you out just because you helped us
theres got to be some way you can fight this
who the hell put him in charge anyway
our society rewards merit vlas has demonstrated a singular talent for governing
what are you going to do now
youre referring to my career i havent given it much thought theres something more important we need to discuss have you made contact with tpol or your captain
we cant reach them and they cant reach us
vlas is determined to wipe out the syrrannites hes particularly intent on destroying their encampment in the forge
where the captain and tpol are headed
they may be in grave danger
you must have questions for me
i cant understand how you could join these people
ive been growing disillusioned with vulcan society for some time when i was forced to resign from the academy i began seriously to question my beliefs
and this is where you came for answers
syrrannites believe that vulcans have strayed from the teachings of surak considering what the high command has done in recent years the listening station at pjem the suppression of dissent our position isnt so hard to accept
you could have told me all this when i came to visit
the high command was just beginning to hunt down suspected syrrannites i was afraid i would be next i wanted to keep you out of it i know your marriage to koss was for my sake to help me regain my post
i dont want your apologies mother i want you to come back with me
i cant do that
when you gave me that map you knew id try to find you
i thought that if you could see what we were trying to accomplish
that id understand that id join you
i held out that hope yes its possible i was being foolish
extremely
war is taking its toll vulcan is tearing itself apart
who are you
you know who i am captain so much death hard to believe this will become known as the time of awakening
that was eighteen hundred years ago this doesnt feel like a dream
youre seeing the past through my eyes
syrran did something to me before he died
he chose you you dont trust vulcans captain and given your experiences with them i cant say i blame you the culture youve come to know isnt the one i helped to create my people have strayed and someone must restore them to the path
youve got the wrong man
sorry captain theres an earth expression were stuck with each other dont fight whats been given to you open your mind and your heart and the way will become clear
captain captain
weve pinpointed their location near the northeastern border of the forge
how accurate is this information
its based on data collected by search patrols theyve been conducting missions for several days were going to bombard the camp with photonic weapons
our goal isnt to exterminate these people
our goal is to maintain order
theyre in the deep desert what possible harm could they do us
theyve already destroyed an embassy
eventually theyre going to have to leave the forge and when they do we can apprehend them with little or no loss of life
its very likely that syrran himself is inside the compound with one decisive thrust we can cripple this insurgency perhaps end it we cant let an opportunity like this pass us by
a surgical strike could minimize the loss of life
the geomagnetic anomalies make a precision attack impossible this is the only way well begin preparations immediately
this man did he tell you his name
he seemed to think i knew who he was
did you
it was surak
we believe you
syrran possessed the katra of surak
katras are nothing more than a myth
i used to think that until i learned to open up my mind to other possibilities
if syrran knew he was close to death he would have tried to transfer the katra to someone else
i was near him when he died
there is only one way to be certain i have to meld with you
ive had my fill of mindmelds
the prospect doesnt appeal to me either ive never melded with a human before your unchecked emotions will no doubt prove distasteful however i ask your indulgence
my mind to your mind my thoughts to your thoughts our minds are merging
our minds are one
were in the desert theres a storm we find refuge in a cave sandlightning our minds are not alone theres someone else here with us i sense his presence
tpau
he has the katra
we can trigger a malfunction in this satellites imaging node itll take six minutes for the central processor to correct the error
that should be enough time to slip through the net wont they wonder what caused the glitch
errors occur frequently near the forge it shouldnt raise suspicion
mind if i ask you something why are you doing this i never got the impression you cared that much about humans seems like you were always finding something new to complain about
i lived on earth for more than thirty years commander in that time i developed an affinity for your world and its people
you did a pretty good job of hiding it
thank you
launch bay to commander tucker
go ahead travis
we should be ready within the hour
 what about helm control
ive rigged up a stickandrudder system itll get us where we want to go
but i cant promise a smooth ride
just dont tell malcolm about that part until youre underway
centuries ago a set of katric arks were discovered at the pjem monastery
katric arks
polycrystalline vessels allegedly used by ancient vulcans to preserve katras they were scanned analyzed one of the scientists even attempted to meld with them they found nothing to indicate the presence of a katra
the vulcan science academy was just as sceptical about time travel
do you really believe you possess the living spirit of surak inside you a man who died eighteen hundred years ago
not when you put it like that
there is a logical explanation
im listening
syrran melded with you before he died what youre experiencing is the residue of his thoughts
so im suffering from a mindmeld hangover
i wouldnt characterise it quite that way but essentially
it feels like more than that
you have no basis for comparison youve never undergone a mindmeld before
seeing surak is only a part of it i could swear ive been here before in this sanctuary its like coming back to the house you grew up in
syrran spent a great deal of time here
lets say youre right and it was just a mindmeld he still put something in my head and i want it taken out
that may not be possible
what can we do for you
where is your captain
hes indisposed at the moment can i help you
the investigation of the embassy bombing is nearly complete
you have a suspect
the evidence against him and the syrrannites is compelling theres no longer any need for your presence here
if its all the same to you wed like to stick around
wed prefer you didnt this is an internal matter well keep starfleet apprised if there are any subsequent developments
excellency
again you have my deepest sympathy for your loss
all of vulcan grieves with you
with all respect we arent leaving not until we know exactly what happened
ive also contacted admiral gardner im sure youll be hearing from him soon a pleasant journey
son of a bitch hung up on us
should i try to get him back
no one here has ever performed this ritual
ive studied it for some time i believe i can conduct it successfully
youd not only be placing suraks katra in jeopardy you could kill archer
the risks are acceptable
i doubt surak would agree
what alternative would you suggest that we follow this human
i believe your prejudice toward humans is clouding your judgment
you question my logic
syrran chose to place the katra in archer he must have had his reasons even if we dont understand them
the reason is obvious he was dying your daughter couldnt reach him in time he had to choose archer
that may be but we do have a choice now for the sake of everyone involved i ask you to reconsider
ive made my decision ill perform the procedure in one hour
and if archer dies
i wont sacrifice our future to protect the life of one human
you know im the one with a vulcan ghost in his head depending on who you believe but i dont feel half as bad as you look
im considering our options
at least we know your mothers okay
shes joined a violent cult shes not okay
i dont think these people had anything to do with the embassy
you sound convinced
lets just say its more than a gut feeling
weve come to a decision the katra must be removed
i cant argue with that
theres a procedure a ritual it will transfer the katra to another person
its not without risk
vulcan neurology is exceptionally resilient but a humans
the shock to your nervous system will be severe it could kill you
you must decline
were not offering a choice
youd do this by force
wed prefer that you undertake the ritual willingly it will stand a better chance of success however if force is required we wont hesitate to use it
lets get started
captain
its my call
admiral gardner followed the vulcan line straight down the middle he wants us out of here yesterday
did you tell him about the captain and tpol
i left that part out
enterprise was supposed to leave orbit an hour ago vlas is not a patient man
theres not a whole lot he can do about it
hell of a job travis
thank you sir
just find them and bring them back no sightseeing along the way
understood
weve got a recon satellite to jam
enterprise hasnt left orbit theyre maintaining a stationary position above the forge
keep monitoring them
yes excellency
we cant proceed with the operation while the earth ship is there
youre concerned about witnesses
gardner gave them an order to leave i heard the transmission
so were now monitoring their communications
they wouldnt disobey an order without a reason i intend to find out what it is
passed down through the ages the katra of surak father of all we hold true lives on in this man let it now live on in me
surak
good to see you again captain my appearance must be quite disconcerting i apologise
radiation sickness
were paying a heavy price for our foolishness logic has not won this day but this day wont last forever logic is at the heart of every vulcan even as the ashes fall my people are discovering a new way you can accomplish what syrran could not
but syrran
was a vulcan and youre human which means you are untouched by a culture that can no longer see its own imminent destruction we cannot let what happened to the vulcans of my time take place again find what my people have lost find the kirshara
captain
i failed surak chooses to remain where he is
the satellites been disabled youve got six minutes to get through
travis its all yours
probably shouldve skipped breakfast this morning
theyre through
these thermals are only going to get stronger
that was no thermal
the plasmacannons are still working but i cant say the same for the targeting sensors
we must be getting close to the geomagnetic field
it doesnt seem to be affecting them
they must have better shielding
ill have to aim manually can you get us on their tail
how are they still below us
weve lost part of the starboard wing
we have to abort
i think i can get us down
you wont be able to get us back up
thrusters are offline well have to fire the chemical rockets hang on
theyve been fired on they took damage but theyre heading back to enterprise
i guess six minutes wasnt enough
they mustve been monitoring us
three ships closing on our position were being hailed its administrator vlas
why did you launch a shuttlepod
why the hell did you fire on it
you had no authorisation answer the question
were looking for our captain
archers on the surface
hes in the forge searching for the syrrannites
you were ordered to leave orbit
i advised them to stay
i assume you assisted in disabling the security satellite
i gave them the code
commander tucker youre to break orbit immediately
were not leaving without the captain
you will leave immediately or ill order my ships to open fire
how is he
his breathing has stabilised but his fever is still high
he agreed to the ritual
if he hadnt you would have forced him you claim that suraks teachings have been corrupted by the high command but youre no different
there is a profound difference
you deceive yourself
tpol
i shouldnt have come here looking for you and i dont want anything more to do with you
if thats your wish
how long have i been out
more than three hours
i feel like i just pulled my head out of a plasma relay
you should rest
the kirshara
what do you know about it
it was important to surak and its in there
whats a kirshara
an artefact syrran led us here to find it
if he knows where it is
telescopes have sighted three vulcan cruisers in orbit over the forge
the high command knows were here we should evacuate immediately
give the order
i can find it
that one missed us by twenty metres
tactical alert polarise hull plating how many warning shots do vulcans usually fire
none
vlas
im running out of patience commander
weve been over this our captain and first officer are down there
well make sure theyre returned to you break orbit now
you really think hell do it
vlas will do what whatever it takes to accomplish his goal
vulcan and earth have been allies for a hundred years
syrrannites must have seen our ships by now if they evacuate into the forge theyll be extremely hard to track we cant wait any longer drive enterprise from orbit use all necessary force
yes excellency
phasecannons return fire
the vulcan ships are firing on enterprise
we could be next take charge of the evacuation well meet you on the forge as soon as we can
you cant stay here
ive spent two years searching for the artefact if theres a chance of finding it
tpol
im staying
go
reroute emergency power to phasecannons
hull breach on c deck theyre reporting casualties vlas is hailing audio only
put him through
youre hopelessly outgunned weapons are offline engines failing dont force me to destroy your ship
hes right we should withdraw our deaths wont help captain archer or tpol
get us the hell out of here
the moment enterprise is beyond scanner range begin bombardment of the compound
yes excellency
tklaas he was a student of surak one of the first kolinahr masters
theres no inscription nothing to indicate his bloodline how do you know his name
were getting close
theyve begun their assault
its here
i had my doubts whether it really existed
lets go this way
report
geomagnetic interference we cant get a target lock
blanket the area
the sanctuary has been destroyed
comb the desert make sure there are no survivors
affirmative
youre presiding over a massacre
we are eliminating a threat
are you all right
im fine
we should keep moving
captain
i was afraid you were still inside
its all right we found the kirshara
you have always struggled so with your emotions i came here i did all this to help you
i dont understand
you will
mother
ive always been so proud of you my tpol
mother
i understand we suffered casualties
injuries two of them serious
i share your concern about captain archer and tpol
theyve been in tough jams before
the syrrannites believe violence to be antithetical to suraks teachings
so theyre pacifists
vlas considers that a dangerous mindset particularly now
what do you mean
the high command is planning to attack andoria
wait wait vulcan and andoria signed a peace treaty two years ago captain archer helped negotiate it
vulcan intelligence claims the andorians are developing a weapon possibly based on xindi technology
you dont believe it
i suspect vlas is using the claim to advance an agenda hes persuaded the high command to launch a preemptive strike
hes going to start an interstellar war
one that could devastate andoria and vulcan and eventually involve other worlds including earth
set a course for andoria
andoria
maximum warp
the andorians have deployed most of their fleet in defensive positions around paan mokar
we gave them that planet when we signed the treaty why would they move their forces there
they believe were preparing to retake it weve been using unmanned probes to generate false warp signatures in that system
why werent we informed of this
its possible that andorian agents have penetrated the high command its necessary to limit access to this information our forces are actually stationed here preparing to launch an invasion of andoria
there are members of the council who are not convinced an invasion is necessary at this time
we know they have the xindi technology youve all seen the data
data can be falsified
we received this sensor telemetry two days ago it was recorded by the andorian ship that stole the xindi prototype
do you have evidence of this
they didnt steal the prototype because they were merely curious im certain of one thing sooner or later the andorians will make use of this technology is it logical for us to wait for that day
weve sent word to the syrrannites in the mountains theyll care for the wounded
how far to the capital
two days
we need to get back to enterprise tell starfleet what weve learned about the embassy bombing
we have a more important mission weve to get this to the capital
i dont understand
the kirshara contains suraks original writings its the only surviving record of his true teachings it would have an enormous impact on the high command and all of vulcan
ive got two teams working on it both launchers should be online in a few hours
anything else
permission to speak freely admiral gardner ordered us to return to earth yet weve set a course for andorian territory
we are going back were just taking a small detour first
have you told starfleet youre planning to warn the andorians
no
have you any idea what the admiral will do when he finds out
ill save you a seat at my courtmartial is there anything else
the vulcans have legitimate reasons for launching this strike if we alert the andorians we will be betraying our closest ally
im trying to prevent a war malcolm a war that earth could get draw into
with all due respect sir we shouldnt get involved
were already involved  come in
thatll be all lieutenant
sir
dismissed
you asked for me commander
ive been thinking theres no guarantee the imperial guards going to believe us weve got no evidence your people are planning this attack but there is one andorian who might trust us at least he does some of the time
commander shran
problem is i have no idea how to find him
i may be able to help
good
lieutenant reed appeared unsettled
some of the crew are wondering if im doing the right thing cant say i blame them im not so sure myself
i have no doubt captain archer would pursue this same course of action
thats what i keep telling myself
enterprise will be scanning for us at the transport coordinates one of us should go there
its too dangerous were staying together
taking the artefact to the high command will accomplish nothing
it might be the only thing that can stop the war
what war
between vulcan and andoria
we settled our dispute with the andorians nearly two years ago
vlas was just stalling for time hes been preparing a largescale attack ever since
where did you get this information
where do you think
assuming for the moment you possess suraks katra hes been dead for centuries how could he be aware of plans for a war
some of syrrans memories must have been transferred in the meld
captain
you think ive lost my mind
im not certain your mind is the one making these decisions we should return to the ship tpau can take the artefact to the capital
i was chosen for this
chosen interesting choice of words
if i were in your shoes id be just as sceptical im not possessed and im not delusional there are forces at work on your world right now trying to undo everything surak taught your people if we fail vulcan will be consumed by them thats why have to get this thing to the capital and im going to need all three of us to try and find
archer dont move
gallicite deposits are you in possession of anything metallic
just this
thanks for the warning
our patrol has returned they captured eight syrrannites from the sanctuary
was syrran among them
no he is dead the syrrannites say that there were three other survivors including a human
archer
they say that he is carrying the kirshara
the kirshara never existed
there are scholars who believe it does and that it was hidden in the forge the syrrannites claim that they are following the true path of surak if the kirshara is real it could prove them right
it doesnt exist youve been listening to syrrannite propaganda that will be all minister
sublieutenant order major talok to find the remaining syrrannites were dealing with radical insurgents theyre to be eradicated do i make myself clear
open a channel
to who
the nebula this is ambassador soval ive come on an urgent mission i must speak with commander shran the high command has decrypted your security protocols were well aware that your task force has been hiding in this nebula
maybe your informations out of date
hes in there
this is commander tucker of enterprise weve got some information youre going to want to hear
sir
were being hailed
commander tucker you have a poor choice of friends
an invasion
thats correct
we keep a very close eye on your fleet we would know if the high command were preparing to attack
vlas has been assembling ships near regulus beyond the range of your listening stations
your leaders may be fools but theyre not suicidal they know we will respond
they were told youre adapting xindi weaponry and that youre planning to use it against vulcan
thats absurd captain archer destroyed the xindi prototype before we could examine it
that fact was conveniently omitted
you people are so used to lying you dont even tell the truth to each other how do i know you werent sent here as a diversion
you dont
do you have any idea what will happen when the imperial guard retaliates it will be a disaster for both our worlds
which is why you must convince them to intercept our fleet
youre betraying your own people by telling me this
im aware of that
why are you doing it
the high command is counting on the element of surprise if they meet resistance i believe vlas will be forced to call off the invasion
when does this invasion begin
soon
thats the best you can give me soon
yes
do you believe him pinkskin
i wouldnt be here if i didnt
ill need to consult with my superiors
i suggest you do it fast
thats the fourth patrol today theres an extensive security grid around the capital its unlikely well get past it
well find a way surak will help us you dont believe in the katra
its irrelevant what i believe the captain could be permanently injured if we dont get him to a doctor soon
he doesnt need a physician he needs a priest one experienced with katras
its irrational that were following someone in his state of mind what if he dies before we can get help i apologise my mothers death has affected me more than i realised
it was a great loss we disagreed frequently but i valued her counsel i could allow you to experience what she shared with me
you melded with her i cannot meld
i would initiate it
thats not what i mean i was forced to participate in a meld several years ago i was infected with a neural disease
panar syndrome do you still suffer from it
theres no cure
another lie perpetrated by the high command panar has been known since suraks time its caused by melders who have been improperly trained one with great experience can correct the neurological imbalance
is there something you can do
my mind to your mind my thoughts to your thoughts our minds are merging our minds are one
bridge to commander shran
this is shran
weve isolated the vulcans biosignature hes alone
youre certain enterprise wont detect the transport
all theyll see is a brief energy surge theyll think it came from the nebula commander
energise when ready
yes sir
welcome aboard ambassador
if youre expecting me to plead for mercy youll be waiting a long time
i simply want to know your fleets actual location
ive already given it to you
then consider this our way of confirming what youve told us you didnt expect the imperial guard to mobilise its entire fleet based on nothing more than the word of one loyal vulcan diplomat
we spent weeks arguing over details in our treaty negotiations did i ever mislead you
no
you must know that torture is rarely effective against vulcans our mental disciplines allow us to suppress pain
our security division has had a great deal of experience extracting information from vulcan operatives this machine doesnt cause physical discomfort it uses a neurosynaptic field to lower your emotional threshold
how do you feel ive seen vulcans who were broken by this device they were never the same again i have no desire to see that happen to you where is your fleet
i told you our ships are assembling near regulus
release me
i cant not until im certain youve told us the truth
then i suggest you increase the setting and get this over with
what is it
the ambassador seems to be missing
hes not in his quarters or anywhere on d deck
tucker to soval ambassador please respond internal sensors scan for his biosigns
hes not on board
scan the andorian ships
theres a vulcan signature on their lead ship
go to tactical alert open a channel this is commander tucker we know ambassador sovals aboard your ship i want to speak with him now
sir the andorians are moving toward the nebula
target shrans ship disable the engines
navigation just went offline
its the particle flux in the nebula its overloading the sensors
ive lost them
can we compensate for the flux
itll take a few hours you have the bridge
captain you need to rest
thanks but ill be fine
the atmosphere is thinner than youre used to if you dont stop soon youll collapse
if you need a break tpol you should say so
im going to scout ahead
have you had any more conversations with surak
not in a couple of hours
somethings amusing
of all the people who couldve carried this katra
i doubt you were syrrans first choice
ever since the meld ive felt more centred its hard to explain my whole life ive never really understood vulcans why they work so hard to suppress their emotions now it all seems to make sense next thing you know ill be taking up meditation
you might find it beneficial
after we get back maybe youll want to take a closer look at the syrrannites philosophy
why
it was important to your mother there might be something to it
there are many groups who claim to follow the true path of surak i find no evidence that this ones any different
i wouldve thought youd be more sympathetic to their cause you never seemed too happy with the status quo around here
i may have had disagreements with the high command but that doesnt mean im going to join a radical faction
you signed up with starfleet a lot of vulcans ive met consider us a radical faction as a scientist i just thought you might want to keep an open mind
this has nothing to do with science
am i interrupting
no
let me out of here
i cant im sorry not yet
ill tear the antennae from your skull
if this interrogation continues your suppression system could be permanently damaged tell me what i want to know
arent you enjoying this commander have you imagined having me in this chair many times
thats not far from the truth but after our rather lengthy peace talks i came to trust you
then trust me now
you would never betray your people
im trying to save them
where is your fleet
do you know the story of nirak
what
he was a soldier who lived a long time ago he was standing watch over the gates of the city of gol and he saw a cloud on the horizon moving toward him he thought it was a sandstorm so he told no one it was an army they destroyed the city but they let nirak live his name now means fool in our language just as yours will in andorian
give the kirshara to us you wont be injured this isnt your world human
archer
surrender and you wont be harmed
im not leaving her
what the hell were you doing
protecting the kirshara
where are they taking the kirshara
mount seleya
why
because the artefact contains suraks original writings only the priests on seleya can translate them
if you are deceiving me
i am a syrrannite we dont lie
i need to rest
if youre attempting to delay us it wont work well find your friends  youve changed i served under you during the tomed mission you dont remember me
thats a very long time ago
you were a fine officer then why did you betray us they must have offered you something or perhaps you enjoy hiding bombs in embassies
we werent responsible
two of my men were killed in the embassy explosion
you have been misled syrrannites are peaceful
i have spared your life because you were once my superior your companions wont be so fortunate
bridge to commander shran
what is it
the general is asking for an update on the interrogation
tell him ill contact him when im ready
acknowledged
you find this amusing
ordinarily i wouldnt but because of this device
there are three higher settings on that panel if i use them
youre afraid to injure me if i were you id leave that detail out of your report to the general
where is your fleet
i was a fool to think youd listen perhaps the high command was right well be better off when andoria falls
report
its the starfleet ship
direct hit to their shield generator
see if you can get a lock on soval
should we return fire
are you going to make enemies of the humans as well
lieutenant order our ships out of the nebula
commander
and tell enterprise well be returning the ambassador shortly
understood
get that thing off of him
theyre heading east away from the capital shes with them where are you going
to find my science officer and i dont want to hear any lectures about the needs of the many i get enough of that crap from from tpol
theres no logic to your plan we have no weapons if they take the kirshara from you theyll destroy it
im going to find her
how is he
youve got a lot of nerve pretending you give a damn
i did what was necessary soval would understand
he should be fine in another day or so
he risked his life coming here and you paid him back by scrambling his neurons
hes not the only one taking a risk i just spoke with the imperial guard theyre redeploying our forces
now you believe him what changed your mind
a lesser man wouldve told me what i wanted to hear even if it wasnt true theres been too much suspicion too many lies on both sides our fleet will intercept the vulcans at these coordinates my superiors believe it may be helpful if enterprise were to join us
sehlat
my first officer where is she what have you done with her
shes been taken to the high command
your technique has improved
welcome home subcommander
i no longer hold that rank
well you may have joined starfleet but youre still vulcan and subject to our laws there are few crimes still punishable by execution but treason is one of them
what is it
seven alien ships have taken position outside the andorian system they are directly in the path of our fleet
are you sure this is wise if the vulcans find us here they might think were siding with the andorians theres no guarantee they wont fire on us
sir im reading a massive subspace distortion
hoshi
its the vulcans theyll be here in two hours hes hailing us again
on screen
our sensors show twelve vulcan cruisers approaching
when will the rest of your fleet get here
they wont arrive in time were on our own
im still not clear how the kirsharas gonna stop a war
vlas cant govern without approval from the council the existence of the kirshara will persuade them to reconsider their support
i dont suppose theyll let us just walk into the high command
we can transport in but well need access codes
i know someone who might have them
the vulcans are powering weapons the andorians are doing the same
travis put us between both fleets if the vulcans want to start a war theyre going to have to get through us first
its shran
commander what do you think youre doing
in case you hadnt noticed they outnumber us two to one
get back in formation
im trying to buy us some time
the andorians have more ships on the way
they wont arrive for several hours
you told us this strike would be a surprise that there would be minimal casualties on both sides the andorians are armed with standard particle cannons there is no evidence of xindi technology administrator we have to call off this attack
our forces are committed we cant turn back
were being hailed by the starfleet ship
this is commander tucker sorry to spoil your surprise but the andorians know what youre planning
i suggest you turn your ships around now
this doesnt concern starfleet
leave the area immediately
i cant do that the andorians helped us when earth was under attack were just here to return the favour
if you side with the andorians youll be fired upon
ive already sent word to admiral gardner if enterprise is destroyed starfleets going to know who is responsible
order our ships to engage the enemy fleet
administrator i cant allow this
sublieutenant
if you attempt to interfere again ill have you arrested
the vulcans theyre locking weapons
on us
no just the andorians
stand by phasecannons dont fire until i give the order
were in the crossfire
hard about get us out of their weapons range
one of the andorian ships is in trouble their reactors been hit
a vulcan cruisers heading towards them
see if you can get their attention
the earth vessels opened fire on one of our ships
destroy them
the cruisers breaking off its attack
were being targeted
evasive starboard full impulse malcolm
were not making a dent in their shields
shrans hailing
tell archer thats two he owes me
contact security
stay where you are
we need to have a talk
administrator it is agreeable to see you again
this woman is an anarchist captain whatever shes told you isnt the truth
tpau didnt bomb our embassy you did
the evidence is conclusive
evidence your people gave us the bombing was an excuse to round up the syrrannites make certain theyd never find this
is that
the kirsharas a myth
hull platings gone
torpedoes
the launchers arent responding
where the hell is shran
the vulcans are keeping him busy looks like we really are on our own
holographic trickery this proves nothing
the artefact must be examined in detail
no
quantum dating will confirm that its from the time of surak
you cant trust her shed do anything to spread her deviant beliefs youve spent years trying to subvert me
the kirshara will show us our true path
theyd kill us all if they had the chance it must be destroyed
this is minister kuvak get me the fleet commander immediately
ive lost helm control
hull breach on g deck were venting atmosphere
the vulcan ships theyre withdrawing
were being hailed its the high command
trip is everything all right
more or less whats going on captain
thereve been a few changes here get back to vulcan as soon as you can
enter captain archer asked me to express his gratitude he wouldnt have succeeded without your transporter codes
the captain told me you were in danger i wouldnt have been a very good husband if i didnt help
im not certain when ill be able to return im aware that i promised your family that we would eventually live together
thats not why ive come im releasing you from our marriage i know you only bonded with me to help your mother shes gone now theres no reason for us to continue
you dont have to do this
i know
koss
goodbye tpol
the katra is with me now
how do you feel captain
like a giant weights been lifted
word has already spread of the discovery it may take years to translate all of the writings
the people of vulcan are in your debt peace and long life
you may be witnessing the start of a new era not only for vulcan but for earth as well
youll no longer have us looking over your shoulder its time for earth to stand on its own
were ready
youve failed decades of work have been lost
am i to be blamed for your incompetence
archer shouldve been killed
you brought the humans into this i must leave vulcan my position here has been compromised
what about me
not now your disappearance would cause suspicion this is simply a minor delay the reunification of our people is only a matter of time
i admit it ive got a few butterflies okay more than a few
you havent stopped talking about this for a week
well its different for you you grew up with the man when i was seven my mom bought me a book about him emory erickson father of the transporter i made her read it to me every night for a month that book is the reason i became an engineer
did i ever tell you about meeting zefram cochrane
yeah only about fifty times
then you know i understand how you feel
you want a mirror
youve got a mean streak in you you know that
nothing seems to be missing
hello emory
jonathan look at you i always suspected youd be famous just didnt think that youd be more famous than me
jon
good to see you
oh we have a lot of catching up to do
do it later i want a tour of this place
my chief engineer commander charles tucker
its an honour
guess you and ill be spending some time together
im looking forward to it
danica trip
i hope you dont mind that im borrowing your ship captain
as long as you return it in good condition
dont know if i can promise that when this test is over enterprise and all of starfleet could be obsolete
sounds like youre trying to put me out of a job
feel like some company we havent talked much since vulcan how are you holding up
ive been fine
ive been seeing you by yourself a lot
im reading the kirshara
how is it
interesting
interesting
extremely
look i know what youre going through losing a family member its the toughest thing there is
i see no point in discussing it its in the past
your mother died a week ago
talking wont change that
it may change the way you feel about it
i dont feel anything about it
you can tell yourself that
its the truth
you know when lizzie died there were times i wanted to just close up retreat inside myself
trip i appreciate what youre trying to do but its not necessary
youre fine well if you ever do want to talk let me know ill see you
subquantum teleportation you step on to a transporter on earth a few seconds later youre on vulcan
thats over sixteen light years
thats just for starters theoretically theres no limit to the distance one of the things were here to test you tell me with that kind of technology whod have any use for a starship
maybe you will put me out of a job
dad
well i wouldnt worry too much its going to take decades to work out all the bugs but when we do starfleets gonna look a hell of a lot different thats if it exists at all
you can see he hasnt changed
i remember you and my father having similar discussions
he believed the future was in the warp drive i believed in the transporter pad i miss those talks i miss him to henry
the vulcan science academy has been studying subquantum transporting for some time with little result
ive been trying to get my hands on some of that research for years in hindsight its probably just as well that i couldnt mightve sent me down the wrong path
its hard to imagine beaming someone that far
all breakthroughs are hard to imagine before they happen when i developed the transporter most people simply couldnt grasp it some still cant
i have to confess given a choice id much rather use a good oldfashioned shuttlepod
ill never forget the protests when the transporter was first approved for biomatter
oh god here we go
people said it was unsafe that it caused brain cancer psychosis and even sleep disorders and then there was all that metaphysical chatter about whether or not the person who arrived after the transport was the same person who left and not some weird copy
which would make all of us copies
i had to fight all of that nonsense and im not going to tell you there werent costs im living proof of that but i won mankind is better off makes everything ive fought for worthwhile
heres to a successful experiment
those early days were pretty terrifying im lucky to be alive
is it true youre the first person to go through
i wasnt about to let anyone else do it
you mustve been scared
terrified that original transporter took a full minute and a half to cycle through felt like a year you could actually feel yourself being taken apart and put back together when i materialised first thing i did was lose my lunch second thing i did was get stone drunk trick i learned from zefram cochrane now there was a man who knew the benefits of a little liquid courage what is it
well youre going to need more juice than i thought
not more than enterprise can spare
well well have to draw direct from the warp reactor may even have to shut down a few systems
youll be able to leave the lights on
yeah if i could get a look at your power converter it might help me out
ill tell you what when im done with this ill install the converter see if i cant make life easier on you
well thanks but when it comes to modifying our systems i prefer to do things myself can i get a look at it
i said id install the converter
and i said no thanks
i wish i had time to debate the finer points of engineering protocol but as you can see im extremely busy and i realise this is your ship and im only a guest but let me remind you that starfleet has granted me complete access to your systems if you hadnt noticed im more than capable of handling a little power upgrade hand me that will you
thats the main reactor and those are the plasma feeds right
you know the ship like a member of the crew
ive read just about everything i could find on her i probably could describe every one of your missions
still wonder why you havent signed on
i think you know the answer
your father seems like he can take care of himself he sure hasnt lost any of his edge
cant argue with that
so why are you still on earth
he needs me he still hasnt gotten over quinn
its been fourteen years
fifteen
he lost a son if you leave hell lose a daughter
if this test goes well itll be a new start for him give him something to look forward to he wont spend all of his time thinking about the past
and if the test doesnt go well
i dont know
we both grew up with fathers who could be pretty demanding
thats an understatement
maybe you should start thinking more about yourself i know its hard taking advice from someone who used to chase you around the backyard with a plastic laser pistol
yeah but its good advice jonathan i just wish i could follow it
how was your tour
i enjoyed it
i can always tell when youre upset you do this like youre in a hurry
dont you think theres something to be upset about
were here thats reason enough to be optimistic
were lying to them
we have no choice
we could talk to jon he might be able to help us
no he wouldnt understand we cant say anything to him we cant trust anyone
its jon
hes a starfleet captain his first duty is to his ship
you talk about him like hes an enemy
hes not an enemy but hes not on our side either believe me
its from over there
no
ill take up you take down
it could be a form of spatial distortion
can you pinpoint it
f deck near the armoury
sickbay crewman down in the armoury
he suffered massive cellular disruption as if hed been subjected to intense delta radiation
did other crewmen see anything
the lights were malfunctioning
this anomaly you detected you think it was somehow responsible
it showed up at the same time in the same location cant have been a coincidence
i sympathise believe me during the initial tests for the transporter some brave men and women were lost not a day goes by that i dont think about them how can i help
youve spent a great deal of time in this region of space
i never encountered anything like this
are you sure
theres a reason this is called the barrens captain theres nothing out here
something out here killed one of my crewmen
i wish i had an explanation for you
what is it
time for my treatment dani sorry  can we continue this later
of course
calm down
you never said that anything like this would happen
i didnt know this would happen
dad a man is dead and were responsible im not going to go along with this anymore
listen to me
no no weve got to tell them the truth
dani youre condemning him to death
im condemning him how do you know he isnt already dead
hes alive
dad jonathans practically family he and quinn were best friends
i know i know that
we cant do this to him to his crew
were almost ready for our first test
someone else could die before then
the odds of that happening again are extremely small no ones going to die i just need a couple of days we owe him that much dani
i wonder what he would have to say about all this about what were doing
when were done you can ask him
routing power  ready
help me up
sir
give me a hand please
this part i like doing myself energising
the probe materialised at the target coordinates
looks like it arrived in good condition
captain were receiving telemetry
were already getting back data congratulations emory
forty thousand kilometres nothings ever gone that far
its a start
its going to take a few hours to gather all the telemetry lets celebrate in mess hall my treat
i like to monitor the data as it comes in im sort of obsessive that way
well then let me bring something back for you help pass the time between data streams
no thanks
its been a long day you must be starving
you go ahead ill join you later
you sure you dont want a second pair of eyes
one pair will do and no offence commander but i work much better when im not being distracted
you know where to find me
come in
somethings wrong most of the work emory had me do tapping into the warp reactor for extra power rerouting the plasma flow it wasnt necessary for the test
what are you saying
remember when the lights dimmed
yeah
well he channeled that energy into a feedback loop it wasnt going into the beam
maybe he needs the power for another phase of the experiment
well from what i can tell his subquantum version should use less energy than a regular transporter thats one of the reasons its so brilliant either he was keeping me busy making sure i was looking the other way or this subquantum thing is a smoke screen for something else something he hasnt told us about i wouldnt have picked up on any of it if you hadnt asked me to take a closer look
when i asked emory about the anomaly that killed burrows he claimed hed never heard of anything like it
not true
something very similar appeared on emorys research ship five years ago tpol dug up the report from starfleets data banks a crew member saw it said it seemed to be alive
bridge to captain archer
go ahead
were picking up another one
its on c deck section five
on my way
its fluctuating
whats your best guess
ive lost it
take section three take section four dont let it touch you
this way it should be here
its highly unstable surrounded by a subspace field
youre fortunate you didnt have more prolonged contact
can you put that down for thirty seconds
i took visual readings
can you slow it down
hold it enhance a little more
who is it
its quinn emorys son
thats incredible he hasnt aged a day
emory
im not here to test a new transporter im here to bring back my son
what are you talking about
we were conducting first trials my greatest achievement quinn wanted to be the first to go through he was a lot like his old man a lot like you i lost his signal and couldnt get it back truth is the subquantum transporter is a fundamentally flawed concept itll never work not now not a thousand years from now i suppose i knew that at the time
you let him go through with the test
i was a relatively young man who had created something that changed starfleet after an achievement of that magnitude there was nowhere to go but down my life became just one long struggle to recapture past glory
im not talking about you im talking about quinn
i wasnt thinking of the consequences
you said you came here to get him back
this region the barrens is actually a subspace node a bubble of curved spacetime its why there are no stars quinns transporter signal is trapped here at certain intervals there are fluctuations in the node that cause the signal to reappear if we can lock onto it at one of those intervals we can save him
you couldve told me all of this before
starfleet would never have authorised the mission i had to create an excuse
a member of my crew is dead
i didnt know that the manifestations would be dangerous believe me
you want me to believe you
i want you to help me quinn was like a brother to you
you were like my second father you shouldve trusted me
all i need is one more scan i can bring him back
is that the truth
im not lying
youve been lying to me since you came aboard
i had no choice im sorry please help me jonathan help me save my son please
i want you both to work with emory give him whatever help he needs what is it trip
i cant believe im hearing this weve already lost one man
it wont happen again well alert the crew to the danger
if theyd been alerted twenty four hours ago burrows might be alive
we dont fully understand the nature of these manifestations they could pose other dangers
i know theres a risk were talking one more day thats all emory needs
what he claims he needs
i believe him
because hes a friend of the family
thats not why im doing this
why are you doing this
quinns signal is getting weaker trip its been decaying for the past fifteen years emory says if we dont do something now well never get him back in one piece we have a responsibility to help
what about emorys responsibility he lied to get us out here
im aware of that but were here we cant just turn the ship around and leave a man to die you have your orders i suggest you get started
were still getting a spike in the array i could swap out the emitter coils with something from engineering might even out a bit
sounds good
ill get on it
i know you dont approve of what ive done
you need my approval
im disappointed that you think less of me
you liked me better when i worshipped your shadow
yes its an honest answer
id think youd be out of practice
you may want to reserve judgment on my actions until youve lost a son
i have lost someone close and id do almost anything to get her back except put other people in danger
quinn and i used to argue all the time wasnt until i lost him that i realised that those arguments were some of the happiest moments of my life
ill be in engineering
can i come in hey there you must be porthos ive heard a lot about you  hes got a lot of personality
and an appetite to match
i wanted to say that im sorry i shouldve come to you earlier i feel responsible you lost a crewman
we cant change whats happened maybe some good can come out of it
you think we can get him back
i think that its possible thats enough reason for me to try
i wonder what it must be like for him you know is he in pain is he conscious if he is does he think that weve forgotten about him quinn was everything to my father to both of us getting him back is all that weve thought about for the past fifteen years
lets hope when this is over youll have something else to think about
the power conversion tables some of these modifications should help
thanks
is there anything else
no i think were pretty much there  im trying to decide what to show for movie night
movie night
yeah i thought id fire up the old tradition you in the mood for a horror film or a musical
i dont think ill have the time for either
you cant spend every second of your life studying that whatever its called
kirshara
you got to take a break eventually
eventually
i dont get you tpol i thought you joined starfleet so you could interact a little more with humans but it seems to me that ever since we left spacedock you spend all your free time cooped up in your room reading that bible of yours
i may have found new priorities
whats that supposed to mean
im needed on the bridge
tpol to captain archer
archer
i picked up something that was in your area but ive lost it
keep monitoring
hes here
jonathan there
quinn quinn
it knocked out an eps junction repairs going to take a couple of hours
will it affect the transporter
no i cant believe youre still going through with this
were not going to have this argument again
that thing barely missed a stack of torpedoes if it had jumped two feet to the left we wouldnt be here to talk about it we should concentrate on repairing the ship so we can get out of here
if we beam quinn aboard there wont be any more of these manifestations
how the hell do you know
trip
youre putting your personal feelings before the safety of this ship
and you are this close to insubordination
insubordination
ive made a decision its the right decision and the discussion is over can you accept that now go do your job
yes sir
i got what i needed you should be able to get a good lock when he reappears
when will that be
just over three hours hows your ship
were ready
you saved my life
forget it
you didnt deserve any of this jonathan im sorry this became your problem
lets make it worthwhile lets get quinn back
im scared
i dont blame you
ive waited so long for this moment planned for it what if something goes wrong what if i fail
on the day before i entered flight training i asked my father pretty much the same thing
what did he say
dont fail
henry never was a poet
he didnt need to be
any moment now
tpol
nothing
captain
go ahead
b deck section eight
confinement beam widest possible spread
way ahead of you got a lock on something patterns good
let me
energising
we need more power
thats all we got
its working
quinn
no no
complete the transport sequence
i dont have a strong enough signal
recalibrate the confinement beam
that wont help get us a lock
just do it
im reading massive cellular deterioration
thats not possible
hes losing cohesion if he materialises hell die in seconds
i can reverse the damage by crossphasing the stream
the transporter cant do that
i built the damn thing
im losing his vital signs
emory
get away from me tie in the secondary buffers
theres not enough time
dad
i can hold the pattern just do it
dad let him go
no
theres nothing you can do for him
i cant let him go i cant
emory you cant save him
im sorry quinn
oh quinn
dad whats wrong
quinn please forgive me please
what is it what
come in
i couldnt leave him like that its better to be alive or dead not somewhere in between
if it means anything my guess is quinn would feel the same way
i came here to bring my son home i suppose i accomplished my goal
ive been in contact with starfleet
i imagine theyre not too happy with all of this
im sure theyll take your achievements into consideration
i perpetrated a fraud to obtain the use of your ship a member of your crew is dead theres no way im going to avoid the consequences theres one good thing to come out of this dani wont have to worry about taking care of me anymore i managed to let go of one of my children now i guess its time for me to let go of the other one
i always thought she should be out here
maybe theyll put me somewhere where ill be useful get a chance to teach
youd probably be good at it
i wouldnt be boring why settle for making myself miserable when i can spread the misery around to an entire class of students
your neurolytic enzymes are at the same level they were a week ago no sign of panar syndrome
its still difficult for me to accept
you were diagnosed with an incurable disease now its gone its a big adjustment from what ive been reading similar diagnoses are taking place all over vulcan people with panar are coming forward its no longer a stigma
the kirshara is having an enormous impact
its clearly had an impact on you you seem more certain of yourself
ive never felt less certain
youre reexamining your core beliefs something most people never do
do you have a moment
sure something tells me youre not here to talk about movie night
im going through something thats very complicated
i know
im learning it seems for the first time what it truly means to be vulcan
well maybe you can fill me in
not until i understand it myself i dont think therell be time for
what do you want me to say
that you understand
i do its not like i didnt know this was coming  at least my warp engines still need me
safe journey
and you jonathan commander
an honour working with you some suggestions this might boost your transporter range a few hundred kilometres
couldnt resist
ill check it out
say goodbye to porthos
good luck
maybe ill see you around
youll win in eight moves
youre really starting to get a feel for the game
thirty two pieces sixty four squares its not as if its difficult the total number of possible outcomes is limited
ten to the one hundred twenty third power
thats what i mean chess is so predictable im surprised anyone bothers to play it
their average life spans only about a hundred years with no time to play all the possible games
what a waste
careful no emotional involvement
i know the rules observation without interference
youll win in five moves
im the ships champion i win all the tournaments
how do you think theyll react to whats on this planet
well thats what were here to find out but in my experience all physical species are alike i dont expect humans will be any different
do you think our hosts will die tonight
its possible for some of the species that have come here ive seen the whole crew die for others only a few
but somebody always dies
always
your move
i cant wait to get back
two days ago you couldnt wait to get off the ship
sifting through a klingon garbage dump not my idea of exploring strange new worlds
getting tired of exploration ensign all the planets starting to look alike
not a chance sir
i didnt think so  i feel like im still breathing dirt shuttlepod one to enterprise
welcome back how did your treasure hunt turn out
well nothing worth bringing home the klingons mustve been here years ago all they left was an old power cell and a bunch of empty ration packs
and a latrine
yeah a long hot showers looking pretty good shuttlepod one out
commander whats wrong
take over
got to dock
shuttlepod one to enterprise
i have a medical emergency commander tuckers collapsed
can you bring the shuttlepod in
yes sir at least in simulations
slow and steady ensign ill see you in decon
understood
call phlox
trip how you feeling
like ive been gutpunched by a tellarite
doctor should we start with the biogel
not until we know what were dealing with three other landing parties returned from the surface with no ill effects
we need to check out the shuttlepod too see if any of its environmental systems were at fault
i can do that captain i shouldve thought of that myself
stay where you are trip phlox needs blood samples
heres the medkits
hoshi what is it
before commander tucker passed out he started coughing
are you feeling any other symptoms
im going to guess thats a yes
ill prepare antinausea medication you get me those blood samples as soon as you can
anything
whatevers afflicting them its not showing up on the standard scans
doesnt sound good
its not
i studied your report on how the klingons reacted to the infection
their response was typical for a species at their level of development
the klingon commander didnt let his landing party back on his ship
your point
captain archer did
captain archers done nothing different from the klingons the launch bay and decon chamber are completely isolated from the rest of the ship
so it doesnt matter if an infected landing party comes aboard
precisely humans dont want to interact with dying crew mates any more than klingons did if it was left to me id stop our observations immediately we have nothing more to learn from humans
oh i dont know theyre showing concern for each other the cardassians did that when they were here didnt they
ah but in the end they killed their infected crew just as the klingons did the only difference is the time it took to reach that decision
maybe the humans will surprise us
ive been observing aliens for eight hundred years ive yet to be surprised still we should follow protocol start questioning the infected crew ill check in with the doctor
okay this is for nausea muscle pain and a cough suppressant
im not coughing anymore neither are you maybe were getting better
well doctors orders
commander hoshi just wanted to say hi
were a little busy right now travis
can you tell me whats in the hypospray
something for our symptoms
yeah phlox doesnt know whats wrong with us yet
have either of you faced serious illness before
arent you supposed to be on duty
i was curious to know how youd compare this experience with other illnesses you mightve contracted
travis we really need to get some sleep
i only have a few more questions
thanks for stopping by
but
lieutenant reed something i can do for you
headache
of course just a moment
are these are the blood tests for commander tucker and ensign sato
thats correct
im not detecting any vascular involvement
your headache not a bad one i take it
no not yet although it feels like it could get worse preventive measure a lot to do today
mild analgesic it is
doctor im curious to know how you think these tests will help you develop an effective treatment
so am i
i mean are you approaching this strictly on a symptomatic level or do you believe theres any similarity to other conditions youve seen in the past
lieutenant i believe i can put your mind at ease if your colleagues have returned with a contagious illness there is no way it can spread to the rest of the ship we are all quite safe
im not worried about that no im interested in the methodology
out out out i have a lot to do as well
you ever see the andromeda strain
strain of what
no its a movie midtwentieth century
let me guess doctor andromeda builds a monster and it kills him in the end
its about an extraterrestrial disease
all your movies are the same i cant keep the stories straight
this reminds me of my dorm room at starfleet training got into a lot of trouble at old stc
i got kicked out
well you cant stop there
in my second month i had a difference of opinion with the company commander i broke his arm
can i ask why
poker
you broke his arm playing cards
he tried to shut down a game i was running for some of the recruits and a couple of the training staff
hold on you ran a floating poker game at stc
the way the regulations are worded gambling was an honour violation only if it took place during duty hours so i ran the game on weekends one night my cc showed up tried to sweep all the chips off the table and i well i have a black belt in aikido i think he was just upset that i hadnt invited him to play
what happened
i got a bad conduct discharge
how the hell did you end up on enterprise
starfleet needed language specialists more than they needed to make an example out of me they let me back in on probation and here i am
the closest classification it matches is a virus highly contagious siliconbased
this is an m class planet all life forms down there should be carbonbased
i can only surmise the virus was brought here perhaps by a meteorite which could explain why only one of our landing parties encountered it
is there a treatment
theres no record of anything like it in the denobulan database
then its up to you
ill do all i can captain but at the rate the pathogen is reproducing commander tucker and ensign sato have less than five hours to live
the doctor identified the pathogen
that happens thirty seven percent of the time
but no ones made the decision to abandon the infected crew members
then thisll likely be one of the times when everyone dies
travis if thats you again
its me
next time i ask to go on a landing party talk me out of it okay
youre usually too stubborn to be talked out of anything but ill do my best hows hoshi
sleeping whatever phlox gave us at least its helping with the pain
phlox identified whats causing all the trouble a siliconbased virus
i dont suppose hes on his way over here with the cure
hes working on it so is tpol
so there is no cure
not yet
im getting the idea youre up against a deadline
if you mean how much time do you have its too early for that kind of talk your own immune system could knock this thing out
i remember exobiology 101 captain humans are carbonbased our immune system cant fight silicon
dont you give up on me
there are still a bunch of planets out there we havent seen
get some rest
were looking for signs of elevated intelligence in the species we observe
rational intelligence yes which archer has not demonstrated the longer the infected crew remain on board the greater the risk that quarantine will fail
im sure captain archer knows exactly what the risk is maybe its not as important to him as standing by his crew
its just as probable that he hasnt realised how hopeless the situation is
theres a way to be sure
we chose the helmsman and the armory officer for good reason theyre both stationed on the bridge yet neither plays a critical role in a medical emergency
which is why we should inhabit the doctor and the science officer archer relies on their findings to make his decisions we could witness that as it happens
the more people we inhabit the greater the chance that we will inadvertently interfere
the more people we inhabit the more well be able to observe
how many languages can you speak
thats not how it works there are a lot of common patterns im just good at hearing them thats all
good youre a genius the way you can pick up an alien language youve never heard before and start spouting it back to them i got to tell you ive always been jealous you can do that
i wish i could fix warp engines with duct tape and a pocket knife
its a bit more complicated than that sometimes
seriously engineering building things have you always been good at that
when i was a kid not so good at building but i was a terror when it came to taking things apart my folks used to put all our kitchen appliances on the highest shelves one thanksgiving i have no idea what i was thinking but i removed every screw from this big dining room table we had it was so old the wood sort of stuck together so it stayed standing until my dad put the turkey down i spent the next month in my room
how old were you
oh twenty four twenty five
how long have they been there
we didnt see you there
we didnt want to interrupt you
hows the research coming
were waiting on new test results
we thought wed see how you two were progressing
youre the ones with the medical scanners
we were more interested in discussing your state of mind
look if you really want to know how we feel wed be a lot better knowing you two were back in sickbay working on the cure for this
of course were going there now
commander ensign
they both came to see us maybe that means theyre almost finished
yeah unless theres nothing more they can do
theyre very brave the way theyre facing death
their courage isnt at question their intelligence is
you want the humans to fail
this isnt a competition either a species intelligence is developed enough for first contact or it isnt
perhaps we should consider other qualities in making our decision
this is the measure we have used for ten thousand years its not our responsibility to change it
then whose responsibility is it
there if phlox is right about the virus coming here on a meteorite that crater might be the source of it which means the klingons at this campsite must have been infected too set up a priority channel to starfleet command we need to find out which klingon ship explored this world and whether or not they developed a cure
right away sir
those are the new test results my host is waiting for
we should leave these creatures to their work undisturbed
the helmsman and the armoury officer are back on the bridge
the altered immune receptors werent effective
this could indicate the virus is sensitive to ionizing radiation
at levels that would be fatal to humans but its a start
ill prepare new samples for testing
hoshi hoshi wake up
i was back in brazil the shuttle was coming to take me to enterprise
thats where we are
captain archer needed me early i didnt get the chance to say goodbye to my students
youll see them again
ive heard from starfleet theyre working through diplomatic channels to contact the klingons but it might not be necessary this spectrograph identifies a klingon alloy
thats the signature of standard hull plating
i found it here
youve detected a debris cloud in orbit
its whats left of a klingon shuttlecraft their response to an infected landing party the commander killed his own shuttle crew
they didnt even plead for mercy i mean they wouldnt would they being klingon
captain does knowing what the klingons did help us at all
at least we know we dont have to bother asking them if they have a cure
but if they had developed one youd ask them for it right
on bended knee
yo se que estoy atrasada enterprise no se va hasta manana solo necesito cinco minutos
hoshi were in quarantine for a reason
i have no idea what youre saying but you cant break the lockout code
math is just another language
quarantine breach on d deck the decon chamber has been unsealed
someones overriding the safety interlocks
shut down all power to d deck i want those doors sealed
hoshi you have to stop thats an airlock you open those doors we die
haye nuzhno skazat dosvidaniya
hoshi come on
i need to tell them while theres still time
the captain wont let us down
trip to whoevers out there were back
commander i want you to set your hypospray for three units of sonambutril
that could drop a horse
we cant risk hoshi wandering off again especially since it seems she can override every security safeguard on enterprise
yeah shes full of surprises today
sweet dreams houdini
anything else
its your turn trip
come on captain
commander the virus is incompatible with carbonbased life its attacking your bodies in ways i cant predict
you think im going to wander off too start opening the wrong doors
not if youre sedated
sorry trip
commander
im just wondering if either one of us will ever wake up again
you should lie down right away
i wont argue with that
how close are you to stopping this
tpol and i have isolated a specific frequency of radiation that disrupts the silicon matrix of the virus
sounds promising
unfortunately the dosage required would be lethal
theres got to be some kind of a tradeoff a way to produce enough radiation to slow down the virus without killing the patient
thats what im working on
work faster
we can stop what this virus is doing to them
thats not why were here
we came to observe their response to the unexpected not to watch them suffer
this is not the place to be having this discussion
i know where we can talk undisturbed
the sensations in this host are different from the others im experiencing physical pain
so am i
why should any species have to endure this weakness
because the desire to overcome it will spur them to move beyond the limitations of the physical world
maybe that isnt true for all species
it was true for us
you cant be awake
not with that much sonambutril
our ancestors were physical beings
well what worked for us might not work for everyone humans have different qualities
nothing i havent seen before
what do you have against this species
what disturbs me most about the humans is their capacity for violence
extraordinary
klingons embrace violence the humans try to avoid it
humans say they avoid it but their words dont match
were being observed
captain tpol i was just coming to see you these are brainwave readings of commander tucker and ensign sato
what is the significance
the patterns arent human
did you know they had this capability
he must have used denobulan technology
i see are you responsible for what happened to my patients
we had nothing to do with it
we come here only to study how physical species react to the unknown you can help by telling us how you detected our presence that happens in less than two percent of our missions
commander tucker and ensign sato were sedated they shouldnt have been able to stand and talk
its been so long since we had physical form we werent able to distinguish sleep from sedation
well remember next time
is there anything you can do to help my patients
were here to observe we cant interfere
youre interfering with me
our subjects are human youre denobulan you were inhabited a few hours ago an intriguing experience
i have no recollection of that
memories are simple to adjust
youre going to adjust mine again so i wont remember a word of this encounter
or what you observed in the decon chamber
if you have that ability you must be able to help my patients
we could
but we wont thank you for your help doctor
no wonder you erase memories your behaviour is appalling
according to what i read on the doctors medical padd hes learned how to stop the infection
ive seen seven other species develop the radiation cure but never in time
did we make first contact with any of them
of course not expending resources to attempt an impossible task is not a sign of intelligence the captain and science officer have decisions to make we need to return to our original hosts
for the radiation to destroy the virus without killing the patient it must be precisely focused the emitters in the decon chamber arent suitable but the bioscanner in sickbay is
to move them from decon to sickbay well need to expand the quarantined area
that wont be a problem were going to make this work
ensign satos condition is deteriorating we need to hurry
engaging quarantine
reed to bridge
i confirm a positive seal
environmental systems are isolated
entering the quarantine zone
shes going into oligemic shock captain shes dying
get her on the bioscan bed
shes stopped breathing
someone always dies
hoshi phlox
what are you doing
this equipments not designed for ev gloves
ill be your hands
no captain no
right now enterprise needs a doctor more than it needs a captain
attach the leads twenty centimetres apart
i dont understand
in eight hundred years no ones ever done that before
no not once they know its hopeless
you need to inject
forty units of trinephedrine into her heart no no no no no no no no that cant go deep enough
oldfashioned but effective angle it slightly more to the right now in one quick motion insert it three centimetres
press the activator clear
come on hoshi
three hundred millijoules captain
again
three hundred and forty shes gone captain help me with commander tucker
how many have to die before youll admit humans are different we need to stop this
i will not depart from protocol the incident isnt over when the first death occurs on the ship theres a sixty eight percent chance the rest of the crew will become infected
what more will that teach us about them
all this would have happened whether we were here or not we are not responsible
maybe we should be
we need to move him into the scanner
it didnt work im sorry captain
not your fault doctor
theres nothing more i can do for commander tucker but youve still got a few hours there has to be something else i can try
you should continue your work on the bridge less chance of something going wrong with your suit
i wont give up
you know where to find me
archer to tpol
tpol here captain
i take it youve been watching
i have
then you know youre in command
yes captain
i would like to think youll stay in command dont let admiral gardner sneak in someone over your head
ill do my best
i know you will i need to look after trip now
well talk again well talk again
captain if commander tucker becomes conscious
ill let you know right away archer out
i have such respect for you captain archer
trip
not exactly im an organian a nonphysical lifeform
trip is my host
what did you do to him
nothing we never interfere in the natural development of other species we only observe
did you know about the silicon virus
thats why we come here to see how different species react when they encounter it
you knew about the virus that killed two members of my crew and you didnt warn us
i wanted to but its not up to me
youre breaking every rule we have
because they dont apply to this species
that is not our decision to make
if we dont challenge the rules
i dont care about your rules tell me what happens to trip and hoshi when youre finished with their bodies
we have to leave them as they are
dead i understand why you wont get involved with a species natural development ive faced that decision myself it isnt an easy one to make
then we agree
no we dont our encounter with the virus was an accident one that you could have prevented
then how would we ever learn about you
ask us talk to us just like youre doing now
talking is a limited form of communication for us were much more advanced than humans
not from where im standing maybe youve evolved into beings with abilities i cant comprehend but youve paid a hell of a price youve lost compassion and empathy things that give life meaning and if thats what it takes to be advanced i dont want any part of it
were leaving now captain you wont remember a thing about our presence and in three hours youll die as well
no we have the power to save them all
are you defying me
im defying the entire protocol what archer has done today his act of compassion youve never witnessed that before
in time well study other humans
theres another way experience compassion for yourself you want to know what it means to be human you need to do more than observe
archer to the bridge
tpol go ahead
you wanted to know when trip was awake
yes
well youd better get down here because hes talking up a storm and so is hoshi
captain hoshis
you too phlox maybe one of you can tell me what the hell just happened
youre all completely free of the virus it has to have been a delayed reaction to commander tuckers radiation treatment but how it spilled over to you and hoshi i have no explanation
obviously the pathogens behaviour is more unpredictable than we assumed
im sure someone at starfleet medical will figure it out but for now were going to leave a warning beacon in orbit here and make sure what happened to us never happens to anyone again
you realise the consequences of what weve done we will never be able to observe another species encounter this virus
good im looking forward to making my first report after ten thousand years the rules need to change
these humans have not been a good influence on you i would not encourage further encounters
i dont think we can avoid them im going to recommend that we start preparations for an official first contact mission
indeed at the rate theyre progressing thatd barely give us five thousand years to prepare
then wed better get started
bridge to engineering engineering respond
this is the warship kumari calling imperial command weve been attacked by a tellarite vessel primary systems have failed request immediate
alert warp containment breach in two minutes
tellarite swine they will pay for this this is shran all crew to the escape pods abandon ship
the food on this ship isnt fit for animals that mangy pet of yours would probably taste better you can either take me home or find a new chef its that simple oh something else i want new quarters
is that so
for one thing my room is too small there are plasma conduits running across the ceiling its noisy it keeps me up all night
maybe youd sleep better in the cargo bay
what did you say to me
this is a starship not a luxury liner if youre not satisfied with the accommodations we can leave you behind in a shuttlepod maybe youll have better luck with whoever picks you up and if you dont like chefs food dont eat it from the looks of things you should probably skip the dessert table while youre at it
that was a nice touch
i cant believe im supposed to speak to their ambassador like that
tellarites always have a litany of complaints its how they start arguments with people theyve just met
even if they have nothing to complain about
in that case theyll just insult you whatever they say you have to respond in kind otherwise theyll take offense
a species that actually thrives on arguing they probably make good politicians thanks for the dry run
sir i wasnt kidding about porthos
you think hes mangy
no but you might want to keep him out of sight tellarites consider canines something of a delicacy
everything ready for our guests
well just about but my people are working triple shifts trying to finish that mud bath they wanted
mud bath
apparently the ambassador likes a good soak in the morning something i dont understand these tellarites have warp ships so why do we have to take them to the conference
babels on the far side of andorian space they wont allow tellarite ships to pass through their territory
now were a shuttle service when are we going to get back to exploring
this trade dispute is a little more urgent it could turn into a shooting war if the conference fails
you people are even uglier than i remember captain jonathan archer welcome aboard
ambassador gral
im told this ship is the pride of starfleet i find it small and unimpressive
funny i was about to say the same thing about you
you may show us to our quarters its far too cold in here
were expected to stay on this ship for five days
so he says well im not really a pilot ah you dont get it
warm enough
the ambassador requested the temperature be increased
again
you know i like these people more than i thought i would they dont hold anything back its refreshing speaking your mind for a change
you dont feel free to speak your mind with the rest of us
no you know what i mean
no maybe youd like to explain it to me why dont you change your uniform before you stink up the place
ah practicing your tellarite i get it
when in rome
i beg your pardon
forget it
the ambassador wants to speak with you
what a surprise
have we crossed into andorian space
a few minutes ago
the last time i was here i was on the command deck of one of our cruisers driving those blue demons back into their territory the andorians came to your aid during the xindi crisis
they helped save my planet
so why should we trust humans to mediate this dispute you owe them your lives
earth wants a peaceful outcome just as much as you do that isnt going to happen if we choose sides
your people have no experience in interstellar affairs
it doesnt seem that you have a lot of other options
your chef obviously went to a great deal of trouble
im told these are authentic tellarite dishes
if id wanted to eat like this i wouldve stayed at home i was expecting to sample earth cuisine on this journey
ill have him whip something up
captain archer to the bridge
weve picked up a message on an andorian channel
kumari calling imperial command been attacked primary systems have failed request immediate
thats it
they have no ships within range
how long to intercept them at maximum warp
two hours
alter course contact babel let them know were going to be delayed
judging by the debris pattern id say their reactor breached
im detecting significant quantities of duranium alloy this was most likely an andorian combat vessel
escape pods multiple biosigns
bring them into the launch bay tell phlox to stand by for casualties
this would be easier if youd take a few steps back
i hope youve studied andorian physiology
how many of my crew did you rescue
nineteen
our complement was eighty six
your distress call said you were attacked
tellarites we were escorting our ambassador to the trade conference when they dropped out of warp the ambassadors ship was destroyed in seconds tellarites crippled us with their next shot ive never seen one of their vessels manoeuvre like this one while those barbarians have been talking peace theyve obviously been improving their warships
why would the tellarites agree to let earth mediate your dispute if they were planning this strike
perhaps you should ask them i suggest you scan for our data recorder itll contain the sensor logs of the attack
we seem to keep running into each other captain its fortunate enterprise was close by
its not a coincidence were carrying the tellarite delegation
theyre aboard this ship
these arent the people who attacked you
they may know who did
shran
youre on my ship
you better keep them away from us or there will be bloodshed
ive analysed these hull fragments the damage is consistent with tellarite particle cannons
what about the black box
the memory core was damaged but i was able to reconstruct the last few seconds of sensor data
tellarites set course for andoria best speed
these accusations are absurd we had nothing to do with this alleged attack
the andorian sensor logs look them over yourself
logs can be fabricated
you saw the debris field
for all we know they destroyed the ship themselves andorian technology is more advanced than ours one of our cruisers wouldnt stand a chance against two of theirs
i want you to speak to your people find out what you can
i am not comfortable with so many andorians aboard contact your superiors have them transferred to another vessel
lets get something straight youre just a passenger on my ship i give the orders
where are you taking them
back to andoria
you cant theyll arrest us theyll hold us responsible for this incident
if youre innocent im sure you have nothing to worry about
to the kumari
from what i saw she was a fine ship with a good crew
i was in command for twelve years first ship of her class most of the crew i served with even longer they were more than colleagues i knew their spouses their children im grateful talas survived if id lost her
i didnt realise there was something going on between the two of you
its a recent development in the past i never wouldve considered a relationship with someone under my command
what changed
andorian women are far more aggressive than earth females she made an overture i had a choice charge her with assaulting a superior or mate with her
i hope you made the right decision
i regret that youre drawn into another of our conflicts captain
i seem to have a knack for it
i doubt that war can be avoided this time when that sensor data is seen by imperial command
it doesnt make sense why agree to a conference then attack your ambassador
tellarites dont think like you or i do theyve been provoking us for months weve lost six freighters along the border we know theyre responsible
tellarites claim theyve lost ships of their own
youd accept their word over ours
tpol to captain archer
go ahead
theres a ship on an intercept course its andorian
you expecting company
hail them
theyre not responding
im reading a power buildup theyre opening fire
what the hell are they doing
our warp fields destabilising were dropping to impulse
call them off
let me talk to them this is commander shran of the imperial guard call off your attack
my crew is aboard this ship do you hear me abort your attack
phase cannons return fire
no damage
we need to get through their shields how theyre going to kill all of us if you dont do something
i need to access your targeting array
these are the coordinates to their shield generator
fire when ready
direct hit
their shields are still at maximum
impossible
shran
our dorsal platings almost gone
starboard thrusters are down
torpedoes maximum yield
theyre moving off
theres a fluctuation in their power grid
good work
that wasnt my doing sir i didnt target their power grid
your government asked us to be a part of a conference and now youre attacking us
this makes perfect sense captain they sent a distress call to lure you into a trap
we have no argument with starfleet
your people tried to destroy this ship
captain i assure you what happened does not represent the will or intent of my government
are you implying the imperial guards been disloyal
i dont have to imply anything the facts speak for themselves
that may not have been an andorian ship
what
its shield matrix had a completely different configuration
what is that supposed to prove
several of our warships have been reported missing over the years the tellarites could have taken one of them enhanced its systems
hes suffering from paranoia captain
im not paranoid your people are trying to kill us
ive had enough of your lies
thats enough you want to fight ill throw both of you in the brig you can tear each other to pieces
what happened
archer claims to be impartial but its obvious hes inclined to believe the andorians we may have made a mistake in trusting these humans
theyve posted soldiers outside our quarters were prisoners on this ship have you stopped to consider archer may be conspiring with the andorians
tpols found something youre going to want to see
we retrieved this from your ships data recorder this is the power signature of the vessel that destroyed the kumari this signature belongs to the andorian ship that attacked enterprise
theyre identical
that cant be correct
examine the data yourself
your sensors are unsophisticated theres been a mistake
weve confirmed the data
what are you suggesting that these two vessels are actually the same ship
i dont know what im suggesting but we need to keep our minds open
the tellarites have violated every accord weve made with them they cant be trusted your desire for a peaceful resolution is blinding you from the truth
commander perhaps
ive heard enough from you vulcans are expert liars perhaps your people are behind this
youre speaking to my first officer
tucker to the bridge
go ahead
warp engines will be online in ten minutes well have hull plating back within an hour
keep me updated
weve located the warp trail of the ship that attacked us were going to follow it
some of my crew are in serious condition they need attention from our physicians
itll take four days to get to andoria by then that shipll be long gone
something wrong with your meal
just not hungry do you think were moving too fast
commander tucker believes its safe to maintain this warp factor
thats not what i meant earths got a lot riding on the outcome of these talks but im not sure we knew what we were getting into these people have been feuding for over a century maybe we shouldve let your government handle this
although our relations have improved recently its clear the andorians dont trust us
aside from breathing oxygen it doesnt seem to me that andorians and tellarites have a hell of a lot in common
the same has been said about humans and vulcans
hoshi tells me you got a transmission from vulcan this morning
it was a personal message it was from koss our marriage has been officially dissolved
im sorry to hear that
you have nothing to apologise for
bridge to captain archer
archer
i believe weve found the andorian ship sir
were on our way
report
i have been unable to locate the malfunction
then i suggest you double your efforts this is enemy territory we cant remain here any longer without
theres a vessel approaching
show me
you said you found the andorians
i dont understand it sir the warp trail ends right here
their primary systems are offline
hail them
no response
biosigns are indeterminate
magnify any idea what the spikes are
they appear to be subspace transceivers
why would they need so many
their hull is also lined with multispectral emitters
for what purpose
i prefer not to speculate
find out who these people are take a team of macos with you
their life supports offline
bring trip along see if he can get it working
you two start down there
yes lieutenant
this whole sections depressurized
lets hope the rest of this ship isnt as cramped
i cant read anything through these bulkheads
stay alert
the propulsion matrix still isnt functioning
how much longer
the repairs are underway
prepare to overload the core
what
if we cant repair the matrix in time ill do whatever is necessary to keep it away from starfleet
tucker to enterprise
go ahead
we havent run into any welcoming parties yet weve found a computer interface
but theres no power over here im going to need tpols help to bring it online
uplink your scanner
whats happening
i didnt do anything
sir
evasive maneuvers get our people back
captain were ready to come home whenever you are
theyve reinforced their hull plating
we can only transport one at a time
take carender and myers first
one of the macos is aboard  theyve hit our eps couplings
switch to auxiliary  target their weapons only
were losing hull plating
transporters offline
did we get everyone
just the macos
tpol
the primary phase coil is fused itll take several hours to repair it
decompression on c deck section three
we have to withdraw
archer to trip
weve lost the transporter
understood
sit tight until we come back for you
well be fine sir
get us out of here travis maximum warp
theyre retreating
pursuit course
trip
youre down to eight minutes
thanks were not going to get very far only sharing your supply
ill try to get their life support online
right with our luck they probably breathe fluorine
warp four point nine
theyre still closing
warp five
theyve matched our speed
lets see what those new injectors can do
five point oh two point oh four five point oh six
theyre falling behind
the injectors stabilised were holding speed
maintain your heading
youre going to wear out the deck plating commander
gral knows more about these attacks than hes admitting how can archer be so blind
we have no choice but to let him deal with the situation
im not going to entrust the security of andoria to the pinkskins or anyone else we trusted the tellarites once we wont make that mistake again with the appropriate persuasion gral will talk
i doubt archers capable of a thorough interrogation
then ill have to question him myself
there are guards outside our quarters we dont even know what deck the ambassadors on
can you bypass their security protocols
any luck
i cant find anything that even looks like an atmosphere recycler im starting to wonder if this ship even has life support
they must have atmosphere on their bridge
well lets hope they dont mind sharing
the starfleet ship has moved out of sensor range
the humans have seen too much we cant allow them to escape
this vessel is a prototype i told you it wasnt ready for combat
find them
come in
i analysed the data commander tucker sent back the ship doesnt appear to be tellarite or andorian
do we have any idea who built it
theres a remote possibility its power matrix utilises boridium cells we encountered a similar technology more than two years ago
the romulan minefield but the power cells on those mines were much larger and more primitive
i did say it was a remote possibility
if this is a romulan ship why would they be stirring up trouble so far from home
they have been known to act aggressively against species they see as a threat
weve never threatened them as far as i know neither have the andorians or tellarites maybe theyre afraid of something else the species in this region have a history of not getting along this conference couldve been the first step in changing that
you believe they fear an alliance
the conference has been postponed indefinitely it doesnt sound like theres going to be an alliance any time soon anything from trip
were still too far away to detect a comm signal
well keep me updated
another access tube
im starting to wonder if this ship even has a bridge
yeah
your airs down to twenty six minutes malcolm
perhaps its on one of the lower levels theres no rule that says the bridge has to be at the top of the ship
you see these data conduits chances are they converge on the bridge
so i understand our first officers no longer married
yeah
well i was wondering what your intentions were
well who are you her father
no simply curious
malcolm weve got something
what is it
a maneuvering thruster
perhaps theyll be kind enough to give us the specs
its chemically fuelled liquid hydrogen and oxygen
we could refill our tanks
can i help you
i was hoping we could talk i doubt youre aware of this how could you be
andorian women are permitted one final conquest before their wedding ive never had relations with a member of your species i was hoping youd indulge me
go back to your quarters
you wont even consider it
what is it
theres a problem with one of the liquid fuel tanks
another malfunction
no the starboard transfer valve has been opened manually
activate internal sensors
how are you holding up
a little lightheaded
thats nothing new i shouldve known better
about what
getting involved with a fellow officer theres nothing going on between us anymore if youre interested
thats not why i asked
well you said she had an awfully nice bum
this is true
pure oxygen be my guest
thanks
 hold magnify that image humans
if they make their way to the bridge
are the inertial stabilisers offline
they are
evasive manoeuvres
magnetise your boots
we mustnt be
what is this
i want to know why my ship was attacked and then youre going to answer for your crimes against my people
what did you find
weve discovered the function of the emitters on their hull
theyre holographic projectors its a camouflage system they can use it to mimic the appearance of almost any ship
malcolm analysed the andorian debris he said that ship was destroyed by tellarite weapons
their disruptor utilises triphasic emitters they can simulate different kinds of weapons
the one thing they couldnt mask is their power signature thats why they
security to captain archer
go ahead
theres weapons fire on g deck outside the tellarites quarters
on my way get the macos down there seal off g deck
we know your governments behind the disappearance of our freighters
we had nothing to do with that
you may have been able to convince archer but im not so gullible i dont know a lot about starfleet weapons but i believe this setting will bore right through that thick hide of yours the truth now
stay out of this pinkskin
shran listen to me the ship that attacked you wasnt tellarite
i was there
i can prove it was someone else
youre both being set up your ship was attacked because someone didnt want this conference to go forward
who
im asking you one captain to another look at the evidence before you do something youre going to regret
get phlox down here
how bad
its only superficial youll be fine
the bridge should be through there
theyve entered the bridge
they wont last much longer
itll have to wait were approaching our next target
stabilise the drone for battle activating the holographic skin
use this configuration
you still in one piece
feel that were dropping out of warp
target acquired
engage visual sensors
the rigelians are hailing us
answer them
were firing at someone
well brace yourself whoever it is theyll be sure to fire back
the drone is taking damage
give the rigelians time to send their distress call now destroy them
it was a heavilyarmed scoutship with a crew of seventeen there were no survivors
why does starfleet think this is connected to the other incidents
rigelians transmitted a visual record of the ship that attacked them
im told their trade commission is demanding compensation and my arrest whoevers behind these attacks theyre trying to do more than provoke a war between andorians and tellarites this is an attempt to destabilise the entire region we need to find the marauder before it attacks again
ive found a way to detect their warp signature and travis designed a sensor grid that should extend our range
how many ships will it take to make this work
only one hundred and twenty eight
theres just one way we can get that many ships to help us
talas
have you come to take me home
i think this denobulan doctor is secretly in love with you he wants to keep you to himself
you said my wound was superficial
you were only grazed but the phase pistol was set to kill
that tellarite pig
is there any other kind
ive seen what phasepulse infection can do to andorians
youre going to be fine well be home soon the two of us
dont let me die unavenged
i wont
im sorry she needs to rest
see what i mean he cant get enough of you im jealous
doctor
how is she
lucky to be alive
i have a proposal
if it involves killing tellarites im all for it
your ship is adrift in enemy space damaged and defenceless because of a single rigelian scoutship is that what you want me to report to the senate
the drone has taken damage before its designed to selfrepair
if our enemies find it
thats the point of this project no prisoners to capture no bodies to recover these drone ships can never be traced back to us
this prototypes a modified warbird the vulcans would identify it the moment they inspected the propulsion matrix
the vulcans wont get anywhere near it
dont underestimate our distant brothers bring your ship home ill tell the senate that your test has been a success otherwise theyll make someone pay for this failure
and i promise you it wont be me jolan tru admiral
come in
admiral gardner just called hes sending every ship available but at top speed itll take weeks for most of them to get here
what about columbia
shes stuck in dry dock engine trouble did you get through to your people
minister tpau is dispatching twenty three vessels
thats all
the high command has been disbanded many of our ships no longer have full crew compliments
tpau could have picked a better time to clean house
andorian and tellarite fleet deployments
im thinking of asking them to join us without more ships our sensor nets going to have a gaping hole the marauder could fly right through it and wed never know
have you discussed this with commander shran or ambassador gral
not yet
even if both sides were to agree which seems unlikely their deployments would have to be coordinated a command hierarchy established
an andorian captain might have a problem taking orders from a tellarite
precisely
theres one species thats on friendly terms with both of them humans enterprise could serve as the command ship relaying all orders the other ships would only have to exchange communication codes
it might work
you dont sound too optimistic
these have four species have never cooperated on a mutual endeavour
as far as i know no ones ever tried to get them together before from what ive heard about these romulans they mean business if theyre behind these attacks we have to find some way to stop them or next time they might come back with a thousand of those ships
some of these circuits are live but i dont know what theyre for
and i cant figure out what half this stuff is
what about the other half
well i think i found an environmental system
thatd make sense these consoles look like crew stations
here goes
well how about that in a few minutes well have heat and air
do you think its possible that theres no one else on board
why would a robot ship have a bridge like this
it could be a prototype outfit an existing ship with the latest in computer controls
well thatd make things a whole lot easier for us
hows that
if this ships run by computer what we need to do is find the off switch
id rather cohabit with klingon targs than join forces with tellarites
your personal mating preference is no concern of mine
if youre waiting for me to stop you dont worry i wont
you heard what he said
and i heard what you said so now its time for both of you to listen to me instead of insulting you to make you feel at home and putting up with your arrogance as a sign of my respect why dont the two of you try behaving like humans for a change
and you said you wouldnt be insulting
theres one thing humans seem to do better than any species weve met when were faced with a common threat we put our differences aside and try to cooperate someone is determined to start a war in this region ive shown you how we can stop them but if you dont understand that feel free to strangle each other just remember thats exactly what this marauder wants you to do
weve gone back to warp
just when it happened i got a power spike from one of these conduits
do you think warp control runs through here
if this ship was originally built for a crew all of its controls should connect to the bridge maybe they never got disconnected keep your eyes on these consoles
did you do that
even money we just found their propulsion controls
what are they doing
i cant tell for sure visual surveillance is offline the drone is dropping out of warp
youve found the off switch
all i did was interrupt the power to the warp controls theres probably a backup thatll switch on in a few minutes
can you make any sense of this
wheres hoshi when you need her
thats where we are
im going to guess thats the power circuit i just shut down
if this were enterprise thatd be the power coupling for the entire warp control system including the backups
should be right through there
maestro
one of thems left the bridge hes in the service junction
why
it appears hes located the main coupling for the warp matrix
what else is in there
just what we need to kill him
okay malcolm im going to flip through these like circuit breakers let me know how the diagram changes
ready when you are
theres the first one
it went out
hes disabling the warp system
is selfrepair still activated
itll take more than a day to reroute the major circuits
we dont have a day
one of them is still in the service junction
seal him in
im going to see if theres a communications circuit we can tap into
malcolm  malcolm did you touch something
wasnt me
do the hatch controls work on your side
negative theyre not responding
listen carefully and you wont be harmed
who are you
i control the ship
not anymore you dont
commander whats happening
reactor coolant radiations at a hundred roentgens and climbing
that gives you seven minutes commander reestablish the warp matrix or you will die
compliments of the imperial guard these are the communication codes well use for the joint operation
grals informed me that the tellarites are also taking part so theyll need these codes as well
do what you have to
i appreciate your cooperation
youre not especially difficult to work with captain unlike tellarites you understand ethics and try to live by them
try
well nobodys perfect have you served on all these vessels
a few of them are a bit before my time but they were all named enterprise this one sailed earths oceans almost four hundred years ago
my vessel the kumari was named for the first icecutter to circumnavigate andoria perhaps future ships will be named after our vessels especially if we do something historic together
theres no reason our people cant become allies
agreed
pay attention to that board malcolm im going to try to cut power to the reactor
ive got a better idea make sure youre well away from the door
youre wasting time commander the radiation will be fatal in three minutes
i can save you
malcolm what happened to the board
everythings off
thats more like it radiations falling
theyve taken the reactor offline
activate the backup sequencer
im still in control there is nothing you can do to save your life
except follow my instructions
weve received the final confirmations all one hundred and twenty eight ships are in position
phlox to captain archer
go ahead
i require you in sickbay as soon as possible
no
i did everything i could
you said shed recover
shran
no
commander whats your status
i shouldve brought my helmet radiations at one eighty and climbing i cant shut it down
you dont have to die like this
youre not getting this ship back
youre wrong commander
eventually it will repair itself
youll have died for nothing
all right ill reconnect the matrix open the hatch
malcolm no thats an order
commander
do your duty malcolm
restore the matrix save your commanders life
there every tellarite ship is connected to your sensor network despite the inefficient andorian codes
now comes the hard part we have to sit and wait
were not a patient people
ive noticed maybe thats something we can work
i only want to talk to him i only want to talk
were listening
you  need to know about talas the woman you killed
she attacked us
the attack was over when you shot her but im not here to argue that her family was privileged her parents wealthy she couldve chosen any career never known discomfort but she felt the call of duty she pledged her life to the imperial guard talas couldve had anything anyone she chose me i just wanted you to know
its her blood when a guardsman dies far from home his companions her companions carry part of her back to the ice of andoria i wanted you to know that too
before you die
thats enough
not until his blood pays for hers
keep him away
you will face justice at my hands
thats not going to happen on my ship
yes it will pinkskin because if you and the tellarites dont show respect for andorian tradition the imperial guard will withdraw its ships
what tradition
unless this murderer meets me in combat your precious alliance is finished
im reconnecting the warp matrix
shut off the radiation
when youre finished
there now shut it off and open this hatch
commander stay with me
the matrix has been reactivated
then we dont need the humans anymore
why didnt you listen to me
were better off here than on the bridge
take it to warp set a course for home
were back at warp i ordered you not to help them
i apologise for saving your life commander it wont happen again
sorry
according to the bridge schematic this is an access panel
wheres it lead
away from the bridge
what does that give us
we should assume that were being monitored did you ever read the manual that came with that thing
the warning about inadvertent overload
how long does it take
by now less than a minute
what access panel are they talking about
it leads into the superstructure away from any critical equipment
well deal with them when the drone returns
weve got to be a safe distance by now
i wired it directly into the power conduit
weve lost contact
the andorian tradition shran wants to follow is called the ushann basically its a duel to the death
the combatants fight with these
its called an ushanntor
its an iceminers tool andorians play with them as children a tellarite wont stand a chance using one against shran
i dont think thats going to be an issue ambassador grals refusing to let naarg fight
andorians will consider that a further insult
what else do we know about this tradition
please make yourself at home an old friend i carry it everywhere
two hours ago we spoke about a new partnership between andoria and earth
a benefit to both our worlds
youre throwing it away for personal vengeance
theres more to this than talas i lost my ship almost my entire crew if i do nothing to avenge these losses what kind of leader am i why should any soldier follow me again besides you should be wishing me luck i provide a voice for your species at the imperial guard im valuable to humans
i spoke to ambassador gral about the rules of the ushann specifically the right of substitution
the ambassadors decided to fight in place of his underling
not the ambassador
you wouldnt
im the substitute youre going to have to fight me
im going to have to kill you youre my friend
then call it off
i cant
you did all this with one phase pistol
youre good at building things im good at blowing them up
im thinking we should get to the outer hull
no we might be safer trying to find another area with lifesupport
the hulls covered with subspace transceivers if i can link one of them to our communicators we might be able to contact enterprise
admiral the drones restored contact the repair systems are starting to work
itll take days let me know when its restored its ability to selfdestruct
come in
updating your will
you expect me to lose
shran is a member of the imperial guard trained in combat from childhood he wont back down
he cant i understand
if you back down the imperial guard will withdraw their ships
if i kill shran or one of the tellarites does the andorians will pull out anyway the tellaritesll do the same thing if shran kills one of them so im the only one who can be killed because starfleet wont withdraw this operation is important considering that it might lead to an alliance of planets
vulcans have a saying one man can summon the future what happens if that man throws away his life before his time
if ive learned anything these past few years on enterprise its that the future isnt fixed
if anything happens to you
then id better make sure that nothing does
didnt expect to find you up this late
what are you doing here
too wired to sleep hard to believe the captains going to be fighting a duel to the death in a few hours
barbaric if you ask me
what are you looking at
code of the ushann tpol wants me to go over it again see if i can find a way out of this mess
the last i heard the captain sounded determined to go through with it
she wants me to find a loophole some way to forfeit without offending the andorians
two of us could get through that a lot faster
look at this either combatant can postpone a duel indefinitely if there are no children to continue his clan
how does that help us
as far as i know captain archer doesnt have any kids if hes killed his clan would die with him
that rule only applies if hes married
dont suppose we can find him a wife in the next four hours
even if we could something tells me the andorians would cry foul there are twelve thousand amendments to this ridiculous honour code there has got to be one that can get him out of this
instead of looking for a loophole maybe we should be trying to find a way for the captain to win
if the captain wins shrans dead the alliance falls apart
have you ever been to nobelia prime
not recently
the tribal elders there they can challenge you to a duel if you look at them the wrong way happened to my father
how did he get out of it
which one of these has the combat rules
dont try and block with this when he swings intercept deflect and hook it away
better to insert between the eyes and twist
andorian metabolism is higher than humans keep moving youll exhaust him
how about i just win
take your places there is still time to end this
it can only end one way this is not what i wanted
things have a way of turning out differently than we expect
im glad we met in your honour ill continue to support cooperation between the imperial guard and your species
lets get this over with i got a ship to run
ill take your blood to andoria to the wall of heroes
not today
you have the first move
give up a single stroke and therell be no pain
you think im losing im just trying to make you look good in front of your soldiers
now do you give up
never
wrong choice
you shouldve cut off my head
i considered it but i still need your help
what good is a guardsman without two antennae
youll begin to compensate within a day or two
they take nine months to grow back
if left untreated with electrical stimulation and brisk cranial massage youll be back to normal in half that time
i was told that the loss of an antenna wasnt critical
you humiliated me
and that the ushann is settled when one fighter is rendered defenceless are we done
you respected andorian tradition its settled
bridge to captain archer
four ships have located the marauders power signature
can you pick up biosigns
not at this distance
travis plot an intercept course take us to maximum warp
intercept in forty seven minutes
alert the fleet
the drones sensors have detected enterprise its closing
activate the holographic skin
somethings starting to draw a lot of power its all those systems that went down in the explosion theyre coming back online
what about the warp matrix
not yet but if you want to contact enterprise wed better hurry
approaching visual range
on screen magnify
vulcan
check their power signature
it doesnt match
tactical alert charge weapons
enterprise will reach the drone before the matrix is restored
senator i was not told of your visit
you allowed our enemies to board and disable the drone i have my sources admiral
then you know we are about to engage the human ship
im here to witness its destruction
one minute
we have biosigns two humans
can you get a transporter lock
well need to be much closer
open a channel archer to tucker and reed respond
were both here captain
fire
target its weapons
i cant get a lock through the camouflage
take out the emitters but dont puncture the hull
they do know were on board
theyre probably trying to take out the weapons enterprise
any chance of using the transporter
you have to get closer to the hull
can you do that
were on our way
weve lost the emitters
warp status
two minutes more enemy ships are closing if enterprise stops the selfrepair sequence
the drone will escape
enterprise were at the hull
the ships movement is too erratic i cant get a lock
theyre targeting our warp core hull platings at forty three percent  thirty six percent
shut down weapons all power to hull plating travis bring us about trip malcolm we can make one more pass get the hell out of there
their weapons are offline theyre vulnerable
i cant imagine how things could get much worse
i can
theyre clear  sensors are down ive lost them
six more enemy ships within range
twenty seconds to warp
weve got company alliance ships
tell them not to fire our people are out there
the matrix is restored
withdraw
they left us you were right this is worse
anyone out there need a lift
if i had to wear this helmet for one more minute i swear it wouldve fused to my skull i tell you id like to find the designer of this suit and make him wear it for three days
yeah thanks for what you did back there
yeah you wouldve done the same for me
no you took a big chance which makes what i have to do all the more difficult im putting you on report
youre what
you disobeyed a direct order
i saved your life if you put a reprimand in my file it could be years before im even eligible for
are you pulling my leg
malcolm youre just such an easy target
the marauder got away one of the tellarite ships was hit an andorian warship rescued the crew
so its still out there as you said a common threat
i believe we have more to discuss than trade disputes
why wait until we get to babel
the drone has reentered romulan space
disconnect the pilot
this mission was supposed to cause dissension in the region its had the opposite effect
senator you have a right
the andorians and tellarites have formed an alliance theyre working together for the first time in history
it wont last
the group of senators doesnt share your optimism theyre presenting a motion to cancel this mission
that would be a mistake
the mistake was mine when i supported this endeavour do you realise how youve weakened my position
when this is over youll be first consul
after a failure of this magnitude i could be dead
this isnt a failure its a setback we have to deal with the humans they are the ones that brought the andorians and tellarites together the second drone ship is armed and ready for battle with two ships i can deliver a devastating blow we will hunt down enterprise and destroy it
the drone is being operated by telepresence its a process which allows a vessel to be controlled from a remote location
we experimented with that years ago nothing came of it
a pilot can operate the drone from a great distance over many light years
so there really was no one on that ship
and the people running it are back on their homeworld safe and sound
essentially
doesnt seem fair
is there any way to interrupt this telepresence
im still reviewing the data commander tucker brought back but i believe we can construct our own telepresence unit
and use it to hijack their ship
doubtful the most we can hope for is to interfere with their navigation
get started
there is one problem the data from the marauder also contained a brain wave pattern i believe it belongs to the pilot
ive analyzed it the individual is highly telepathic
apparently telepathy is necessary to operate the device
vulcans have telepathic powers
not to this extent
can you identify the species
theres no exact match in my database however the nearest genome is andorian
the humans did considerable damage to the bridge well have to replace the entire receiver array
assign every spare man to the repair crew
the ship isnt what concerns me its the pilot
what about him
operating the vessel is extremely taxing
hell have at least three days to rest
that wont be enough hes suffering from severe mental fatigue piloting one ship would be difficult enough but two
then youll have to increase the stimulants
the dosage is already at a dangerous level he could be permanently damaged he could die
if i didnt know you better i would say youre more concerned with this creatures wellbeing than you are with this mission
without the pilot there would be no mission
just keep him alive long enough to destroy the earth ship after that his health is of little consequence
come in
i just received a transmission our scientists identified the brain wave pattern
and
its from my world but its not from any andorian youd know its aenar theyre a kind of subspecies blind icedwellers for most of our history they were considered a myth stories we told our children but fifty years ago they were discovered living in the northern wastes theyre extremely secretive i can count on one hand the number of andorians whove seen one facetoface
could they have built a ship like the marauder
i seriously doubt they have the capacity there are only a few thousand of them left and even if they could theyre pacifists they dont believe in violence
one of them does
it seems that way
we need to find out whos controlling that ship
agreed
travis
yes sir
set a course for andoria maximum warp
you should rest
i just need a second
phlox thinks its too soon for you to return to duty
phlox you were talking to him about me
it came up in conversation
right well i dont have the option of taking a break the captain needs this done fast
i can manage
you might be the best there is at crunching numbers but when it comes to actually sticking things together youre a little out of your league these work better when you strip off the duranite caps dont ask me why they just do
ill make a note of that
you know when i was on that ship with malcolm i was convinced i was going to die you ever been there
since enterprise was launched weve all been near death on more than one occasion
im not talking close scrapes i mean when youre in a bad situation and you know this is it theres no way out and you have time to think about it
in the expanse when we were attempting to destroy sphere forty one i didnt believe wed survive
what went through your mind
whether or not to transfer auxiliary power to the deflector array why do you ask
just curious
the aenar compound is surrounded by a dampening field once youre inside you wont be able to contact the ship id feel much better about this if youd take a couple of macos with you
we go in there with a show of force we wont get a thing out of them
were going alone
captain we dont know anything about these people
thats why were here energise
taste that air really gets the blood running
twenty eight below
lucky for you its the middle of summer
yeah
the entrance is twenty metres ahead the vulcans say the desert teaches men the meaning of endurance but its the ice that forges real strength
its hard to believe anything can survive here
it isnt easy andorian cities are built underground to take advantage of geothermal energy i didnt see the sun till i was fifteen
careful shran you dont have your balance back yet
hands off pinkskin these tunnels branch out for thousands of kilometres not a good place to get lost
well be ready to launch in twelve hours
and the pilot
hes resting
will he be ready
ill make sure that he is
spoken like a soldier
im a scientist
were all soldiers nijil from the moment were born when we forget that we invite disaster you know i was once a senator
no
many years ago vrax and i were colleagues i even considered him a friend
what happened
i made the mistake of challenging the precept of unlimited expansion i asked the question is conquest truly the best course for our people and i was expelled
im sorry
im not trying to evoke your pity i want you to learn from my experience when i was led away from the senate chamber i vowed never to repeat my error and never to forget my purpose
i understand
continue with your preparations
icebores worms they live in the ice generate heat through a chemical reaction big swarm came through here a day or two ago
im sure phlox would love to get his hands on one
best to avoid them when i was a boy i stumbled into a large den wound up with thirddegree burns over half my body
shran listen to me we should find another way
afraid of heights captain
shran
the ice gave out beneath me
youre losing a lot of blood hold still
hold still bleedings stopped but if you move it could start again
we cant stay here well freeze to death
archer to enterprise archer to enterprise
were well inside the dampening field
it doesnt hurt to try how far are we from the aenar
i think we just got a lot closer
hello we need your help my friends been hurt
well assist you
theres not as much data on the neural interface as id like
its all we have
i can connect someone to the unit but itll be dangerous
how dangerous
if the interface malfunctions there could be severe neurolytic shock possibly resulting in brain damage
theres got to be some way we can make it safer
diagnostics will only tell us so much im afraid
when can we test it
a day
i want to be the first one to try it out
youre not telepathic it wouldnt be a true measure of the units effectiveness
well at least well find out if it causes brain damage
ill test the unit
youre the ranking officer too risky
considering whats at stake the risk is acceptable
we could at least wait until the captain gets back
our goal should be to have the unit ready by the time he returns that means conducting a full series of tests the discussions closed we have a lot of work to do
your wound is healing well youll be able to walk on your own in a few hours
my thanks
youre captain archer
you can read minds
we have a strict law here captain no one may enter anothers thoughts without permission i know your name because the andorian chancellor contacted us
i need to speak with someone in authority
we assign our leaders as the need arises for this occasion i have been chosen as speaker
i take it you know why were here
i know what the andorians have told us someones been attacking your ships and you believe were involved
its a bit more complicated than that
it will save time and foster our trust if i can have your thoughts
go ahead
you have an interesting mind captain many facets
thank you
some of those facets are in conflict
that explains a lot
shran
the evidence youve gathered appears irrefutable it seems there was an aenar controlling that ship
but youre sceptical
were a nonviolent people that a member of our race could cause so much death its extremely disturbing
do you have any idea who it could be
theres one possibility
who
a year ago one of our citizens disappeared while collecting icebores we assumed hed been killed in an accident but we never found his body
now you know why
gareb would not be doing this voluntarily
you think he was abducted
its the best explanation
it doesnt matter why hes doing it he has to be stopped
this device that youre building aboard your ship
were hoping it will disrupt the signal thats controlling the marauder
you will need one of us to operate it
you owe us that much at least
ill consult with the others
coffee strong
commander
hey
trip i appreciate your concern for my safety
i just dont want enterprise to lose a good officer
i think youre letting your feelings impact your work
my works as good as its ever been as far as my feelings go theyre purely professional
ive never been able to sleep with someone standing at the foot of my bed
i didnt mean to disturb you
actually i was awake what is it
ive never met a blueskin
youre blind how can you tell my skin is blue
dont ask me to explain i was never very good at science
is it true that where you come from the temperature rises above freezing for weeks at a time
every few years theres a heat wave ive been on worlds where the temperature is only slightly below the boiling point of water
i cant imagine such a place
im trying to forget it i lost ten percent of my body weight in two days
i came here to apologise
for what
when i saw you for the first time i sensed some of your thoughts i didnt intend to
its never been all that hard to figure out what im thinking
i know what its like to lose someone gareb the one whos missing hes my brother
im sorry
he would never hurt anyone not intentionally
so weve been told
do you think hes in pain
theres no way of knowing
i have nightmares garebs bound locked in a strange cage hes calling for me he wants me to rescue him
forgive me
how do you feel
i just need a moment
whenever youre ready indicators moving doc
so far so good
ill be damned its working
she okay
her synaptic response is erratic
ill be fine
its getting worse commander
thats enough shut it down
youre all right
it worked
ill rest for a few minutes and then well try again
you said gareb was abducted if thats true dont you want to help him
not with violence
were trying to stop violence
i wont deny that your intentions are honourable but our decision stands
forget it captain theyve never even helped defend their own world were wasting our time
systems ready
launch the drones
you need to rest
ive had enough rest
we should clear the dampening field soon
wait
what is it
a swarm
i dont see anything
itll take a few minutes for them to pass gareb and i loved chasing icebores once we followed a swarm for two hours caught hundreds of them we were almost at the surface my family was very worried theyre going to be worried about me now
are you sure you want to do this
i wont abandon my brother whats it like your ship
warm
she wants to try again you think its smart
you know the risks so does commander tpol commander shes doing her job
shes going to hurt herself
take my advice dont interfere
i cant believe im getting this from you now has everyone on this ship gone crazy
not everyone
oh im crazy
its not your fault as far as i know there are no species in the galaxy that have mastered the art of mixing romance and vocation
youre the last one that should be giving me a lecture vulcan neuropressure was your idea
you were having trouble sleeping
what the hell am i going to do
this is the one ailment that is universally untreatable youll have to suffer through it
weve been here before
hes right were going in circles theyre trying to stop us
how
theyre not letting us see the path to the surface
its time to come back
i cant
i dont want to fight anyone i want to help my brother
shes doing what she thinks is right
shes betraying her people
thats not true shouldnt she be allowed to follow her own conscience
how do you know have you read her mind i thought that was against your custom
jhamel
take my thoughts
yes
very well
anything on long range sensors
not yet
whats our eta
well be at their last known coordinates in six hours
tell malcolm to finish his upgrades to the targeting scanners if we run into that marauder again i want to make sure every shot counts
understood
report
shes good to go
whenever youre ready
im ready captain
a lot of movement fifty percent spike
we can stop anytime you like
its strangely enjoyable
shes maxed it out
is that good
very good
is there another test we can try
we could simulate a course correction
synaptic trouble
shut it down
im picking up debris hull fragments nacelle casings several bodies human
keep scanning try to find the marauders warp signature
is there any word from sickbay
shes going to be okay but phlox says its too dangerous to try again looks like we went all the way to andoria for nothing
what happened
you had a convulsion youre all right now
i was dreaming about gareb i failed didnt i
ridiculous that kind of bravery is never a failure im a commander in the imperial guard id be afraid to go anywhere near that thing
talas was a fortunate woman
i was the fortunate one
my brother is going to die isnt he
i wont hear that from you
its hard to be strong
you make it look easy keep being strong for me
a ships dropping out of warp it appears to be a tellarite freighter
tactical alert hail them target their engines
if it is a freighter
anything
one hundred kilometres
fire
whats happening
were under attack im going to the bridge
wait i can feel him
connect me to the device i need to try again
i can reach him i can make him stop
let her try
enterprise is taking heavy damage
target with the second drone attack vector one seven seven
it may not be necessary
follow my orders
yes admiral
another ships approaching bearing oh one six mark twelve an andorian battle cruiser
tpol
its power signature is not andorian
target them
captain im picking up an energy reading from sickbay its the telepresence unit
archer to sickbay whats going on
is she up to it
shes quite insistent
cortical fluctuation it could trigger a seizure
jhamel
i can do it
disconnect her now
no
she can do this
theyve lost warp power
continue targeting their engines
someones tapping into the telemetric array
jhamel
its me
its not possible how
you have to stop what youre doing
where are you
im on the ship youre attacking
both drones are coming to a stop were defenceless
theyve stopped firing
i thought you were dead they said i was the last surviving aenar
they lied to you
ive killed so many people
it wasnt you it was them they forced you you can stop it you know what you have to do
the first drone is targeting the second
take all weapons offline
ive lost access
theyre attacking each other
lets give them a hand photonic torpedoes full spread
aye sir
stop this now
no
resume your attack on the earth ship
remember me jhamel
gareb
i want to thank you again
i owe you a thanks if i hadnt come with you my brother would have died alone goodbye captain
goodbye
i regret much of what happened between us recently
same here
when you lose your ship you arent usually rewarded with another one i may not see you for a while
if theres anything we can do or say on your behalf
i appreciate the offer lets just see what the future brings try to stay out of trouble pinkskin
senator i assume im under arrest
were both under arrest
so it seems ill be serving with you again nijil goodbye
the failure is mine not yours
spoken like a soldier
come in
ive been looking over your report i think youre being a little hard on yourself
theres no getting around it i missed a ten degree variance in the telepresence emitter
i spoke with phlox he doesnt think it had anything to do with jhamels seizure
but he cant be sure either way i should have caught it
we were all under a lot of pressure
my mind wasnt on the job
if that were true we probably wouldnt be standing here now
captain i want a transfer
where
columbia they need experienced people
you turned them down twice before why now
i think i can do some good over there
i need you here trip
they need me more
whats this really about
i told you
i havent heard one thing that explains this
ive said everything i want to
thats it im supposed to accept that and if i refuse your transfer
captain as a friend im asking you let me do this
its your career trip but as a friend im asking you to stay
i cant
all right
thank you
dismissed
what do you want with me
secure him
i demand to see the magistrate
my death sentence was commuted
yeah
shes a thing of beauty
columbias virtually identical to enterprise
a good engineer can see the differences you coming to the mess hall later my going away party
i dont understand the logic behind this transfer youre not being promoted
you think im doing this to advance my career
you wouldnt leave captain archer without sufficient reason
well for one thing this is a new challenge it took me a year to finetune enterprise i figure i can do the same for captain hernandez in half the time she needs a chief engineer whos been out there has the experience
are you leaving because of me
look starfleets approved the transfer
you didnt answer my question
this may come as a shock but not everything in my life revolves around you
im glad we got here early
there never used to be a wait to get in
you didnt think madame changs was going to be your little secret forever did you
there are a lot of starfleet people here
thats probably my fault i told a few friends about the place
a few
im a comm officer if theres one thing that i know how to do its disseminate information you didnt tell me how your meeting went today at the ime
they asked if i was interested in becoming director of xenobiology
thats great are you going to accept
im considering it the truth is ive grown rather fond of my shipmates im not certain im ready to leave them just yet what would you suggest
im the wrong person to ask ive got a vested interest in keeping you around
you denobulan come with us
what do you want
maybe you didnt hear me
dolsha tung nevrleel
hoshi
im all right sir
who did this
thats what im trying to determine commander collins starfleet security
jonathan archer this is lieutenant reed
there were three men they were in the shadows i didnt get a good look at them
you told me before that one of them said something to the others
right before i passed out im pretty sure it wasnt english
do you remember what he said
im sorry sir
the only dna weve recovered belongs to ensign sato and to your doctor we did find some residual ionisation traces here
a transporter signature
very few people have access to that kind of technology
still its a likely explanation
doctor phlox was involved in an altercation the last time he was in san francisco
you think this is related
assaults against aliens are still pretty rare if the man who attacked him was holding a grudge
he was a loudmouth in a bar i doubt he could find his head with both hands never mind organise a kidnapping
were pursuing all avenues excuse me captain lieutenant
check with starfleet operations see if their satellites picked up any transporter activity this evening
the dilithium matrix has got to be aligned within point three microns
the specs say point five
who do you think wrote those specs
a warp field specialist
exactly some guy whos probably never been outside the solar system ive spent the last three and a half years crawling inside one of these engines i know what im talking about
aye sir
biggs pierce  i want you to recalibrate the field stabilisers rivers and strong start with the injector assembly this bucket of bolts was supposed to leave dry dock six months ago i guarantee you columbias going to warp out of orbit before the end of the week lets get to work
its customary to report to the captain after a transfer
im sorry maam i wanted to see what the situation was like before we spoke commander charles tucker reporting for duty
welcome aboard
trip is it
thats right
so what do you think can she be salvaged
i think theres a good chance any news on doctor phlox
not so far if i hear anything ill let you know you certainly know how to motivate the troops
well be pulling triple shifts if we want to meet this new launch date
you still need to eat captains mess tomorrow eighteen hundred hours we can trade stories about your former co
ill be there
commander drop by the quartermasters at the end of your shift
maam
might want to update your uniform
aye captain
come in
weve heard nothing from the kidnappers not even a ransom demand
ive spoken with the denobulan ambassador hes notified the doctors wives
hoshi thought she overheard one of the kidnappers say something in another language but she was semiconscious at the time maybe you could help her remember
a mindmeld ive never initiated a meld before i dont have the proper training
i know its dangerous but i can walk you through it
you
i had suraks katra in my head for four days i picked up a few tricks
computer access satellite logs one three seven time parameters nineteen hundred and nineteen forty five today
what starfleet operations this is lieutenant malcolm reed aboard enterprise please acknowledge
burning the midnight oil lieutenant
sir i thought i was calling starfleet ops
let me guess you want to know why the grid covering san francisco was down for maintenance tonight
something like that
meet me at this address in one hour
my mind to your mind our minds are merging our minds are one
nothings happening
tpol try to relax your emotional suppression just a little
i feel what you feel i know what you know  can you hear me
yes perfectly
you and the doctor have just left the restaurant
im glad we got here early
there never used to be a wait to get in
good
they asked if i was interested in becoming director of xenobiology
where were you attacked
there
truth is ive grown rather fond of my shipmates
do you see them
just yet what would you suggest
yes
you denobulan come with us
what do you want
maybe you didnt hear me
focus on the moment put aside any pain
dolsha tung nevrleel
dolsha tung nevrleel
dolsha tung nevrleel
bring him with us its rigelian
a rigelian freighter left orbit two hours after phloxs abduction according to their flight plan they were headed for proxima colony
this trajectory wont take them anywhere near proxima colony ensign
sir
put admiral gardner through to my ready room shore leaves are cancelled get everyone back on board
am i to understand you are responsible for taking that satellite grid offline
not me personally
but youre involved phlox is my friend do you know where he is
we have an assignment for you
i wasnt aware that i was still a part of your section
theres a job that needs doing lieutenant and it may be the only way to save your friends life
welcome to quvat colony doctor you will work with doctor antaak
i will do nothing of the kind
then you will die
im certain there are easier ways for you to recruit a new lab assistant
you misunderstand me doctor antaak will be assisting you
its good to see you again doctor
i beg your pardon
i wouldnt expect you to remember but we met briefly five years ago at the ime conference on tiburon
i dont recall meeting a klingon at that conference
i was disguised as a member of the mazarite delegation my people werent invited
i will let you two get reacquainted i suggest you work quickly doctor i expect a progress report by sunrise
you must forgive the generals conduct the warrior caste has little use for social protocols
what do you want with me
the empire is facing its gravest threat since the hurq invasion a virus is spreading from planet to planet millions are already infected if this continues the klingon species will cease to exist
why didnt you simply ask for our help starfleet and denobula wouldve provided you with all of the specialists youd need
you dont understand the klingon way doctor to ask for assistance would make us look weak in the eyes of our enemies it could even incite rebellion
why me
i was impressed by your lecture at the conference your paper on viral propagation was very insightful
what field of study are you in precisely
metagenic research ive already isolated the virus i assume youll want to start by mapping the nucleotides it wasnt my idea to abduct you nevertheless you are here millions of lives are at risk
the freighters warp trail has terminated
they may have dropped to impulse
how long to intercept
at our current speed eight point two hours
archer to engineering commander kelby respond
kelby here sir
we could use a little more speed
the injectors are running at a hundred and five percent
commander tuckers pushed them higher than that before
ill see what i can do captain
i dont know whos in charge of your mess hall but he could give the chef on enterprise a run for his money
i stole him from the republic captain jennings said i could have anything i wanted when i left so i took his cook ive gotten two transfer requests from crewmen in your department
who
its probably better if i didnt mention names i denied them youre already shorthanded quite an impression youve made commander youve been aboard less than two days and already some of your team want to jump ship
ive knocked a few heads together but were getting the job done well be ready for warp trials by thursday
i was surprised you accepted this transfer i saw an interview with you after the xindi mission you said you couldnt see yourself serving on any other starship
well youve got a good memory captain
it comes in handy
i was getting a little too comfortable on enterprise got a lot of friends over there but sometimes its easier to work with people who are just colleagues
why are you here
i was about to ask you the same thing is this a daydream
im meditating this is where i go in my mind
well i wouldve thought youd pick a more interesting place like the beach or one of those fire plains you showed me
please leave
exactly where am i supposed to go
away
this is my daydream you go away
excuse me commander is everything all right
yeah im fine
the diagnostic you asked for
thanks
bridge to tpol were approaching the coordinates
on my way
no biosigns im reading several bodies aboard
is one of them denobulan
theyre all rigelian
can you tell who did this
no sir ill have to bring aboard some of the debris and analyse it
scan for their data recorder it might tell us something
unless im mistaken this virus is a mutated form of the levodian flu
its immune to whatever antiviral weve tried
we should contact the ime they may have seen this mutation before im certain theyll be willing to share their database with us i know of a few indirect channels no one would have to know
theres no reason to contact them weve acquired their entire database
you stole it
medical research isnt a priority for the high council im forced to obtain information however i can
that doesnt sound very honourable
given the choice between honour and saving lives i choose the latter
perhaps you should ask your superiors to steal a genome sequencer were not going to be able to map the virus without the proper technology
this mans been infected
very observant
were being exposed
this patient is at stage one the virus doesnt become contagious until stage three
when i asked you to bring me a subject for dissection i assumed hed already be dead
he wont be alive much longer
what do you think youre doing
euthanising him
out of the question i thought you were committed to saving lives
it is more honourable to give ones life to medical research than to die for no purpose
that choice is not ours to make
proceed
computer establish an encrypted commlink starfleet frequency seven nine baker
lieutenant
you told me the klingons were going to rendezvous with that freighter not destroy it
i regret what happened but they had to cover their tracks
how many were on board that ship
thats not your concern have you analysed the weapon signatures yet
yes
you havent told archer
im not certain how much longer i can keep this from him
orion raiders have been known to operate in this area
you want me to lie again i could explain the situation to the captain
you have a peculiar sense of humour lieutenant
ive worked closely with the man you can trust him
archer is a starfleet captain his duty would be to report everything you tell him to admiral gardner they would launch an investigation
im being compromised sir and i dont like it
then i suggest you adjust your comfort level lieutenant you made a commitment to us long before you joined the enterprise
tactical alert all hands to battle stations
what was that
i believe were under attack
hull platings holding
still no response
target their weapons
weve been boarded d deck starboard side access tube seven
seal it off get the macos down there
target weapons on this location
disable that ship i dont want them getting away
return to the transport site
theyve activated their transporter
theyre going to warp
pursuit course
the helms not responding
wake him up
why did you attack us
sohvad pagh vijatlh human
i have nothing to say to you human
that sounds like
klingon
there must be some kind of mistake
what is it
according to his biosignature he is klingon
he must have been surgically altered to look human
any theories
i need to run further tests their boarding party disabled our antimatter flow regulators warp drive should be repaired in six hours
give our new chief engineer a hand tell him to dig a little deeper see if these klingons damaged any other systems
the rigelian freighter did you get anything out of the black box
its been erased
it mightve been a safeguard in case it fell into the wrong hands
work with hoshi see if you can reconstruct any data
there is something familiar about these basepair sequences
familiar
boshar feeding time is over go back
do you think its wise to keep wild animals in here
there are dozens of creatures in your sickbay
i dont let them roam free
i could never keep boshar locked up he was my first patient he tore his side open when i was a child i stitched the wound myself
i have seen these sequences before six months ago to be precise this is augment dna how did modified human genes find their way into this virus
is that really such a surprise doctor it took only two human augments to commandeer a bird of prey and murder its entire crew the empire could not allow an inferior species to gain an advantage on us imagine every starfleet vessel manned with genetically engineered humans
earth banned genetic engineering decades ago the augments who attacked you were relics of another era
the vulcans told that to the high council they werent very persuasive we were simply responding to a threat
you were trying to create klingon augments but soongs experiments were all killed where did you get the genetic material
several embryos were found in the wreckage of the bird of prey we used them to resequence a number of test subjects there were some unanticipated side effects
their cranial ridges started to dissolve augment dna was more aggressive than you realised
for a time it appeared we were quite successful our augments might have looked human but they were klingon stronger more intelligent then their neural pathways started to degrade they died in agony one of the test subjects was suffering from the levodian flu the augment genes modified the virus
it became airborne you should have told me this earlier
if you hope to ever leave this place i suggest you stop asking questions and resume work
what do you think
we may be able to reconstruct the directory with a recursive algorithm
is it unusual to have weird dreams after a mind meld
subconscious thoughts are often exchanged they sometimes surface during sleep
i had a bizarre dream last night commander tucker was in it we were in a strange place it was all white there was almost a romantic quality to it i dont ever remember dreaming about commander tucker before
most unusual
the recorder was erased deliberately
malcolm said there mightve been a safeguard
the memory core was wiped by that microdyne coupler
youre sure
it left a unique magnetic signature
we found it in storage locker c fourteen the last person to access that locker was lieutenant reed
im not quite sure what youre getting at sir
only someone with security clearance of alphafour or higher had access to the black box thats just tpol you and me
i agree it is a bit of a mystery
youre sure that freighter was destroyed by orion weapons
theres no doubt
i asked tpol to doublecheck your analysis the freighter was fired on by klingon disruptors
with all due respect sir it must have been a mistake
ive seen the sensor logs
someone could have tampered with them
i want to know what the hell is going on  answer me lieutenant
respectfully sir i refuse to answer any more questions
malcolm i never wouldve believed that you of all people
corporal lieutenant reeds been relieved of duty escort him to the brig and confine him
weve set course for klingon territory we havent picked up any warp signatures yet i may have to take this ship into their space i dont have to tell you how dangerous that is if you know where theyve taken phlox
i have no idea where the doctor is captain on that you have my word
your word isnt worth a lot at the moment
the malcolm reed i know would give his life before committing treason
im not working for the klingons
who then youve betrayed everything that uniform stands for
captain there are some obligations that go beyond my loyalty to you and this crew
what the hell does that mean
i cant say any more
you havent said much of anything youve told me a lot about your father his years in the royal navy their tradition of honour and service how do you think hell react when he learns youre facing courtmartial
i wouldnt know sir
were running out of time
i cant sequence these nucleotides any faster perhaps you shouldve abducted doctor soong he couldve mapped this genome more efficiently than i can
we tried soong was under heavy guard
if you dont accelerate your efforts there will be no one left to cure the high council has dispatched the fleet they have annihilated nvak colony
nvak was one of the first planets affected by the plague
theyre massacring the victims
the council will do whatevers required to contain this outbreak
general were making progress but ill need a few weeks to develop an antiviral agent it will have to be tested
millions will be infected by then the council will not wait
how long until the fleet reaches us
five days
i cant cure this in five days
they wouldnt destroy us if they knew we had created klingon augments
the experiment failed
it succeeded for a brief period if phlox and i can find a way to stabilise the human dna prior to the onset of stage three our augments would survive if were successful you could use them as leverage force the high council to give us more time to find a cure
you dont seriously expect me to help you create klingon augments
you could save the inhabitants of this planet
i wont assist you
kill me if you must i refuse to cooperate
take him
hail the dock master this is captain hernandez request permission to depart
youre cleared for departure smooth sailing columbia
thank you
bridge to engineering are we ready mister tucker
just a few more seconds  i hope ensign
dilithium matrix is stable driver coils are configured for warp speed
nice work engineering to bridge were ready whenever you are captain
time to weigh anchor  lieutenant aft thrusters at one half until we clear spacedock then take us to warp
so what are you in for
is your captain hoping youll obtain information from me
i shouldnt think so
why are you here
thats a long story
entertain me
i lied to him
youre fortunate to be alive a klingon who betrays his captain would be immediately executed
why did you and your men board enterprise you know you may find this hard to believe but you and i actually want the same thing
and what is that
a cure theres no reason for you or any more of your people to die
theres a malfunction in the intermix chamber plasma pressures rising
the antimatter flow regulators are locked open
did the klingons damage them
uncertain
pressures approaching critical
can we drop to impulse
the reactor would breach but we can reduce pressure by increasing speed
go to maximum warp  get down to engineering see what you can do
you sabotaged us how do we repair the damage if our reactor breaches youre going to die with us
im a soldier of the empire im prepared to die
captain you need your tactical officer please sir i can be useful
commander did you see that
please be more specific
on the monitor
tpol to captain archer
go ahead
the warp matrix has been compromised
by a klingon subroutine
can you remove it
im not certain its infiltrated our command protocols
do what you can
bridge to captain archer pressures increasing again
take us to warp five point two
sir we cant hold that speed for long
were out of options travis five point two
acknowledged
we have forty seven minutes until our reactor breaches
what did the klingons do to it
they altered our engineering subroutines if we go below warp five the reactors going to explode
how can i help
ive just been talking with trip columbia can rendezvous with us in thirty minutes he says he can restore the subroutines
he cant do that from columbia
were going to bring him onboard
the transporter wont operate at warp and dockings out of the question
trip told me you have experience transferring personnel at warp speed
in training exercises yes and at warp speed one every move was rehearsed in simulators for weeks
we dont have weeks
well have to merge our warp field with columbias
tpols doing the calculations now at warp five well have to move within fifty metres of each other
has anyone ever done this before
travis can handle the flying can you get trip over here
youll have to let me out of this brig
commander tucker
are you ready for this
as ready as ill ever be
open a channel
columbia to enterprise
this is archer
were matching speed and trajectory as requested
stand by columbia archer to reed
go ahead
were in position
have them start their rotation
coming up on one hundred metres ninety eighty metres
this is the bridge all hands brace for warp field contact
hold her steady travis
or chefll know who to blame for the mess in the galley
were at fifty metres and holding
make sure everythings ready for trip in engineering
archer to reed youre all clear
understood
columbia im deploying the tether
nice shooting malcolm
tucker to captain hernandez
go ahead
im heading out
quick as you can commander
never thought id see the stars like this
eyes on the cable commander i need you back here in one piece
youre doing fine trip
tpol whats happening
im reading a fluctuation in the warp field
take power from life support if you have to
but keep the field constant
sir im having trouble holding position fifty two metres fifty five
dont mean to be a pest but could someone tell me whats going on
youre almost here trip keep going
engineering report
im rerouting power now captain stand by
fifty nine metres
the tethers at its limit hurry up
tpol to the bridge its not working the field is still fluctuating
almost there
trip
permission to come aboard
bridge i have him
you all right trip
ill feel a lot better when this is over theres only one way to do this captain a cold start i have to shut down the reactor and reset the algorithms once we bring the warp engine back online the subroutines should be back to normal
but if we shut down the reactor
thats why we need to move inside columbias warp field
they can sustain our speed while i reinitialize the engines
they wont be able to hold us for more than a minute or two they dont have enough power
ive got a shortcut in mind
shortcut
those subroutines
would take hours to decrypt better just to purge them wipe them clean
ill contact columbia
whatre they here for
the captain and i have had a slight misunderstanding
how slight
these gentlemen are here to escort me back to the brig dont worry ill tell you all about it when were not quite so busy
fancy meeting you here intermix pressure
fifteen twenty seven
field variance
eighty seven millicochranes
somebody hasnt been taking very good care of my engine
speak with the klingons what are you doing
you might want to take notes im about to perform a manual shutdown and restart in less than two minutes
thats not possible
watch me
columbia to enterprise
go ahead
ive routed everything ive got to my warp field
do me a favour jonathan make this quick
archer to trip ready when you are
stand by everyone get away from the bulkheads its going to get a little hot in here
reactor shut down in five four three two one
tpol prime the injectors jenkins man the relays
yes sir
colombia to enterprise youve got about forty seconds
understood
trip hows it going
just another minute captain
you dont have a minute
get ready to initialise the matrix
enterprise were losing the field
fifteen seconds trip
almost there full power to containment fire up the antimatter stream
ten seconds nine eight seven six
commander
here we go
four three two
weve got warp power
engineering to the bridge the subroutines have been purged
appreciate the house call mister tucker
any time id like to drop to impulse for a while
captain just to check things over
stand by enterprise to columbia thanks for the lift
youre not getting away with my chief engineer that easily
any plans for the next few days
whatve you got in mind
phlox phlox this will help  my apologies for the generals conduct so cruel this is no way to treat a man of science
then end it contact starfleet
my people need you phlox we have no healers with your abilities
you want me to create klingon augments living weapons i wont do it
no no ive been reviewing your work its brilliant you have discovered a weakness in the virus causing the plague if we interrupt the transcription sequence here
yes yes that would stop the genetic effects of the virus in stage one thered be changes of appearance some minor neural reordering but no development of stage two characteristics no enhanced strength or speed or endurance but then general kvagh would not get his augments he would never allow it
what if we dont tell him
do you understand what will happen if the general learns that weve deceived him
a cure would save millions of innocent lives what more honourable death could there be for a healer klingon or denobulan
i dont suppose you can tell me where im going this time no i didnt think so
those are my personal files
not when they affect my ship tpol restored everything you tried to erase we ran his face and voiceprint through our database his name is harris he worked in starfleet security up till five years ago after that his file ends
captain theres nothing more i can add
i wont accept that you endangered every member of this crew you answer to me i thought i knew you malcolm whatever hold this harris has on you you could have come to me
im under orders
im your commanding officer if you dont tell me whats going on ill go to starfleet whatever you think youve been trying to keep hidden is going to come out is that what you want is that what you want
i cant tell you what i dont know
then let me talk to someone who can send a message to harris
has the house of phlox always been one of healers
there is no uh house of phlox denobulan family units are different from klingons
ah yes ive heard three wives for each husband three husbands for each wife your mating practices must be very complex
wondrously so what about the house of antaak
we are a warrior caste when i became a healer my father disowned me
as a physician in the imperial fleet youve served in the military
not as well as i should have i did not screen my subjects properly this plague all its victims its my fault my failure is the reason youre here
the humans could not stop us
i am your superior you will salute
enterprise was destroyed starfleet will think it was her engines
one of you is missing
your son was slow the humans killed him
did he die with honour
he let humans kill him
report
doctor phlox has made excellent progress
details
ive identified the rna sequences that code
details i can pass on to my superiors
i know where to look for the switch that will turn off the virus
how long until you find it
an hour
one hour
what do you want
i have news for the high council
explain
the denobulan is close to perfecting the augments genome
the council has shut down your project
if you sterilise this colony then all our research will be lost
the fleet will reach you in three days if youre successful by the time we enter orbit quvat will be spared
captain its going to be a while before everythings back to normal in engineering
can kelby handle it
i could pull a little double duty to help him out i could check with captain hernandez
something else
what the hells going on with malcolm
nothing i can get into right now
fair enough guess id better get back to columbia
ill walk with you
are you enjoying your time aboard columbia
sure why wouldnt i
you havent been experiencing any problems
such as
adjusting to new food new routines trouble sleeping
i sleep just fine how about you
fine
you sure about that
quite
your hour is up
were getting the test results now
we are running out of time
general i know the klingon fleet is on its way and i understand what this project cost you personally antaak told me about your son
he died in combat for the empire
at least he was spared the final stage of this disease may i ask how he was infected
command chose his unit for the augment experiment when we had exhausted our supply of prisoners my son was a warrior he asked for no special treatment and i gave him none
whatd they give you
its dead i cant eat that no wonder youre all so weak
physical strength isnt everything
well you cant win wars without it
being smart is more important general sun tzu said that the greatest victories are those won without fighting
the great kahless said theres no victory without combat
do you ever question why you fight
soldiers dont question they obey
what if your superiors are wrong
theyre imprisoned or killed
thats not how we do things in starfleet
which is why the klingon empire will defeat you
then how come youre in the same brig that im in
you said wed become stronger this is what youve done to us
he will become infectious soon he should be quarantined
well remain here if were going to die well die together as comrades
be patient lieutenant the denobulan is working to stabilise the human dna you will all be healthy again and stronger than any klingon
will he restore our appearance
i dont know
how do you expect us to return home looking like this we will be outcasts there will be no place for us in the empire
your heart is still klingon
are you certain of that during the battle with the starfleet ship i felt fear for the first time since i was a child i wasnt alone i could see it in the eyes of the others weve become like them weak cowardly it would be better for us to die
as long as i draw breath the empire will not turn its back on you
i get the feeling you miss phlox too maybe its just the stash of cheese hes got in sickbay  hold that thought
captain archer im told you have some questions for me
wheres my doctor
hes safe on a mission of great importance to starfleet
phlox was kidnapped starfleet would never authorise that
reread the charter article 14 section 31 there are a few lines that make allowances for bending the rules during times of extraordinary threat
what threat
take your pick earths got a lot of enemies
klingons attacked my ship is that what were talking about
what i want to talk about is lieutenant reed hes done good work for us over the years dont be too hard on him he was just following my orders
you put him in an impossible position
i can understand why you would feel that way but this is bigger than one captain and one ship
youre going to have to do better than that
all i can tell you is that if you interfere before phlox completes his assignment the repercussions will affect entire worlds
one of these four strains has the genetic trigger that can neutralise the virus before it advances to its lethal stage
which one
i dont know yet thats why i have to check each of them
how long will it take
a week your fleet can quarantine this world while i complete my tests sterilisation is not necessary
fleet admiral krell will not extend his deadline
the only possible way to get results on krells schedule is to infect four healthy klingons
you have four right here
only one of these strains will work the other three will be lethal ethically its unthinkable
the ethics doctor are simple three lives to save millions
at first it didnt seem like lying
what else would you call it
covert operations i was a young ensign it was exciting
how do you feel about it now
i thought it was done this is the first time that harris has contacted me since ive served on enterprise he told me about the plague he said they needed phlox to help the klingons find a cure i was supposed to just slow us down
did harris tell you about this
i had tpol take a closer look at our prisoners medical scans
its human dna
im guessing the plague is a side effect of a military experiment that went wrong
i didnt know
harris claims hes doing this because starfleet needs a stable klingon empire
do you believe him
i dont trust him if the klingons needed our help there are easier ways to get it
i wanted to tell you everything captain
theres a way out of this i dont have to put you back in the brig but you have to choose where your loyalties lie
i wasnt told where phlox was taken but starfleet intelligence believe that klingons have a genetic research facility on quvat colony
as you were
how long until we reach quvat
six hours sir
captain we need to be ready for klingon patrols i suggest that columbia withdraws to a safer distance so that we dont make a single target
open a channel to captain hernandez
why did you think youd succeed in perfecting augments when doctor soong failed
soongs mistake was that he made too few of them
the earth once had thousands they became tyrannical and started a war
klingons have discipline
augments dont their increased aggression is matched by their decreased inhibitions youd lose control of them just as humans did
how long until we know which one of us survives
an hour at most
would bloodwine affect the results
i dont believe so
then we shall drink to the bravery of these warriors doctor
never on the job
we know phlox was taken to quvat colony to work on a cure were going to be there in less than an hour
krells patrols will crush you
theyve all been recalled to enforce quarantine zones
phlox will be in the medical facility we need the coordinates if you dont want to help us help your people
my brothers
theyre quite ill so are you try to rest
doctor the two guards are displaying the first symptoms
that accounts for two of the three lethal strains
so either general kvagh lives or i do  its the general isnt it his strain has the cure
if we work quickly theres a chance we can treat you in time
what now
theres been a complication
another one
this time your people failed to stop enterprise its on its way to quvat with columbia
order them to withdraw
you know i dont have that authority
then ill destroy them
we had an arrangement
you did what i wanted i dont need you anymore
you agreed that both our governments would benefit if the two of us worked together
and you believed me
load the amino acids ill extract the viral dna from his blood
captain
you all right
better now that you are here
father
i was told that you had been killed
the humans spared me
i came to get my doctor back
we need him here
i have two ships in orbit heavily armed
gentlemen please i think i can speak for myself captain i need a little more time to cure this plague
cure you were supposed to be perfect the augment genome
i lied your son may be alive but he will not survive much longer unless i dont complete my work a few hours captain thats all i ask several million patients are counting on it
commander three klingon battlecruisers have just dropped out of warp
open a channel to columbia
the klingons are jamming everything
what is it
krells ships are here
keep working archer to enterprise tell the klingons we have the cure enterprise respond
this is fleet admiral krell
im under orders to eradicate this colony
you dont have to do that my doctor can stop the plague
i have a more effective solution
hello admiral krell this is doctor phlox i am transmitting the details of an antivirus feel free to have your physicians confirm my findings and youre welcome to call with any questions
my orders are clear
captain archer your ships are now the property of the klingon empire stand down or be destroyed proceed as planned leave nothing standing
the lead ships moving into a lower orbit
theyre charging weapons
intercept course columbia
i cant get through
theyre firing on the colony
target their disruptors
how strong are the shields around this place
not strong enough you said you had two ships in orbit
im sure theyre doing everything they can archer to enterprise
theyre closing from astern  aft cannons are down
columbia to enterprise looked like you could use a hand lets keep those ships off their tail
your ships are taking damage
how much longer
as i said in another few hours
can you speed that up a little phlox ive got an idea if we want to get out of here in one piece weve got to get that cure and were got to get it fast
i could finish the antivirus in less time if i had a human host to replicate enough antibodies
i dont see any other humans around
captain i would have to expose you to the plague i cannot predict what it might do to you
will it give you the cure
unquestionably
lets get started
what do you intend to do
this virus may be our best weapon against krell ready when you are
one of the ships is losing power their port nacelle is vulnerable
then fire at will
in addition to the virus im injecting you with a metabolic catalyst to accelerate your immune response it wont be pleasant
its no use i cant penetrate their shields
commander ive broken through their jamming frequencies
tpol to captain archer
captain respond
doctor phlox here the captain is indisposed at the moment
i imagine you have your hands full up there
to say the least
we have a plan to defuse this situation but well need a few more minutes to carry it out id appreciate it if you could keep the ceiling from caving in on us until then
understood
how much hull plating do we have left
sixty two percent
mister mayweather put us directly between that cruiser and the colony you may want to divert all available power to our dorsal plating
aye aye
its working
theyre shifting their orbit
stay with them
hull platings down to forty percent
keep firing captain hernandez please direct your weapons at the battle cruiser
wish i could help we just lost our weapons
its done hold him
weve got it is the canister ready
its set to disperse five seconds after transport
send it open a channel to krell
hull platings nearly down we cant hold this position much longer
admiral krell doctor phlox again by now you may have noticed the
small package which we sent to your bridge what you may not know is that it contains a potent sample of the metagenic virus even as we speak it is dispersing throughout your ship infecting you and your crew
youre lying
check your internal sensors you will find
that the atmosphere contains approximately twenty parts per million of the viral strain or if you dont trust your sensors trust your senses you will feel the initial symptoms in about thirty minutes a tightness in the chest irregular heartbeat
tingling in your cranial ridges
this is a cowardly attack
maybe so but im prepared to give you the cure thanks to captain archer ive managed to complete the antivirus of course if you destroy this colony well treating you and your crew could prove difficult i suggest you power down your weapons admiral and let me cure your people
theres no trace of the virus in your bloodstream
my targ wont even recognise me
in the future it may be possible to reverse the cosmetic effects
i suppose this is what i deserve millions of my people will have to live with this disfigurement itll be passed on to our children life wont be easy for us
you did your best to correct your mistakes thats all we can ask of ourselves
i doubt my superiors will allow me to remain in my position ill need to find a new specialty perhaps cranial reconstruction
i have a feeling thats about to become very popular
im grateful for everything that youve done
how are you feeling
not too bad aside from some strange cravings a plate full of live gagh sounds pretty good right now
the cravings should disappear in a day or so along with your ridges
no id keep them if i were you captain it makes you look intimidating
i should be get back on the road
one of us needs to get some exploring done thanks for your help
i dont know how you survived all these years without me
shouldnt you be joining her
i asked trip to stick around for a little while to help us out with repairs
indeed our new chief engineer will no doubt be delighted for the help
no kelbys got nothing to worry about im only here temporarily
what do you want
i called to thank you everything went according to our projections the empires been stabilised i doubt very much theyll be experimenting with augments anytime soon
we couldve explained everything to captain archer
thats not how krell wanted things done
since when do we do things the way the klingons want
when its in our interest i had to keep certain details from you as well i hope there are no hard feelings this mission wouldnt have succeeded without you lieutenant
dont ever contact me again is that clear
maybe you didnt understand our recruitment policy you cant simply walk away
i answer to one commanding officer jonathan archer
lieutenant why dont we
a vulcan science vessel surveyed the seventh planet over fifty years ago the file states its an m class world with a flourishing ecosystem no intelligent life
sounds promising
they did report one distinctive feature which bears mentioning
and that is
a species of flying reptile some reportedly over two hundred metres long theyre also said to breathe fire theres been lingering questions over the accuracy of this report
cant wait to find out
theres a ship its on an intercept course
i dont recognise the configuration
lets see it
doesnt look very friendly
tactical alert lets see what they want hoshi
theyre responding
captain archer
and you are
harradsar deactivate your weapon systems immediately or ill be forced to open fire  youre still targeting my ship
and youre targeting mine it seems were at an impasse
not for long
instead of sitting here pointing guns at each other why dont we deactivate our weapons together
very well
now what can we do for you
i have a proposal to make
im listening
i prefer to discuss business in person youre invited aboard my ship
weve dealt with your people before the experience wasnt one i care to repeat if you can give me some idea what this is about
what i have to say could smooth relations between your starfleet and the orion syndicate my hospitality is renowned captain i dont offer it to everyone and once i have been refused i never offer it again
the last orions we ran into almost turned nine of our crewmembers into slaves lets at least ask him to come here
i have a feeling hed see it as an insult
i can live with that
any chance to improve relations with the syndicate im willing to take that risk anything to have one less hostile species out there
seven of the transfer conduits are back on line the eighth is still giving us some trouble
did you run a phase diagnostic
came back negative
better work up a bypass
already underway
kelby kelby
we have a problem
im not sure what you mean sir
look the captain asked me to stick around as soon as the repairs are done im back on columbia
and its no reflection on me that the captain wants you to oversee the work
thats right i was his chief engineer for four years
well it doesnt look like hes ready to let you go id better get on it
he thinks hes going to lose his promotion
is there anything i can do to help
with kelby
with the engine
i could use a second pair of eyes on the field matrix the patterns bothering me and i cant figure out why
ill take a look at it
thanks
commander have you been experiencing any unusual daydreams
daydreams
accompanied by intense auditory and visual sensations that would involve me
youre wondering if ive been having any daydreams about you
essentially
well let me think no nothing comes to mind
forget i mentioned it
have you been having daydreams about me
its not important
you going to tell me what this is about
no
i am a privateer my allegiance is to myself alone i earn my living in various ways buying selling
plundering
when the situation calls for it piracy is a risky business i prefer commerce this  is from a planet in the gorn hegemony
the gorn
the less said about them the better but they do brew the finest meridor in the five systems
delicious
im pleased you have acquired something of a reputation captain
favourable i hope
well youre wanted in the klingon empire the orion syndicate i dont know i would imagine such a man would have a more robust appetite
with all those people after me i need to stay quick on my feet
yes
you said you had something important to discuss with us
well its poor custom to discuss business before entertainment if the food didnt arouse your hunger this should
what do you think
i cant think
captain
id have to agree with my tactical officer
i think she likes you
her name is navaar shes the most experienced of the three theyre sisters i purchased them at a trading post you once visited incredible arent they they can make you forget most of your troubles of course creatures such as these come with troubles of their own but women are the same throughout the galaxy arent they
now we can talk business
he claims hes discovered a planet with large deposits of magnesite enough to build a thousand warp reactors and thats just what his scanners could detect hes offering to give us the coordinates
why would he divulge this information
he doesnt have the infrastructure to get the magnesite out of the ground
so he wants starfleet to construct mining facilities
and hell get a tenpercent share hes also promised to help establish a dialogue between starfleet and the orion syndicate
are you going to accept his offer
i already have
i thought you were here seeking my advice
harradsar insisted that i accept a gift to celebrate the transaction given the situation i couldnt refuse
were on d deck now where most of the crew quarters are located
where does captain archer stay
on e thats one deck below us
how many levels are there
um er a total of seven seven decks weve arranged these for you
you need something to do the other two rooms are right next door ill show you in a moment
captain archer has a very large ship
its roomy
but everythings so functional theres no colour
i hadnt really thought about it to tell you the truth
at least its private whats your name
lieutenant reed malcolm
pleased to meet you lieutenant reed malcolm
malcolm is fine well someone will be by shortly to show you how everything works in the meantime just try to make yourself at home right this way ladies
ive been hearing some concerns from the crew
concerns
the orion women their presence is becoming disruptive
youre telling me the crew isnt used to having orions on board
its more than that our guests visited the mess hall this morning as a result twelve crewmen reported late for their shifts
i get the picture
its primarily their attire
or lack of it  ill see about assigning them some clothes
it might also be a good idea if you have a word with them theyre still under the impression they belong to you unless a new policy has been instated i believe starfleet doesnt condone slavery
ill speak to them first chance i get
thank you
lieutenant
have you seen them yet
i ran into one of them in the corridor theyre really
yeah i know i know what are you trying to do
get them out of my head the pain helps you should try it
yeah okay
when i was on my parents ship we picked up some deltans once their ship was having engine trouble
i dont know that species
the females are unbelievably attractive very open about
i was fifteen i couldnt think straight i could barely breathe only thing that got me through it was weight training with my dad he said if i was exhausted idle hands and all that
well did it help
helped my biceps id go heavier
what are you doing here
i wanted to thank you you were very kind this morning helping me find the mess hall
it was no problem look i
wow is that the engine
its the warp reactor
you can feel the power you promised youd show me engineering
i know
harradsar never let us leave our rooms ive never seen anything like this place
i could show you around
if it wont get you into trouble
come on
whatve you got for a headache
that depends on whats causing it how long have you been experiencing this
a few hours what is it
ensign keeley was here with a headache several minutes ago
is she all right
perfectly just as you are
its probably just stress
theres been plenty of that going around
or it could be our new passengers
the orion females why should they give you a headache
im just not used to seeing guys trip over themselves like that
just a little healthy sexual energy helps keep the blood pumping
if you ask me its pumping a little too hard
im surprised at you ensign
why
you never struck me as being prone to jealousy this should do very nicely
phlox
its all right well i must be nearing a sleep cycle
i thought you just had one
youre right i did a week ago
its a good bet the problems right there take it apart
the injectors feed into the dilithium chamber
thats where the matter and antimatter mix
thats right
the crystals let you control the reaction
thats right
lieutenant talk to you a second
whats going on
sir
youre supposed to be recalibrating the eps taps not giving a tour
shes only been here a couple of minutes
not to mention the fact that she doesnt have clearance you shouldve checked with me first
well i guess i cant do anything right
just ask her to leave
no sir im not through talking to her
that was an order
and im refusing
what the hells the matter with you
youve been on my case since the second you got back thats what the hells the matter with me and im telling you it stops here
kelby youre walking a fine line
so are you commander
youre confined to quarters
and what if i dont want to go
its either your quarters or the brig get out of here now
come in
i was wondering when you were going to come see me after all ive been your property for two days
navaar you and your sisters dont belong to me or anyone else
i dont understand
on my world slaverys been illegal for hundreds of years
are you saying that you dont want us
im saying that youre here as our guests not our property
ive been a slave my entire life on different worlds for different owners whats going to happen to me
youre free to start a new life in the meantime ive asked my protocol officer hoshi sato to brief you on ships operations there are certain areas that are reserved for starfleet personnel
i know what happened in engineering ive already spoken to dnesh im sorry
theres no reason to apologise its a big adjustment for the three of you
may i ask you something
do you find me attractive
id be lying if i said no
ive known so few honest men and even though you dont wish to own me i still wish to please you if i choose to do this  would that violate your ships protocol
not necessarily
bridge to captain archer bridge to captain archer
archer here
were coming up on the planet
ill be right there
i recommend we go to tactical alert sir we cant be certain this isnt some kind of a trap
go ahead
were already picking up large deposits of magnesite
harradsar was telling the truth
it would seem so
keep scanning i want to know how much is down there
are you feeling all right
im fine
a power reading not on the surface in the upper atmosphere
a ship
uncertain
try hailing them
the cloud layer is highly ionised its obscuring our scanners
get us closer within ten kilometres
theyre not responding
there it is
its an unknown configuration
theyre locking weapons extremely low yield barely scratched us
its equipped with numerous sensors most likely a science vessel its presence here could simply be a coincidence
theyre firing again no damage they could shoot at us all day
phase cannons
sir
a phase cannon hit will destroy them
which means they wont be shooting at us anymore
if we simply withdraw theyll most likely cease their attack and move off
and maybe they wont target them lieutenant
captain
lock phase cannons
no
sir theyre moving off
i have just as much experience im smarter younger
youre better than him
were the only ones who think that
tuckers going to take back his position
he denies it but i know hes planning on staying
it doesnt seem fair
it isnt lets not talk about it anymore
what
im used to being with men who take what they want
what are you talking about
you cant let him treat you like this
hes my superior officer
where are you going
i thought you were different
stay wait dont leave
what would you do to keep me forever
forever
what would you do
anything anything you want
kelby what the hell are you doing
blow the dampeners move
he blew out every junction in the eps system if we hadnt got to him we might not have a ship under our feet
when can we get underway
im not sure we can get underway he did a pretty thorough job
kelby
i didnt do anything
tell me what happened
whatever he told you its a lie
three other people were there they all saw you tell me why you did this
hes trying to get rid of me dont listen to him
kelby
captain his adrenaline levels are dangerously high i need to administer a sedative
not till i get some answers first
in his current state he cant give you coherent answers
i just want to go back to engineering
all right
i just want to go back to engineering
be quiet
whats wrong with him
its the same thing thats affecting everyone on this ship its a highly potent pheromone when exposed to human males it accelerates the metabolism causing aggression and ultimately a form of delusion
the orions
women aboard the ship have also been affected ive received an increasing number of complaints about headaches and listlessness i suspect the pheromone acts as a defence mechanism against competition
you okay
its impacted my sleep cycle im having to rely on stimulants to stay awake
doesnt seem to be affecting you
ive scanned a good number of the crew so far the only people who havent been affected are tpol and commander tucker
why me
i would have to run some more tests but for the rest of us the effect seems to be cumulative the longer were exposed the more pronounced the results are
so this is what you meant when you said we were free to start new lives
we found this in your quarters
it seems we have no privacy either
its a communication device youve been in contact with harradsar as recently as two hours ago
and if i have
you were sent here to disable my ship that was his plan from the start wasnt it
harradsar contacted me to see if weve been treated well
doctor phlox believes that prolonged exposure to your pheromones makes men delusional and extremely vulnerable to suggestion thats how you convinced kelby to sabotage our engines
your crewman acted alone i had nothing to do with it
it seems the only delusion here is your own
damn it its time to start telling me the truth
im worried about you captain you dont seem well
im not the one you should be worried about
i can see youre not very experienced at making threats
im a lot better at carrying them out
we were a gift nothing more a true commander would know how to appreciate such a gesture
tell me whens he going to attack us
no one is coming to attack your ship
please release us
captain
im obviously not the only woman with power over you
get down to engineering do what you can to help trip
its better if i stay on the bridge
i dont need you to look after me
youre not immune to these pheromones your judgment is impaired
i can handle it we need to get the engines back online i dont want to be a sitting duck when harradsar gets here you have your orders
the captain asked me to offer my assistance
great you can run through these diagnostics see if you can find anything that isnt fried you really think theyre coming after us
its likely the transmissions sent by the orion females suggest that harradsars ship is getting closer
you know i keep thinking back to our first mission when we met the suliban i was so damn naive i actually thought it was the last time wed have to fight someone
i said leave it alone
get your hands off me
knock if off thats an order start up again and youll end up in the brig understand now go help masarro with the injectors now  get back to work thats the third one in the last hour
there have been altercations throughout the ship the captains been affected im concerned about him
the thing i cant figure out is why im immune
that might have something to do with me
you
theres a longheld belief that when a vulcan mates theres a shared psychic bond
we didnt mate okay what do you mean by psychic bond
its difficult to explain feelings thoughts even images can be shared
those daydreams
what
when i said before that i wasnt having any daydreams about you it wasnt actually true so if were bonded what does this have to do with me not being affected by the orions
im immune to the pheromones because of my vulcan physiology
and youre making me immune
apparently
i dont know whether to be relieved or really worried
tactical alert distance
four hundred kilometres
hes hailing us
put him up
can i be of help captain do you need a tow
hes trying to knock out our weapons
then take out his
forward phase cannons are down
protect our aft cannons
hes moving too fast
archer to engineering
trip
can we get more power
to the thrusters
ill see what i can do
we just lost aft cannons
try to divert some of the power from the grav plating
were going to be a little lighter on our feet what the hell ive been meaning to lose a few pounds
reducing gravity plating to ninety percent
thrusters are back to full
hard to starboard
were still too slow
torpedoes
that last hit just took them out
hes powering down his weapons
hes coming about
thrusters full astern
its not enough
hes hailing
relax captain enjoy the ride
were not going anywhere
im afraid you have an appointment with a pair of orion marauders i dont intend to keep them waiting
release my ship
i can see youre upset and i sympathise but its truly out of my hands we are both slaves to the situation
they control you
you finally realise that yes captain youve been operating under a misconception it is the men who are the slaves not the women
you seeing what im seeing
his grapplers directly above our main deflector reader
get up to the bridge ill be right behind you
the deflector
we can use it to send a positron burst through the towing cable if were lucky itll trigger an energy cascade
and disable his power systems do it
tpol to engineering
ive almost got it youll have to reroute the main eps conduit
understood
captain
captain
decon chamber come in
theres no one there
what did you do to my men
we asked them to leave after they released us
they were very accommodating
get off my bridge
is that what you really want because if it is i will gladly do as you say i only want to make you happy i didnt think you wanted me to go
captain
shes jealous shell try anything to keep us apart shell even destroy your ship
her presence is affecting your judgment
arrest her
dont listen
do it
captain
lieutenant reed
yes
take tpol to the brig
you heard your captain
aye sir
stop him
were ready
his engines are down weapons as well it worked
commander tucker im impressed im beginning to see whos the true master of this vessel
oh save it captain archer runs this ship youre sweettalking the wrong guy lets go
okay
the dizziness should fade in a couple of hours
glad to hear that
at least the pheromones are wearing off i havent thought about the orions for what a whole ten minutes
the entire crews been bumping into walls its like someone spiked the water supply
the after effects will be around for at least a few days
well done
thank you captain
youll be glad to know my log wont mention your firing on a fellow officer
i appreciate that
a courtmartial would hardly be a fitting ending to this incident at least weve learned something about the orions
yeah the women are in charge
it proves that even the most disagreeable species have some positive attributes
was that my imagination
i dont think so
it almost sounded like you were making a joke
at least trying to make one
i assure you if i ever decide to make a joke youll know about it
there it is again
tpol if i didnt know better id think you were picking up some of trips bad habits
i guess we proved it again
proved what
that you and i make a hell of a team
we do seem to work well together
even more now that were in each others heads
youre returning to columbia
i imagine captain hernandez is getting pretty antsy to have her chief engineer back
there are still numerous repairs to be carried out here
i think kelby can handle them hed been observing my work pretty carefully when he wasnt trying to blow up the ship
kelby is a fine engineer but he lacks experience
why dont you just say it
say what
that you want me to come back
i believe i did i think your presence here would be extremely beneficial to our operations
no that you want me back
i dont know what you mean
my mistake see you around
wait trip i want you to come back
then ill think about it
trip
three days ago i told captain hernandez i wanted a transfer back to enterprise
three days ago
i realised this is where i was meant to be and that this thing between us isnt that big of a deal
agreed
guess we got a lot of work to do
live long and prosper
board that ship take everything you can
the booth will be far more effective than our previous disciplinary methods
it can stimulate the pain centre of virtually any humanoid a synaptic scan calibrates it for each species
they call this progress
theres something to be said for a good oldfashioned flogging
well thats whats so exceptional about this device traditional forms of punishment can overwhelm the nervous system after a time the brain ceases to feel anything
these sensors continually shift the stimulation from one nerve cluster to another keeping the subject in a constant state of agony
i think you enjoy your work too much doctor
what exactly did mister terev do
im not certain i suspect he was late for his duty shift arent all tellarites guilty of something
did you get a chance to look over my proposal
i read it
and
were going to rendezvous with the fleet as ordered im not going into tholian space based on data from some anonymous source maybe you havent heard but we have a rebellion to put down the tholians arent part of it
you saw the data this technology would give us a tactical advantage we could end the war tomorrow
you see this as your big chance dont you
sir
you bring that ship home and youll be a hero the emperor pins a medal on your chest you might even get that command youve always wanted
my only concern is saving the empire
resume your station
captain youre making a mistake
you can either go back to the bridge or take the place of that tellarite which do you prefer
understood
what do you think youre doing
reviewing status reports
this is supposed to be your sanctuary a place to get away from status reports
youre the one person on this ship that i dont mind giving in to
and probably the only one who doesnt want to slip a knife in your back i heard the battle went well at tau ceti
is that what you heard
word on the ship is the war may be over soon ill go back to brazil start teaching again youll accept a comfortable desk job at headquarters well have the weekends
youve been listening to propaganda things went badly at tau ceti very badly we lost twelve ships keep this to yourself if the crew learns what really happened
forget about the war this is our time
dont
youll hang for this
lock him in the brig
sir let me take him down to the cargo bay ill finish him quickly quietly
i want him alive
still itd be tragic if there was an accident on the way to the brig
if anything happens to forrest ill shoot you myself are we clear major
perfectly sir
stand aside commander
wheres captain forrest  contact security
this is first officer archer in accordance with starfleet orders this date
ive relieved captain forrest of duty and assumed command of enterprise my orders are to
take the ship into tholian space for a mission of vital importance to the empire i cant reveal the details of our assignment but i can tell you this
if were successful starfleet will crush the rebellion once and for all
no crew in starfleet has been tested more in battle i know i can count on each of you to perform your duty to the best of your ability nothing will impede our march toward victory long live the empire
long live the empire
weve received no such communiqués from starfleet command
it was sent on a private channel
id like to see those orders
all in good time alter our heading two one five mark thirteen maximum warp
yes captain
corporal escort commander tpol to cargo bay two youll find a suliban cloaking device there bring it to engineering and help tucker install it were going to need the cloak to complete this mission
these orders appear to be authentic
appear all i require from you is your loyalty do i have it
you are in command
im glad we can agree on something do you recognise this  it belonged to zefram cochrane he used it to kill the first vulcan who stepped onto terran soil i wonder how history would have played out if cochrane hadnt turned the tables on your invasion force humans might be your slaves instead of the other way around
im not a slave
youre vulcan never forget that how long until we cross into tholian space
its likely we already have they frequently annex systems outside their core territory
theres a warp signature encoded on this notify me the moment you find it
if theres nothing further
there is im promoting you to first officer
major reeds next in line he wont be pleased
reed is a capable soldier but he has trouble following orders and i know he has ambitions of his own
youve made it clear you dont approve of vulcans
maybe this is my way of saying thank you to you and your people without vulcan technology the empire wouldnt be where it is today dismissed
serving as my personal guard will have its privileges youll have your own quarters better food youll accept orders from me and me alone is that clear
yes sir and captain if i may id like to be the first to congratulate you on a brilliant strategy im certain that in years to come
you already have the job sergeant dont talk yourself out of it  dont mind porthos he hasnt had his dinner yet  come in
thatll be all
you didnt receive a communiqué from starfleet i would have known if something came through a mutiny didnt think you had it in you
ill take that as a compliment
wheres captain forrest
hes safe
how do i know that you didnt push him out of an airlock
i want to talk to him
not right now hell remain alive as long as you dont cause any trouble no hidden distress signals to starfleet i need you and your expertise
is that all you need youve never forgiven me for leaving im sorry if i hurt you
you saw an opportunity for advancement and you took it
just as you did you shouldve been captain from the moment we left spacedock youve always known that if it hadnt been for all those admirals conspiring behind your back enterprise would have been yours tradition says that whatever belonged to the previous captain is yours for the taking
ive never been one to argue with tradition
tpol to captain archer
maybe we should keep our relationship on a professional level
captain archer please respond
go ahead
were approaching the warp signature
on my way i expect you to be in a better mood when i get back
captain on the bridge
were closing on target twenty thousand kilometres
theres one biosign aboard tholian
power the tractor emitters
hes seen us hes arming weapons
disable his ship i dont want the pilot injured
done
theres an overload building in his reactor
major
it wasnt my doing sir i targeted his weapons only
i believe the pilot may be attempting to destroy his own ship
lock on the transporter beam him into the decon chamber
captain
we have the pilot
archer to sickbay we beamed a tholian into decon
modify the atmosphere in there
it may take a moment tholians have rather extreme life support requirements increasing temperature to four hundred and eighty kelvin
if youre angry now just wait
how is he
how is it would be more accurate tholians possess both male and female characteristics its biosigns such as they are appear to be stable
will it understand me
im captain archer youre on board the terran flagship enterprise answer my questions or you will be harmed
its demanding to be released
i want to know where youre holding the terran vessel you captured
my people will find your ship and destroy it
a minor adjustment to life support should make it more cooperative decreasing temperature fifty degrees
tell me what i want to know
something about your maternal ancestor
take it down another fifty
its exoskeleton is beginning to fracture
i agree i agree
go on
the ship is in the vintaak system at a facility orbiting the gas giant
what the hell is that
a shortrange transmission
a distress signal you think it has a comm device in there
its crystalline structure may act as a natural transmitter
sir i recommend we beam it into space immediately
no i need to keep it alive for now until i can verify what its told us find some way to knock that thing out
yes captain
you forget something biggs get the commander a radiation meter you dont want to end up like me do you ive absorbed enough delta rays to guarantee my grandchildren glow in the dark
flux coupler
they say for every year you spend next to one of these things you lose a decade off your life expectancy which means ill probably be dead by the end of the week
you should speak to captain archer about a promotion
well youre his first officer you could talk to him for me
why would i do that
i did you a favour once
we agreed never to discuss that
and i havent
id hardly call it a favour you enjoyed yourself
several times as i recall so how many years is it until your pon farr comes around again
where the hells that coming from
pull the matrix converters
can you repair the cloak
itll take at least a day
you have six hours
there are dozens of eps feeds on this deck and the only one that overloads is the one connected to the cloaking device
the power surge disabled other systems internal sensors are down weve lost gravplating on g deck
the cloaks your first priority  someones responsible for what happened find out who
my people can investigate this i dont need his kind crawling around pulling relays
get the cloak online
who sabotaged the cloak
was something damaged
i know admiral black has an agent on enterprise i want the name
you really think that the admiral would plant a spy on my ship and then tell me who it is
go to his quarters search his personal files look for messages from starfleet
follow his orders and youll be executed as a coconspirator
aye captain
this isnt like you jonathan you never lusted for power and glory thats why i trusted you at my side for all these years because you have no ambition
if thats right then why are you in the brig
release me and i promise your death will be quick you wont get that guarantee from the admiral kill me and shell never forgive you
the saboteur entered this junction and deliberately overloaded this eps waveguide
that junctions supposed to be offlimits
the intruder alarms were disabled
how
theres only one way i know of by running a highlevel diagnostic scan commander tucker initiated a scan thirty minutes before the overload
who ordered you to sabotage the cloak
i didnt
reed ill kill you when i get out of this
id like to see you try
i checked the records admiral black recommended you for chief engineer he insisted forrest replace his own man with you youre working for the admiral arent you what have you told him
captain youve got it all wrong it wasnt me
what have you told him
please captain ive always been loyal to you
break him
it hasnt been that good in a long time the things a girl will give up for her career
the data i gave you did you transmit it to the fleet admiral
of course what was it
insurance policy
whats wrong
tuckers a competent engineer if he wanted to damage the cloak he could have done a much better job
well it couldnt have been easy with tpol looking over his shoulder
computer locate commander tpol
unable to comply internal sensors are offline
the sensors were damaged by the overload
whats going on
stay here
i wondered what was keeping you
i needed time to find help
no alarm
ive disabled the internal sensors and the comm system
well take the bridge first
set a course out of tholian space maximum warp
i cant alter our heading
full stop
the helms not responding
having trouble
you did this
autonavigation cant be released until weve reach the coordinates ive set
restore the controls now
i cant theyve been encrypted with a random code
can you override the helm
itll take several days to break the encryption
well arrive at the coordinates long before then  the bridge is yours captain
ten hours in the booth impressive
get him out of there
bring major reed i want him to spend some time in this invention of his
you going to shoot me now or wait for courtmartial
fleet admiral gardners ordered you released he received the data you sent him the admiral finds your suggestion intriguing since youve already locked us on this course ive been ordered to investigate your mystery ship you betrayed me dont think for one moment im going to forget that get cleaned up youre briefing the senior staff in an hour
a parallel universe the science directorate has examined all of these theories theyve found no evidence of alternate realities
the tholians are a little more openminded than your people they detonated a tricobalt warhead here inside the gravity well of a dead star the explosion created an interphasic rift a doorway into another universe
a doorway
the rift was unstable it was too dangerous to send one of their own ships through so they transmitted a distress call into the opening hoping to lure a ship from the other side their plan worked brilliantly
how did you learn all this
the tholians rely on outside labourers humanoids some of them can be bought for the right price
i hope you didnt pay too much
my contact transmitted these images before his signal was jammed
you can barely see anything
computer enhance grid three alpha
an earth ship
according to some theories everything that exists in our universe should also exist there
another terran empire another starfleet
so what how does this help us
the tholians quantumdated a piece of the hull this ship is not only from another universe its from another time about a hundred years into the future imagine the technology we can find on that ship new tactical systems advanced bioweapons engines that can reach speeds we can only dream of all of it ours for the taking
this is ludicrous captain someone has fabricated this evidence to lure us here commander archer is guilty of assault and mutiny
thats enough commander
sir i believe we should send
i said shut up were investigating this get that cloaking device working
the captain wants a progress report
ill need another minute to calibrate the field converters i spent four hours in the booth because of you
perhaps you should direct your anger at commander archer
you disabled the alarms in that junction and made it look like i did it
youre mistaken
the hell i am i think id remember if i had sabotaged the ship
not necessarily
what did you do to me
i lured you away from engineering with the promise of a sexual encounter
my mind to your mind
once we were alone in my quarters i implanted a telepathic suggestion
my thoughts to your thoughts
i compelled you to sabotage the power grid
after you completed the assignment we melded again i altered your memory of what had happened it was my duty to help captain forrest regain command
youre going to regret what you did
threats are illogical
engineering to bridge
go ahead
were ready
im going to have to channel everything except auxiliary power
engage the cloak
weve reached the coordinates autonavigation has disengaged
lets see where we are
magnify the moon on the far right
primary systems are offline including life support were reading thirteen biosigns all alien one of them appears to be reptilian theyre clustered in this section
any sign of the crew
weve detected no human signatures
its likely the crew was executed
look at the size of those coils ill bet that thing could do warp seven
well send an assault team aboard you brought us here you lead it download whatever you can from the database then destroy the ship
destroy it we have to take the ship with us
its too dangerous we are deep in tholian space
sir you cant do this
you have your orders dismissed
go with him i dont want archer to return from this mission do i make myself clear commander
someones removed these components
theyre gutting the ship
human
if youd like sir i could hold that for you
nap time isnt over yet
im picking up a transmission its coming from decon
bridge to phlox
whats happening down there
the sedative is no longer working
well then kill it now
with pleasure
three ships are moving toward our position
doctor
a few more seconds captain will you kindly die
phlox to bridge
you wont be having any further trouble from our guest
one of the tholian ships is hailing us
this must be the captain
his necks broken
we should be able to overload the reactor from here
get started
four more ships
contact archer tell him to abort the mission lay in a course out of here
theyre jamming us
target the nearest ship fire
no damage
torpedo launchers fire when ready
they can see us
get us out of here engineering disengage the cloak and transfer all power to engines
the cloaks not responding sir
how much longer
maybe youd like to take a stab at it
i can activate their systems
stand aside commander
almost there
enterprise is under attack
hull platings down weve lost power on decks c d and e
engineering to bridge the containment fields are failing
can you vent the antimatter
negative reactor breach in three minutes
this is the captain all hands to escape pods abandon ship you heard my order
what do you think youre doing
ill buy you as much time as i can get out of here now
enterprise is taking heavy damage
can you bring weapons and engines online
ill see what i can do
give me a hand with them
commander
commander
youve got thrusters
release the docking clamps
i cant
what about weapons
this power grids a mess its going to take a few minutes
sir the shields are functional
raise them
our shields are weakening the clamps but theyre still holding
ill alternate port and starboard thrusters that should shake them loose
were free
firing aft thrusters
six tholian ships moving toward us
how much longer for weapons
the power couplings have been removed i dont know if i can bypass them
sir
mister tucker
stand by i could use some help over here  when i tell you shunt the plasma to the forward emitters
three more ships approaching
just a few more seconds
what was that
theyve locked on a tractor beam were being pulled back into the dock
its now or never
stand by now
tactical systems are online
full thrusters
the remaining ships are retreating
the stations opened fire
does this thing have aft torpedoes
you better believe it theyre armed
escape pods twelve kilometres off the port bow theyre ours
bring them onboard
we need warp drive
engineerings been stripped to the bulkheads but the good news is most of what they took was still sitting in my hangar deck but i need time to figure out how to put it all back together
how much time
two or three days sir im not even sure what some of these systems are supposed to do its like im chief engineer on a steamship coming aboard the first interplanetary transport
if we dont have warp capability in twelve hours im going to find a new chief engineer
i suggest we make use of the alien workers they may know something about these systems
keep them under close surveillance once warp drive is restored well set a course to rendezvous with the assault fleet
were in no condition for battle
we made quick work of the tholians
this ship is designed to be operated by a crew of four hundred there are only forty seven of us the logical course of action is to take defiant to earth allow starfleet to study it reverseengineer its systems
theres no time the empire could lose this war in a matter weeks if we dont get the defiant and its weapons to the front lines dismissed commander  not you
i should shoot you for betraying me
the orders giving you command of enterprise were obviously fabricated it was my duty as a starfleet officer to help captain forrest regain control of his ship
you swore your loyalty to me
you should be aware captain forrest ordered me to kill you
why are you telling me this
forrest is dead his orders are no longer valid you are my commanding officer
i never had a problem with your people until they became a part of this rebellion if i had another officer capable of doing your job id show you to the nearest airlock i need you to get this ship up and running but if i hear so much as a rumour that youre working behind my back
understood
get out
what are you wearing
i found it in the captains wardrobe
these people had some strange ideas about uniforms
i cant find a mention of it anywhere
a mention of what
the empire as far as i can tell it doesnt exist in the other universe
no empire
a lot of the names are the same but their history has been rewritten instead of building an empire earth became part of an interspecies alliance
the united federation of planets
more like a federation of fools
what about us do we exist in this universe
computer access biographical file starfleet officer hoshi sato
working
hoshi sato comm officer on starfleets first warp five ship in her late thirties she created the linguacode translation matrix
at least she was remembered for something
i can tell you who she married it even says how you died
stop i dont want to know
but this isnt you
i dont care computer display file on starfleet officer jonathan archer
working
son of famed warp specialist henry archer jonathan was appointed captain of starfleets first warp five ship his name is among the most recognised in the federation he earned an impressive list of commendations during his career historians called him the greatest explorer of the twenty second century two planets were named after him
hey
theres nothing great about that man he sold out earths future to a group of subhuman species great men are not peacemakers great men are conquerors
forget about him your future is just beginning can you imagine the look on the emperors face when he sees this ship youll be declared hero of the empire starfleetll have to give you a command of your own
i already have a command of my own
whats the problem
commander somebody pulled both plasma regulators out of these housings
why are you bothering me with this theyre probably on the hangar deck
no sir you dont understand they were here ten minutes ago i went to get this coupler when i came back the regulators were gone
youd better find them because if this junctions not on line in ten minutes im going to tell archer youre the reason we dont have warp drive
yes yes sir
whos in here
i found traces of reptilian saliva in the ensigns wounds
something bit him
the bite radius would suggest a particularly large reptile more than two metres in length
can you find this thing on internal sensors
its not in the primary hull sensors are still offline on the engineering decks
perhaps it was a pet owned by one of the original crew
unless one of them owned a velociraptor i find it extremely unlikely
theres no sign of the regulators without them we cant initialise the reaction chamber were stuck at impulse
whoever sabotaged us knew exactly which components to steal
the slaves we captured bring one of them to the briefing room
certainly sir
what attacked my crewman
he promised hed kill us if we told you
ill kill you now if you dont
please
stand aside
tpol to major reed bring another prisoner to the briefing room
acknowledged
from what im told the maximum setting can actually disintegrate a person ive been looking forward to trying it
his name is slar
whos name
our slave master he was in charge of the salvage operation when you boarded the ship he hid in the service crawlways he was planning to sabotage the ship
where in the crawlways
possibly near the power transfer conduits on deck twenty two its warm there his species likes it warm
what species
gorn hes hes a gorn
we had it cornered in turboshaft three but it appears to have escaped through this access tube thats when we lost contact with mckenzie and browne
theyre taking too long when my ship was in jeopardy i didnt let security handle the situation i took care of it myself
id have better luck sending a squad of tellarites to capture this thing put an assault team together ill lead it myself
sir im picking up a signal from inside the ship i think its the reptile
can you pinpoint its location
the frequencys scrambled
i want to talk to it
the translator matrix is tied in
this is captain archer return our plasma regulators now
i want to leave this ship
give me what i want and well talk
no im familiar with your species humans are not trustworthy
you will give me a shuttlecraft once im away from this ship
ill tell you where to find the regulators
this is not a negotiation the regulators now if you dont comply ill give the order
he closed the channel
major get the team together your best men
the gorns offer is reasonable
he has no intention of returning the regulators if we give him a shuttle hell contact his people and come back here with a warship without warp drive well be an easy target
defeat this gorn and youll finally earn the respect you deserve
theres a biosign very faint in access tube seven alpha near junction three
ill seal off the bulkhead here thatll leave him with only one escape route flush him out drive him into this junction ill be waiting for him
understood
reed to captain archer
go ahead
its not here
hes modified a communicator to emit a false biosign
meet us in junction three
acknowledged
shut that bloody thing off
its a trap
ive failed you captain
archer to tpol where is it
the gorns moved into the primary hull
its on deck nine
were going to plan b access the environmental controls on that deck wait for my signal
acknowledged
archer to tpol section four a on my mark
standing by
now
enhancing gravplating
gravplatings at twenty gs
give me your weapon
whats major reeds condition
at this point he could go either way no doubt therell be several discreet celebrations if he should expire
i notice youve been making extensive use of the library database
i was merely researching classical literature i wanted to compare our major works with their counterparts in the other universe i skimmed a few of the more celebrated narratives the stories were similar in some respects but their characters were weak and compassionate with the exception of shakespeare of course from what i could tell his plays were equally grim in both universes
examine their historical files you may want to learn more about their federation did you know in the other universe humans and denobulans are considered equals as are vulcans you dont find this interesting
i find it dangerous if i were the captain id restrict access to that database im certain he wouldnt want to give his crew any ideas
perhaps you should reconsider the repercussions
this is the captain all hands to battle stations
report
hull breach on b deck emergency bulkheads are engaged
concentrate your fire on the andorians
hull platings at thirty two percent admiral theres another vessel approaching
more rebels
no
direct hits
the tellarite ships opened fire no damage
lock on their reactor fire when ready
target destroyed
the vulcan ships trying to escape
pursuit course
captain theyre no threat to us i recommend we
fire when ready
the last andorian ship is retreating
weapons are locked
no let them go i want the other rebels to know what happened here get me admiral black
archer
sorry were late for the party admiral
wheres enterprise is captain forrest with you
its going to take some time to explain sir perhaps youd like to see the defiant for yourself
a most impressive vessel commander with the technology on this ship at our disposal the rebels wont stand a chance
glad you agree sir
i intend to recommend that you get your own command at the earliest opportunity
respectfully sir you have the authority to grant a battlefield promotion
unfortunately we dont have a ship to give you at the moment
the defiant
im sure the fleet admiral has other plans for this ship
theyre never going to give you this ship you know that theyll tear it apart try to learn its secrets if youre lucky youll end up commanding a moon shuttle dont you see what the admirals planning hes going to present this ship to the emperor himself hell take all the credit and youll end up a historical footnote
once we reach earth well disassemble its tactical systems our experts will want to examine  with any luck we should be able to replicate the phase cannons and upgrade  the rebels wont know what hit them what youve accomplished could alter the course of the war the people of the earth are in your debt commander
thats captain youre relieved admiral
our entire assault fleet wiped out by a rebel attack thousands of your fellow starfleet officers dead if the defiant hadnt arrived when it did all of you would be among them and who are we to blame for this not the brave men and women who gave their lives for the empire the criminals who are losing this war are sitting in their comfortable offices back at starfleet command their weakness invited our enemies to strike and their corruption and arrogance have brought the empire to the brink of defeat ive been a soldier all my life and i will not stand by and let these people destroy an empire that has endured for centuries i ask you all of you to join me we cannot put down this rebellion so long as our forces are commanded by dishonourable men before we can defeat the rebels we must defeat them that ship out there is the key to our victory with the defiant on our side there will be nothing to stop us
long live the empire
shoot the first one who stops applauding
enter
its not wise to make that gesture even behind closed doors it is agreeable to see you again
did you review the historical files
the implications are intriguing
intriguing
this alternate universe is very different from ours im not certain a federation could ever exist here
i thought you were an idealist
that was many years ago
we have to take action archer intends to overthrow starfleet and the emperor
not for our people the weapons on that ship will annihilate the rebels including thousands of vulcans we can give them an advantage
how
i can download the data on defiants engines and tactical systems well give it to them
data will be of little value archer still controls that ship
im going to destroy that ship
what
i can disable defiants power systems but ill need your help do you want to spend the rest of your life serving the empire
im too old to become a revolutionary
i know archer he blames our people for inciting the rebels if he becomes emperor hell lay waste to vulcan i cant do this without you
my senior officers dont think i can do this
theyll come around
tpol doesnt approve either i can see it in her eyes
maybe its time to get rid of her now that this ships operational
not just her well get rid of all the nonterrans ill transfer them off defiant
all of them
the rebels have spies everywhere i cant afford to have a single alien aboard my flagship
i hope youre not planning on getting sick anytime soon in case you havent noticed your doctor is an alien
ive got nothing against phlox his people arent rebels its not in their nature he can stay
ive never been the consort of an emperor before is there anything i need to know
i think you i think youve got the basics down
put me through to fleet admiral gardner corporal escort commander tpol to transporter room two your service aboard this ship is no longer required
archer what the hell is going on
i take it you received my message
you demanded starfleets unconditional surrender have you lost your mind
youve seen the specs on the defiant you know what its weapons can do
i want to speak with admiral black
hes not available right now i suggest you order your forces to stand down starfleet cant afford to lose any more ships
this is your only warning commander do not approach earth or you will be fired upon
bridge to doctor phlox
this is phlox
theres a medical emergency on the avenger youre needed immediately
acknowledged
neither of you appears to be injured
youre the only nonterran on the defiant any of us would arouse suspicion
you heard archers speech hes delusional
its not a delusion if the captain has the power to do what he says and from what ive seen he most certainly does i should report you both
are you loyal to the empire or not
of course i am
archer plans to kill the emperor and take his place
the captain has proven himself in battle perhaps he should rule the empire
if archer fails his crew will have to answer for his crimes
well be executed theres an old tradition if someone saves the emperors life its said theres no request he can refuse them consider the possibilities a medical facility of your own with unlimited resources you could conduct experiments as you see fit
dont forget the females
females
youll be able to choose as many concubines as youd like
if the emperor were my patient id be obligated to save his life i suppose what youre suggesting isnt that different
whats this
save it commander the schematics you downloaded where are they
schematics
lets go
i was hoping youd put up a fight
im surprised youre not exhausted from all the beds youve jumped into recently
commander tucker told me i should give you a few pointers in that area
bring her
shut down the turbolifts  secure the bridge
who are you working with i hope youre prepared to die
my death will change nothing you will not prevail
the defiant will prevail its simply a matter of firepower
the federation is our future
youre mistaking our universe for someone elses
it may take centuries but humanity will pay for its arrogance
these interruptions arent helping
i need an estimate
the inside of this panel
doesnt look anything like the schematic you gave me
you need to remove the duotronic module
the relays are behind it
ive removed the module
you have to disengage the flow regulators before you remove the relays
or the plasma will ignite
someones trying to override the bridge lockouts doctor you must hurry
the warp fields fluctuating
its a power drain primary eps relays
ill alert the captain
no its probably just a microfracture in the conduit do you really want to interrupt the captain for that ill handle it  take over
yes sir
take a team aboard avenger confine every alien on that ship
theres no point in continuing shes not going to talk we should kill her
youve been looking forward to that for a while havent you
archer to the bridge report
main powers offline weve dropped out of warp
close to ten thousand metres target their primary hull
phlox to soval im finished here stand by to transport
what the hell have you done
i need weapons
everythings offline
continue firing
primary systems are coming back we have shields
raise them
soval to phlox
their power grids being restored whats happening doctor respond
weapons are online
destroy them
get us out of their weapons range divert all power to hull plating
theyve taken heavy damage
theyre trying to escape
photon torpedoes lock on to their reactor
before i forget first thing tomorrow i want you to erase the historical database i dont want anyone else getting any ideas about this federation of planets
well lose all the data on our counterparts
exactly
itll only take a day for the fleet to return to earth do you think the commanders will support you
theyre loyal to the emperor they dont really care who it is by the time the fleet arrives the reign of emperor jonathan archer will have already begun
once we put down the rebellion ill expand the empire throughout throughout
are you all right
open a channel to fleet admiral gardner
channel open
this is the starship defiant if you dont surrender immediately well begin targeting your cities respond
wheres archer who the hell are you
youre speaking with empress sato prepare to receive instructions
how serious
if the swelling gets worse it could inhibit her breathing
i told you to notify me if there was any trouble now you say this has been going on for days
the monitoring equipment didnt detect the symptoms until this morning
it isnt calibrated for this type of patient
well
fevers diminished shes fighting it off
thats good news for both of you
intravascular pressure has stabilised blood oxygenation is good
she looks so innocent its almost possible to forget what she represents
we dont want to disturb her
no
having endured a catastrophic world war earths governments came to this city for the purpose of creating a just and lasting peace among nations today we have assembled here again representatives of numerous worlds to forge an unprecedented alliance with this coalition of planets we seek to strengthen our bonds of friendship render permanent the peace that now exists among us for the ongoing exploration of our galaxy let us dedicate ourselves to these worthy goals so that future generations can look back upon this moment with pride and eternal gratitude thank you
people are watching
nobody knows that better than him
clap louder thats an order
i thought it was a fine speech
just missing a few names
youd think this was all his idea
its not about who gets credit
he couldve at least mentioned enterprise who does he think got the andorians and tellarites talking
im sure history will reflect our contribution
not if hes writing it
thats enough
i hope i didnt embarrass myself too much
far from it minister
call me nathan i want to thank you again for attending having enterprise here seems to put everyone at ease people feel comfortable in the presence of heroes
whatever we can do to help
well it certainly helps that the delegates can understand each other these universal translators work perfectly thanks to you
i just updated them with a few things we picked up on the mission
whatever you did theyre extremely precise though when im listening to the tellarite ambassador i wish they were just a little less precise
youve set a formidable goal the drafting of a charter in six weeks
ive always believed that formidable goals produce formidable results
i decided to stop waiting
for what
you to come over and say hello
you were busy working
we never had a problem mixing work and pleasure smile i never could get you to smile for the camera
how have you been gannet
busy there havent been many slow news days since the xindi attack i hear youre going to be in the neighborhood awhile
at least until the conference is over
we should get together if we wait another four years were going to have too much catching up to do
cant argue with that
ill pretend that was an enthusiastic yes back to work
commander tucker does have a point enterprise laid the foundation for this event perhaps it should be you theyre photographing
samuels likes the spotlight and hes welcome to it
theyre going to kill her
excuse me
dont let them
im sorry
its a phasepistol wound
shes going into shock get me a med kit
i just received word from starfleet medical the wound was too severe she didnt survive
do they think it could have been selfinflicted
they didnt say do we know who she was
her name was susan khouri she was a medical technician shed been having some emotional trouble took a leave from work over a year ago
any idea who the hair belonged to
i have a very good idea
it was from a child no more than six months old i used every dna identification protocol im aware of i even used a klingon procedure
go ahead
it contains vulcan and human dna i had the computer search for any matches in the starfleet databank when i got the results i ran the search three more times just to be certain
and
according to every analysis this child is the offspring of commander tucker and commander tpol
come in
we got to talk about this
its difficult to talk about something that doesnt make sense
phlox said dna doesnt lie
neither do i ive never been pregnant trip
then how do you explain all this
i cant do you believe me
yeah phlox must be wrong thats all there is to it if youve never been pregnant then you cant have a baby
trip the moment phlox said that the child was ours i knew it was true
but you said youd never been
i havent
then what are you saying
i cant explain how it exists but i know it does theres a child out there and its ours
how do you know that
im vulcan
fortunately the news hasnt spread to the general public and id like to keep it that way
if we made an announcement someone might come forward with information
an announcement of this nature could derail the conference
how
you havent spent much time on earth lately after the xindi attack there was a dangerous increase in xenophobia
we got a taste of it
it died down somewhat but not completely there are still people out there who want us to stay in our little corner of the galaxy the news of a vulcanhuman hybrid could inflame them give them something to rally against
i cant believe were talking about more than a small minority
as i said youve been away for a while
maybe i just have a little more faith in humanity than you do
cant afford to operate on faith theres more at stake here than a simple trade agreement you fought the xindi you know better than anyone how earths survival depends on alliances with other species we dont have the vulcans watching our backs anymore
this isnt about finding someone else to watch our backs
all im saying is that theres strength in numbers
all right i was hoping youd have some word on the investigation my engineer and science officer are eager to get some answers
im sure they are but ive heard nothing new
theres got to be something we can do
starfleet investigators are more than capable of handling this i suggest we let them do their job ill notify you the moment i hear something i appreciate your cooperation
reed
its captain archer i want you to talk to an old friend
the last time we spoke you asked me to never contact you again
i contacted you susan khouri
first we need an understanding
about what
that by speaking to me youre back in the game simple as that
who was she
she was more than just an emotionally troubled nurse she was a member of an underground isolationist movement terra prime
ive heard of them they want to stop all contact with alien species
they believe its corrupting our way of life
i remember they made a lot of noise back when enterprise was launched
they had a resurgence following the xindi attack we think khouri was trying to leave the movement
thats why they killed her
her defection may have had something to do with the child
i was getting to that
the child belongs to two of your crewmen you tell me
they claim they dont know anything about it
that doesnt seem likely does it
i believe them
i admire your loyalty we think terra prime is involved and that theyre planning something
you just dont know what
we suspect it has something to do with the child find it and well have the answers
you recruited her
i needed her expertise i thought she was reliable
obviously you were mistaken
if shed told them anything truly damaging i think wed know it by now
we cant be sure what she told them anyway im more concerned with why she turned away from us
i think that she might have become attached to the patient she spent a great deal of time caring for her
and what about you
me
yes youve spent as much time with that child as she did
i feel no differently about it than anyone else that ive treated
this isnt anyone else this is an abomination and when the time comes it will be treated as such
i understand
well im going to miss this place the simplicity theres no middle ground here and i can see the earth send in greaves on your way out
yes sir
i gave the men your message well be ready at a moments notice
tell them i appreciate their hard work
they already know
theres one other thing a loose end that needs tying up put together a group have them meet me at the third junction in say one hour
done
the tellarites are pushing for an embargo against the orions they claim theyve been attacking their freighters
we have traded with the orions for centuries we wouldve known of these attacks this is tellarite slander
you have to appreciate their point of view
the tellarites only want to deprive us of valuable commerce coridan will never agree to any trade sanctions
ambassador captain archer
ambassador
i need to contact my government about the todays developments excuse me
how can i help you
i want everything starfleet has on the investigation
why come to me
because the chief investigator turned me down you can change his mind
i cant do that im sorry
susan khouri was a member of terra prime
if thats true its extremely troubling
not as troubling as something else we learned you were once a member
it seems youre doing fairly well investigating on your own
thats why you wanted this kept quiet
ive already explained why there was a need for secrecy i was very young when i joined terra prime
you were eighteen
didnt you make any questionable choices when you were that age captain it was a stupid mistake i was a fool my father had died in a freighter accident and i blamed the pilot who happened to be denobulan we all have our demons ive exorcised mine
i dont care what you did when you were young minister i need your help
i underestimated you i suppose im not the first person to make that mistake youll have your case file within the hour
thank you
i cant decide if i like you better in uniform or not
what are you doing here
ive been assigned to do a story on enterprise they can build a ship that goes faster than light but they cant give you a decentsized room
a story
its told from the perspective of the crew itll cover the missions the perils life in space so shall we start with a tour
ive got some work to do
youre not on duty
gannet
okay so maybe i wasnt assigned the story maybe i suggested the idea to my editor
he know how you feel about space exploration that its the last vestige of colonial impulse
i only said that to keep you from signing onto this mission
find another story to do
its too late its due a week from today
then youre going to have to find another source for your information
why are you avoiding me
can you give me one reason why i shouldnt avoid you
we both called it off it was a mutual decision
and it looks like youve changed your mind
i havent decided yet
thats the first honest thing youve said
so reward me by giving me that tour
got a minute
certainly
this baby can you tell if its a boy or a girl
its a girl
a girl is it okay i mean its part human and part vulcan
vulcan and human physiology are not all that dissimilar from the evidence i have theres no reason to believe shes anything but perfectly healthy
thats good to hear
youll also be interested to know she has your eyes and tpols ears
i still cant believe it
im in something of a quandary about it myself especially since tpols never been pregnant
she could have gotten pregnant and not told me about it
and she had the embryo removed also without your knowledge i believe you know the answer to that theory commander
yeah i guess i do
well get to the bottom of this soon enough until then i suggest you keep any such theories to yourself
thats good advice you know my father always wanted a granddaughter he bugged my sister about it constantly
it seems he got his wish
yeah
in the shadow of this incalculable devastation we find ourselves facing a colossal challenge theres an entire world to rebuild not only our cities and homes but mankind itself now is not the time not the time for timidity and second guessing we cannot afford to doubt ourselves
the third world war had just ended and the ceasefire was barely three years old
unless we act decisively we will pass on the scars of mutation and decay to future generations
colonel green
colonel green one of many men history has misunderstood
for the sake of our children and our childrens children we must reject the impure and cast it out
before my father died and left me in this facility i was studying to be a historian until i had a very verbal confrontation with a certain professor who claimed that green was nothing more than a genocidal madman
sounds like we had the same professor
green euthanised hundreds of thousands who were afflicted with radiation damage their millions of descendants wouldve endured horrible disease yet history history never says anything about that suffering that greene prevented
guess it all depends on who writes the history
makes me wonder if ill be remembered with any more accuracy
i dont think youre going to be misunderstood
really sometimes im not certain i understand myself
we did what we had to do not what we wanted to do
im sure greene told himself the same thing
he was right and so are we
daniel you are a wise man
medical report on the patient her symptoms are gone shes one hundred percent
thats wonderful wonderful thank you
that was some serious flying trying to keep the warp fields aligned columbia was fifty metres above us one wrong move and we wouldve lost commander tucker
how did you keep your cool
when i was studying to be a pilot i memorised something chuck yeager said i never let myself be afraid i just focus on the dials and concentrate on flying
that simple huh
most of the time simple works best
these are the shuttlepods
which one did you use to penetrate the sphere in the expanse
shuttlepod one do you want to see inside
if its okay
beautiful little ship
i always thought so unfortunately we use the shuttlepods less and less
why
were getting more comfortable with the transporter
makes sense gets you there in a few seconds
yeah but theres no skill involved
nothing to fly
ive always had a tendency to get attached to machines its crazy but every time we use the transporter i feel were kind of turning our backs on these guys
you cant make a choice without leaving something behind
when i saw you at that conference i started thinking about things decisions ive made
is it my imagination or are you actually opening up to me
dont do that
what
whenever things get a little serious you always turn it into a joke
its a bad habit i have a lot of those
heres another one when im attracted to someone i cant hide it for long
you and your bad habits
the autopsy data confirms what we already knew susan khouri was killed by phasepistol fire
the case file contains very little else in the way of evidence some biographical data on khouri most of its out of date
they dont even know where shed been living for the past year its like she dropped off the face of the earth
that may be exactly what happened
you know something
her blood had elevated levels of growth hormone i ran some more tests and found traces of myofibrilin
thats what they prescribe for extended zerog missions its hardly used anymore outside of military exercises not since the invention of artificial gravity
it is still given to workers in remote places where artificial gravity isnt practical
like mining colonies
the nearest one is orpheus on the moon
i have heard that the moon is a hotbed of terra prime activity you know i think travis has a friend who worked on orpheus he might be able to get a couple of us inside we could pay a little visit undercover
i want to be a part of that visit
id like to volunteer as well
tell travis to see what he can do
yes sir
this is the second time weve been through here weve seen all this before
we still have twenty minutes before we have to report to the foreman
maybe you downloaded an outdated map
the map is correct
maybe youre reading it wrong
we could ask for directions
give me that
i think i know what the problem is
what
were lost lets try that direction
any particular reason
its the only tunnel i dont recognise
trip
i think were getting there
i know youre not convinced ive told you the truth about the child
what do you mean
you think i might have gotten pregnant without your knowledge
i never said that
i know
you been talking to phlox
no have you
look its because youre vulcan isnt it that you know all this
i believe so
i am sick and tired of this bond weve got
i dont particularly enjoy it either
listen for the last time and for the record i do believe you and if you get anymore feelings what
there it is come on lets go
im glad we finally left the shuttlepod
i thought you liked shuttlepods
i like flying them
sure felt like we were flying i have a rule if im in bed with someone they have to be in bed with me
what was that
you are not here
im just worried about some friends of mine
want to talk about it
im under orders not to talk about it
thats the last thing you should tell a reporter
lets change the subject how come you havent settled down
im never going to settle down it doesnt mean im not going to get serious with someone if the right circumstance comes along
and what constitutes the right circumstance
ill know it when it happens what did you mean earlier about reconsidering some decisions youve made
ive spent my whole life in space going from one place to the next seeing you i was wondering maybe the next challenge at least for me is to stay in one place for a while
hoshi
hmm
no word yet from trip or tpol
is there anything i can help with
six of the universal translators started confusing rigelian with andorian theres a glitch somewhere but i cant find it
carry on
fresh off the boat one of the sk models they only give them to grubbers
i guess you found me out
josiah
turner
what brings you to this dump site
change of scenery
yeah thats what i was after too only it wasnt the landscape i got sick of at least there arent as many of them up here seems like everywhere you go humans are getting to be an endangered species
know what you mean
bad enough you cant walk down the street without some freak show scaring the hell out of your kids now the governments making treaties with them
sometimes i wonder where its all going to end
its going to end with human beings becoming secondclass citizens on their own world
someones got to make a stand
yeah thats how i feel too some of us are meeting tonight at twenty two hundred level seven junction four i think youll like what we have to say
ill try and make it
ill look for you
ive learned something
one of the locals isnt very fond of vulcans you were saying
a doctor from one of the medical facilities was found dead yesterday they think it was a cavein
youre not buying it
he worked at the same clinic as susan khouri
i think we each know what were doing tonight
seven million people wiped out by aliens did the xindi even apologise
no
did our government ever demand an apology
no
and where are the reparations for the families of those seven million and now those same leaders want to form a coalition with tellarites andorians rigelians coridanites and vulcans vulcans who not too long ago massacred forty five humans working at the earth embassy nathan samuels claims that future generations will look back on this era with pride but if things keep going the way theyre going there wont be any future generations at least not human i love humanity too much to sit by and let that happen
its estimated that there are at least five thousand unregistered aliens on earth now another study puts that figure at ten thousand this insanity is the direct result of our governments policy and the enforcers of that policy starfleet we need to send a message to the people in power and theres someone here tonight who is going to help us do just that commander tucker of the starship enterprise
all that stuff i said about leaving the ship
of course its off the record while youre on duty you mind if i stay here and work a bit
i need to speak to gannet
something wrong
come with us
where
whats going on
shes not here to do a story on enterprise travis
shes a spy for terra prime
are you all right
i think so
what did you do to her
hey hey
not nearly enough
its not worth it romeo juliets in good hands the two starcrossed lovers i cant help but wonder whether your little drama will end happier than that famous double suicide in a medieval tomb
who the hell are you
john frederick paxton i run this facility
not for long
youre right there commander my mining business is about to take a turn for the worse daniel get started
youre behind this
behind this no i lead this and proudly too before you ask your child is safe and sound finally sleeping through the night i forgot how much trouble a newborn can be
i want to see her
no and no is a word that starfleet better get used to hearing from now on because up until today its always been yes hasnt it yes yes go right ahead roam the stars yes inform potentially hostile species of the whereabouts of earth yes entrust the entire future of our world to nonhuman creatures who dont even feel like we do yes promote the total degradation of mankind by encouraging alienhuman relations well yes is a word that ends here and now im returning earth to its rightful owners i am giving earth back to humanity back to human beings it is my lifes work it is what i was born to do and there is no one not an alien not a human that will stop me from achieving it
my father designed this facility he knew that mining was an unpredictable business mines tap out veins dry up
everyones aboard sir
go to launch mode daniel youre an engineer i think youll appreciate this take a good long look
where are we going
for you thisll be like a walk across the street lock it up
you better hang onto something she gets a little rusty out of the gate
you reconfigured your universal translator to record messages from all the other translators you were spying on the delegates
you accidentally triggered an id protocol in the network i tracked it back to the source
i dont know what youre talking about
you sure know what everyone else was talking about
maybe she was after a story it doesnt mean she worked for terra prime
we did a background check in the last month you made three trips to the lunar colony
is that a crime
depends on what youre doing there
i was on assignment
for
my news agency
your editor claims he never sent you
look if im under arrest then
two of my crewmen are at orpheus mining complex weve lost contact with them
i dont know anything about your crewmen
are they in danger
i want to speak with counsel now
take her to the brig get her whoever she wants
bridge to captain archer
im sorry travis archer
a large vessel is taking off from the mining facility
can you identify it
sir sensors indicate it is the mining facility
were being hailed its starfleet command
ignore them reactor status
ready
youre going to warp
a five second burst
inside the system
well be lucky if we dont fly apart
i plan on luck go
ten seconds
hail them pursuit course travis
aye
no response sir
tell starfleet command were going after them
were in mars orbit all systems functioning
that was a magnificent piece of flying daniel
thats yet to come
impress me again
taking us down
lets see it
slowing our descent
tie us in
its ours
lets take in the view
this is where it all begins josiah
theyre on the surface
where
theyve landed near the verteron array its used to redirect comets
theyre sending a subspace message on all frequencies
my name is john frederick paxton ive just taken over the verteron array on mars i can now fire on any ship or facility in the system
hes targeted earths moon
i have no intention of using this weapon again provided that every single nonhuman in our system leaves immediately a new era is at hand an era that will expose the concept of interspecies unity as an absolute and vicious lie an era that will witness the advent of a humancentred consciousness
that will place our world before all others as of this moment mankind casts off the shackles of alien interference and now determines its own fate
terra prime forever
do not be deceived this is no ordinary innocent child this is an alienhuman hybrid living proof of what will happen if we allow ourselves to be submerged in an interstellar coalition our genetic heritage
i want that transmission blocked
were trying we cant break through the signal
then find some way to contact enterprise i want to speak to archer
terra prime is dedicated to the protection of life in all of its diversity so for the next twenty four hours we guarantee safe passage to all aliens leaving our solar system so long as nonhumans keep to their own worlds
scan paxtons ship for vulcan biosigns get a transporter lock on the baby and tpol
but if any alien if one single alien remains after the deadline terra prime will defend the sovereignty of every single human being
and we will begin by destroying the institution whose blind arrogance and moral cowardice have put us all at risk starfleet command we do not seek war but if the aliens do not leave and force us to fight i make this solemn promise to all of the sons and daughters of earth our future will be secure because humanity will prevail
hes targeted us with the array apparently they dont like being scanned
get us out of here
damage
massive power surge weve lost half our relays the beam was only two percent of the arrays total output he could have vaporised us
well consider ourselves warned set a course to earth
if youll excuse me
of course
ambassador
spontaneous demonstrations have already begun around the vulcan compound
isolated incidents im sure
there are protesters chanting outside the andorian embassy and theyre using words that arent in the universal translator
its obvious paxtons ultimatum is part of a coordinated plan
why are we all still here we could be obliterated at any second
paxtons a fanatic but hes a man of his word he wont act before his deadlines up
the deadline aside the fact that paxton has the support of so many of your people is almost as troubling
i agree earthmen talk about uniting worlds but your own planet is deeply divided perhaps youre not quite ready to host this conference
paxtons holding two of my officers hostage at the array we cant attack it
the councils aware of that if you cant bring yourself to fire on them another captain can be assigned to enterprise no one will think less of you
its not just the hostages any attack on the array will trigger a massive explosion that could kill thousands of colonists
this wasnt an easy decision for the council the potential for disasters even greater than you think over the next thirty months the terraforming project has fourteen comets set to collide with mars without the array to divert them toward the polar caps the comets could hit anywhere even the domed cities
ill take in a small team well break into the facility and stop them
paxton can destroy any ship that approaches mars
if he cant see us he cant destroy us
its unharmed just as i said
her medical readings appear normal
theres nothing normal about it
shes not an it
how did you obtain our genetic material the child is a binary clone
theyd need cells from both of us
the medical freezers on your ship hold biosamples from your entire crew terra prime has supporters everywhere
someone on enterprise helped you who
ive let you see your daughter thats my half of the bargain now its your turn
i need to make modifications on my ship
im listening
i need you to refine my targeting system
you really think im going to help you turn that array into a weapon
you really think im going to give you a choice
two meetings in the span of a week people might start to talk
i dont like it any more than you do
so you want to go to mars and you need my help
you know the situation
i believe im aware of the broad strokes i also understand paxtons tapped into the planetary sensor grid no one can get within a thousand kilometres of the verteron array without being detected
and youre going to tell me how
what makes you think i even have that information
because your section routinely thinks about the unthinkable and because youd never miss a chance to put me in your debt
youre a good judge of character the grid was designed to function in the planets original atmosphere but terraformings made the air much thicker
how does that help us
sections of the grid continually need recalibration and are prone to false signals you can exploit that weakness the good news is with terraforming theres no more need for pressure suits in the lowland oxygen yes thermal garments
according to this if we keep our altitude less than ten metres above the surface paxton wont see us
youll still need to reach the surface undetected
that parts taken care of without your help
so the student has surpassed the teacher when youre finished with mars why dont you come work for me
ive got quite enough to keep me busy on enterprise
and if archers coalition is formed enterprise could be busier than ever
indeed well then i imagine thisll be the last time we meet
always the optimist good luck malcolm
comet burke deflected by the array eight years ago set to hit the north pole of mars at dawn
youre not serious
i have experience with comets sir
compared to penetrating xindi defenses thisll be a walk in the park
but thats only fourteen hours from now what happens if this plan of yours doesnt work
enterprise will destroy the array as ordered
all the rocking in the world will not make that child vulcan or human
human and vulcan genes produced this child which indicates our two species have more similarities than differences
dont you realise that baby is  that baby is as much a threat to your species as it is to mine
shes not a threat
that child is a crossbreed freak how many generations before our genome is so diluted that the word human is nothing more than a footnote in some medical text the same thing could happen to your people or dont you care about that
neither of our species is what it was a million years ago nor what itll become in the future life is change
change in this case means extinction and i for one will not let that baby bring humanity to that point
i wont let you hurt her
i wont have to
what does that mean
were within range
bridge to engineering
kelby here
were coming up on the comet
im on it sir this is it people cycle the ports ensign rig the intakes for cometary debris
yes sir
engineering is good to go sir
youve got full impulse and warp standing by
all right travis lets hitch a ride to mars
aye aye sir
thank you for seeing me
whats so urgent
i never got my lawyer
youll have to talk to the captain
apparently hes busy
we all are thats it
i dont work for terra prime i work for starfleet intelligence
thats not possible
you are not the only one who wants to serve his people
if you were an si agent youd be out of this brig with one call to your division head
and then everyone on enterprise would know who i am including the real terra prime operative
mayweather go ahead
were ready for you in the launch bay
on my way you know im going to tell the captain about this
he wont believe you
probably not why are you telling me this now
youre going after paxton if someone on enterprise is working for him he could know youre coming
so youre revealing all of this because youre worried about me
yes
im touched
travis wait
youre not going to manipulate me again goodbye
keep the sensors locked on the array the moment it powers up
i wont hesitate sir
i remember when you used to jump every time the engines hiccupped
i still do im just better at hiding it
captain
dont get too used to that chair im going to want it back
understood
you know i never used to like vulcans all that much myself they always seemed so smug making us jump through hoops for every little advance in warp technology and they knew the answers all along so what was it with you the ears the fact that theyre vegetarian
theyre not human
well you cant deny that
and they sat by while millions of our people died world war three
we didnt make contact with the vulcans until ten years after the war
but they were up there with their superior technology they couldve stopped it but they didnt i think it suited their plans a devastated earth was much easier for them to control
is that the kind of paranoid crap paxtons been feeding you
get back to work
you ever actually met a vulcan
your friend shes the first
if you got to know some actually took the time to talk with one
you obviously did more than talk and look at what you got for your trouble some halfhuman thing
go ahead
okay
youre a traitor a traitor to humanity
hull platings steady at ninety four percent
whats wrong with the inertial dampeners
we need to maintain an erratic flight profile so we look like a chunk of the comet
thirty minutes to the atmosphere
im taking us closer to the nucleus its going to start getting a little rough
start
would you like me to give you something
ive already had the maximum dosage
heres a bag
no
theres nothing aliens like better than to see us fighting one another
wherere tpol and the baby
theyre together youll eat as soon as you finish your work
i am finished
all youve done is try to sabotage the targeting system
i dont know what youre talking about
please ive been monitoring your work from the control centre to be honest id have been disappointed if you hadnt tried to sabotage the array but you did which proves youre a man of principle that is why i know youre going to refine the array just as you promised
i told you id make modifications to your ship not your weapon
in two hours i am going to fire a verteron beam directly at starfleet command now with this targeting system the way it is i will hit starfleet but ill also take out half of san francisco along with it i need a scalpel not a bludgeon
i dont care what you need
starfleets been warned if thats what concerns you now you can either help me and a few empty buildings will be destroyed or you refuse me and millions may die
you told starfleet when youre planning to fire the array and you dont think theyre going to blast this facility off the face of the planet
if you are so eager for a bloodbath a bloodbath is what you will get put him in detention and make sure he has a news screen i want him to see the bodies when they start to pull them from the rubble
hello im your mother youre going to need a name we should discuss that with your father
the gravitys starting to tear the comet apart
were picking up ionisation from the upper atmosphere
what was that
the engine shut down but there were no warning lights the consoles locked up
hull platings offline hull temperature climbing were coming in too hot
bypassing auto flight control switching to manual
at this speed
were out of options
ground proximity
five seconds to impact
well that was fun can we do it again
a mark three interlock
the closer we get the more we risk being spotted by paxtons sensors
get close to that ridge line
i was thinking the same thing youll want to keep your arms inside the vehicle at all times
thirtytwo
hmm
this is the thirty second planet ive set foot on
two hundred and forty eight
the verteron array is on the other side of that rise well head through there
im told you have something to say to me
in private
i keep no secrets from my men
you and i both know thats not true
josiah give us the room
ill be outside
my daughters ill you will arrange for medical care at once
no one leaves this facility
you will provide immediate transport for my child commander tucker and myself the hospital at utopia colony will be suitable until enterprise arrives
what have you been inhaling the atmosphere what makes you think you can dictate terms to me
this
taggarts syndrome since you obviously didnt die by age twenty youre receiving treatment rigelian gene therapy
youre not a doctor
the very thing youre warning humans to avoid is whats keeping you alive alien knowledge freely shared youre not only a terrorist youre a hypocrite
this is not the time for timidity and second guessing we cannot afford to doubt ourselves
colonel green also said to be human is to be pure under his rule you would have been euthanised for having a genetic disorder
im not the first significant leader who failed to measure up to his own ideal
youre not significant
history will determine that so go ahead tell my followers what you wish see if they take the word of an alien over mine whats wrong with your child
elevated whiteblood cell count lowgrade fever
well its two halves are warring with one another alien and human conflict was inevitable
josiah
your child and the coalition of planets both doomed from the beginning
ten metres
paxtons deadline is up we have to face an unpleasant reality captain archers missions failed
paxton will need two minutes to power up the array before he can fire
two minutes
its enough
im not prepared to take that chance your estimates could be wrong
i wont destroy the array unless we have no other choice
i understand your reluctance
im following orders
im giving you new orders do it now
im sorry sir
i can have you relieved of duty
actually i can only be relieved by a higher ranking officer in my chain of command
open a channel to admiral gardner
belay that order i wont risk exposing our position by breaking radio silence
youre risking the lives of hundreds of thousands of people
i know what im doing
the guards still walking away
theres another guard approaching
took you long enough
wheres tpol
crew quarters but paxtons getting ready to fire the array
if he powers it up
enterprise has orders to destroy the complex
ive spoken to our operatives theres no indication that the vulcans have withdrawn from their consulates in canberra or berlin
i never expected them to comply lets get this done
im picking up a power surge in the array
youre out of time destroy the complex now
take us in full impulse charge weapons
josiah begin the firing sequence
target locked
give the order
coordinates locked in
two minutes to pulse activation
step away from the controls
jonathan archer the man who delivered us from the xindi well look at you now
archer to enterprise
go ahead captain
were inside the control room
standing by
shut it down
main controls are in there
ninety seconds to pulse activation
the rooms depressurising get malcolm out of here go
plasma grid control panel
i know the reason you turned your back on humanity i blame your father he wanted the secrets of warp technology so badly he allowed the vulcans to turn him into their pet human and you well the sins of the father
plasma grid offline firing sequence aborted
my father never asked anything from anyone his mining operations transformed the moon from a mere colony into a completely selfsufficient world and that is how we should go to the stars taking the worlds we need and taming them with human hands and human minds and human souls
that mightve worked for the moon but the galaxys a lot more crowded than we thought
thats not our problem
its an opportunity its over paxton
were each his fathers child
ive been a miner all my life you get used to the low oxygen
firing sequence resumed pulse activation in thirty seconds
pulse activation in fifteen seconds ten nine eight
ive locked the sequence you cant stop it from firing ive locked it
four three two one pulse activated
terra prime forever
looks like paxtons aim was off
with a little help from you
maybe a little
commander
shes dying
i guess we shouldnt keep calling her she
elizabeth
my sister wouldve liked that
it appears my initial prognosis was incorrect its genetic her vulcan and human dna arent compatible
is there anything you can do
im attempting to stabilise her nucleotides but theres never been a child like her
her name is elizabeth
i cant figure out why the console locked up at the same time the engines shut down
it does seem a bit coincidental
flight control and engine power are routed separately until they reach that junction the panels open if ionised gas got in here it couldve melted the primary circuits of both systems
it couldve been knocked loose by an impact
no its been forced this was deliberate
come in
on your feet sir shuttlepod one was sabotaged
sabotaged
we nearly crashed
is this your signature
yeah you think i had something to do with it
is there any reason why we shouldnt
thats a shuttlepod maintenance log commander tucker took me off that team when he came back from columbia
who replaced you who
ensign masaro
they really want to postpone the conference
postpone is a diplomatic way of saying its dead paxtons unnerved them and theres not a lot ive been able to say to change their minds
excuse me sir sato go ahead
its archer are you still with samuels
were in the mess hall
is ensign masaro there
no i dont see him sir
we think masaro may be working for terra prime
samuels may be in danger
reed and mayweather are on their way
wait here sir
samuels is in here hes safe
captain
you dont want to do this
i have to
give me the phase pistol thats an order
i cant sir
ensign
i wanted you to know im sorry i believed in what we were doing tell my parents im sorry i never wanted anyone to get hurt
ensign
i wish i could do more
i know
when you invited me to join this crew i thought it would be an interesting diversion for a few months some time away from the complications of family which on denobula can be extremely complicated i didnt expect to gain another family  it hurts as if she were my own child make something good come from this captain
fellow delegates this last week weve seen what humans can be at their worst but we cannot we must not use that as an excuse to end the dream that began here for then the demons of our past will have won instead i want to look to the future and begin by honouring the people responsible for our being here tonight they represent all of us at our best
up until about a hundred years ago there was one question that burned in every human that made us study the stars and dream of traveling to them are we alone our generation is privileged to know the answer to that question we are all explorers driven to know whats over the horizon whats beyond our own shores and yet the more ive experienced the more ive learned that no matter how far we travel or how fast we get there the most profound discoveries are not necessarily beyond that next star theyre within us woven into the threads that bind us all of us to each other the final frontier begins in this hall lets explore it together
i hear the conference is back on track
its a first step the captain says its going to take years to work out the details
but itll happen and youre part of the reason why
just doing my job
so was i
i know
if vulcans and andorians can get along youd think we could
a lot of details to work out
isnt that the fast way home
the least i can do is give you a ride
the launch bays this way
come in
the delegates at the conference theyve asked about the service for for elizabeth they want to attend
she was important
theres something else i spoke with phlox it turns out there was a flaw in the technique that paxtons doctors used in the cloning process human dna and vulcan dna phlox says theres no medical reason why they cant combine so if a vulcan and a human ever decided to have a child itd probably be okay and thats sort of comforting
when are they expecting you in brazil
i told them a couple of weeks after the ceremony with all the receptions and then ill need at least a week to clear up the linguistic database
after ten years on this ship ill bet itll take a while getting used to the humidity again
and the bugs
does the captain have to give a speech
hes working on it now
he hates giving speeches
and hell undoubtedly make every effort to take no credit
undoubtedly
thatd be like zefram cochrane not taking credit for warp drive
how do you pronounce the name of the second tellarite liberator challash
shallash
shallash thanks
hows it going sir
whatever i write it sounds like im trying to take credit for this
captain admiral douglas is asking you to approve the decommission protocols
one thing at a time after the charters signed ill give him whatever he needs to put enterprise in mothballs
all senior staff report to the bridge
computer freeze programme
save from this time index
programme saved
end programme
first officers personal log  stardate 474571 with the unexpected arrival of admiral pressman my old co i find myself in an awkward position counsellor troi has suggested i might get a few insights by calling up an historic holoprogramme
youre sure you dont want to talk about what happened
ive told you everything i can
if its a question of breaking a promise
not a promise an order
have you learned anything on the holodeck about breaking orders
not yet ive gone back a couple of days earlier to get a perspective but i really dont see how this is going to help
thats why you run a starship and im a counsellor
reeds shorter than i thought hed be
maybe the programmes off
no im sure its fine its just you expect larger than life people to be larger than life
has the andorian hailed them
not yet
you might want to leap ahead to that point its where things start really happening and you should consider taking over the galley
why
well starfleet ships didnt have counsellors in those days but the chef on the first enterprise came pretty close i read almost everybody confided in him
ill keep that in mind
supper
you bet ill give you an update
okay
thats impossible shrans been dead for what three years
this is quite a surprise
 im sorry pinkskin but it was essential certain people believed i had met my demise
including me
i know its been a while but as i recall you still owe me a favour
i remember but this isnt a good time shran i assume you know where were heading
i may no longer be a member of the imperial guard but im aware of the proposed coalition
its more than a proposal were on our way to earth to sign the charter
the ceremony isnt for three days if my plan works youll be home in plenty of time
im afraid a detour is out of the question right now
my childs been abducted kidnapped you owe me
you never told me you had a child
jhamel gave birth five years ago a daughter theyve taken her
who
former associates its a long story you need to let me come aboard
set a rendezvous course
computer freeze programme advance ahead one hour switch to objective mode
who wouldve thought civilian life would be more dangerous than commanding a ship for the imperial guard
i still dont understand why you left you were a hero
a hero with a family i always believed that change was a good thing i was a fool
why would you fake your own death
i made some poor choices picked the wrong friends people involved in questionable business ventures they think i took something that belonged to them with the help of some old colleagues from the guard i managed to make myself disappear it worked for nearly three years
your friends found you
six months ago ive been on the move ever since they took her in the middle of the night i was in the next room asleep useless its been a week they say if i dont return whats theirs theyll kill her
then give them what they want
i dont have it i never did
but you have a plan
it cost me everything i had but i managed to find out where theyve taken her theyre on a trading outpost rigel ten
im familiar with it
i know these men quite well captain i can outwit them ive done it before but ill need at least seven men you have to help me its my little girl
hes an admitted criminal you said so yourself
he said he fell in with some disreputable people that doesnt make him a criminal
if were late for the ceremony it will have farreaching consequences
if shran hadnt helped us i never wouldve gotten aboard the xindi weapon have you forgotten that this alliance is based on friendship and loyalty exactly what shran is looking for right now
i dont trust him
you dont trust andorians you never have thank god the vulcan council is a little more enlightened than you are if theyre willing to forge an alliance with andoria the least you can do is give shran the benefit of the doubt when we met ten years ago i didnt trust you for that matter i didnt trust any vulcans you helped me get past that remember i listened to you now its your turn to listen to me i cant turn my back on him tpol try to understand
ill try
by the way drop by the galley when you get a moment chefs trying to come up with a menu for our last dinner together he wants to know everybodys favourite dish
there are eighty three crewmembers aboard
just go see him all right
dont worry chefs promised at least six kinds of cheese
i appreciate the gesture but its not necessary to prepare a special dish for me
come on ive already started to reduce the plomeek broth all i need to know is which roots you prefer
in that case i prefer to be surprised
pull up a chair i could use the company i heard a rumour i may be whipping up some andorian cabbage soup tonight
we have already lost five hours picking up shrans shuttle now were going to lose at least another day diverting our course to rigel
his childs in danger
is there anything aboard this ship you dont know
jonathan is a compassionate man you should know that by now
his compassion has gotten us into trouble on many occasions we could miss this ceremony
dont worry ive got a hunch youre going to make it tea
thank you
phlox has giving me his largest edosian suckerfish
excuse me
looks like a catfish im hoping it tastes like one commander tuckers crazy for catfish do you ever miss him
i spent the morning with him recalibrating the plasma array
thats not what i mean
if youre referring to our intimate relationship thats been over for six years
but the question remains do you miss him
im vulcan i dont miss people
sorry i forgot is he as concerned as you are about making this ceremony
trip rarely questions the captains decisions
he doesnt strike me as someone who follows orders blindly
hes not he simply tends to agree with the captain most of the time he trusts him
would you peel these for me
before i joined this crew i never could have imagined anything more important than following orders
and now
humans believe that sometimes you have to follow your instincts a very illogical approach but one ive come to embrace
computer freeze programme thanks
there you are  someone you know
someone i knew
pegasus
phil wallace hell of a handball player pressman was getting ready to promote him
how many died
seventy one all but nine of us
how do you feel about learning the ship wasnt destroyed
what difference does it make seventy one people died
youre feeling guilty you think in some way you were responsible
youre the empath why dont you tell me
i think its something else something about seeing that ship again
why dont we change the subject okay
okay how did things go on the holodeck
they picked up the andorian theyre on their way to rigel ten
i was referring to any insight you may have gained
i took your advice about the chef you were right tpol opened up to me
have you met with commander tucker
no i havent made it to engineering yet have you spent any time on the nx01
ive never run the programme
what about the ship itself
i think i went when i was a little girl but i get all those museum ships mixed up
nows your chance come on down with me
i have an appointment in an hour
ill get you back in plenty of time come on
our brig is bigger than this
a lot of things change in two hundred years
watch yourself
no fish tank
how could archer survive without a fish tank
allow me
he does have a dog though
right i remember one of the musketeers
porthos
ooh comfy
no seat for the first officer
perhaps archer wasnt as fussy as captain picard when it came to people sitting in his chair
i remember seeing one of these in a photograph
kirks ship had them i think
engineerings down this way
theres something lonely about a ship without its crew
computer add an appropriate crew complement objective mode
thats better
if you recall rigel ten is filled with a very unsavoury element and i rather doubt shrans scheme will be quite as simple as he claims
i cant imagine the captain would put us in jeopardy this close to signing the charter
i dont like it what exactly are you doing
these injectors need to be purged every six months are the deuterium filters clear
weve done all but three
make it quick
aye sir
well whats the point this ship will be joining the mothball fleet next week
i pretty much built this engine plan to take care of it as long as i can been a hell of a run malcolm never thought it would come to an end
all good things captain thinks therell be another enterprise before too long
i imagine
it wont be the same
thats okay come on
its sad commander tucker had no idea he wouldnt make it back
how reliable are your sources
theyre criminals but honourable ones they promised me that tallas being held here at upper level four have you fashioned the amethyst
the photograph you gave us had poor resolution but im confident our replication will look authentic
the tenebian amethyst they think i stole was flawless theyll undoubtedly have magnifying equipment with them
theyll need a spectral micrometer to see its a fabrication
how many do you expect to show up
computer freeze programme
hes cute
dont get any ideas
regll be furious if im late are you going to stay
yeah for a little while
good luck computer arch
computer how long before they reach rigel ten
sixteen hours twenty two minutes
advance to that point stay in objective mode
move into a stationary orbit
aye sir
put a team together meet us in the launch bay
captain can i have a word with you
we can handle this without you
well thats flattering
you know what i mean youve got the biggest day of your life coming up a lot of people are counting on you being there
i appreciate you worrying about me but ill be fine
you dont need to be putting yourself in harms way im telling you we can take care of it
rigel was the first place we visited remember now its going to be the last poetic justice why should you have all the fun
were going through the troposphere might get a little bumpy
have you been down to see chef yet
first thing this morning you
he talked about you
me
us
what about us
its not important
whyd you bring it up then
do you ever miss me
you mean
yes
you know how long its been
thats not what i asked you
well yeah i guess sometimes
i havent thought about those days in a long time
benefit of being a vulcan
after speaking with chef i realised we may never see each other again
what are you talking about
were taking different assignments theres no way of knowing
theres every way of knowing i can guarantee you were not going to lose touch stop thinking like that
however long it may be i believe im going to miss you
archer to shuttlepod two
go ahead sir
shrans made contact everythings set ill lead you in
understood
stop there unless im mistaken i thought you had no idea where the amethyst was
wheres my daughter
funny how a missing child has a way to jog the memory eh shran
where is she
i thought you were happily married whos the vulcan
im not interested in your associates so dont question mine
put the case down and open it
we want the child first
i could shoot you both
youll never get this case open i promise you
you let a female negotiate for you eh shran
you heard her
are you all right
im hungry
now open the case
set it down now back up
let her take the girl
fine but you stay one step and this little blue beauty wont have a father to come home to
i want you to go with tpol youll be safe with her shell find you something to eat obey your father
now step back
what are you doing
stand still and you wont be harmed
hold on
thanks boss
any time
youre certain it wont be a problem
ill feel more comfortable getting you away from your friends at warp four
my shuttle may be slow but their ships can barely make warp two
all the same youll be under your own power by tomorrow night well contact your wife and tell her to expect you the next morning
i told you my plan would only take a few hours
youre welcome you should let phlox take a look at her before you go to your quarters
whatever you say captain
thanks pinkskin
you must be getting tired of saving my life
im glad i didnt take your advice about not coming along
yeah you and me both then again you almost got yourself killed down there wouldnt have gone over too big at the ceremony
signing documents are easy training a new engineer that can be a real pain in the ass
data to counsellor troi
yes data
i was wondering if this might be an appropriate time to continue our discussion on the longterm effects of space travel on my positronic net
can i give you a rain check
you may check me for rain if you like counsellor but i assure you there is no water in my
data ill get back to you come in
i know its past office hours
what is it
it wont be long before they find the pegasus
you havent made your decision the holodeck
they rescued the andorians daughter
so youre coming to the moment of truth in there as well
i need you to promise youll keep this confidential
you know i will
what do you know about the treaty of algeron
2311 it redefined the romulan neutral zone
it also outlawed the use of cloaking technology on starfleet vessels
the pegasus
a secret group in starfleet security developed a prototype pressman was put in charge of testing it
thats why theyre so eager to find it before the romulans do
the accident the seventy one people who died we were testing the cloaking device
it was covered up
the nine of us who made it back alive were sworn to secrecy
and youve lived with that for twelve years
they want to pick the experiment up where they left off
are you sure
pressman told me himself what theyre doing is wrong it could jeopardise the treaty
and you want to tell that to captain picard
i took an oath of secrecy pressman still outranks the captain
will you didnt get this far in your career making easy decisions im confident youll make the right one now
i wish i was
he was anything but tactful what his countrymen might refer to as a hick for the life of me i couldnt understand what captain archer saw in him
thinner roll it a little bit thinner like this
yeah right
go on
thats about it really i used to think that first impressions meant something i guess its not always true to be honest i didnt think he was going to last a month old friend of the captains or not and now i cant imagine what these last ten years wouldve been like without him
did you ever find yourself attracted to him
maybe a little i never really thought he was my type didnt even graduate college he learned about engineering working on boat engines i think never cared much about languages could barely speak english but he did have his moments i still find him kind of cute keep that to yourself
always do captain said theyd known each other a long time
close to twenty years he taught the captain how to scuba dive somewhere off the coast of florida
youre pressing too hard just slow steady movement
sorry
no need to apologise
theyve got a shorthand they use sometimes comes from spending so much time together
did trip ever take a swing at picard
at who
archer captain archer
not that i know of when push comes to shove commander tucker usually ends up doing the right thing how am i doing
dont let it get too big now fold it over there you go
and hes always pushing himself often to the point of exhaustion hes forced me to order him to relax on more than one occasion
to relax
yeah wasnt very keen on getting neuropressure treatments from tpol but it was that or become addicted to sedatives
if i remember correctly thats when
their romance began precisely one time he became so exhausted i had to demand he get six hours sleep he negotiated it down to four a very stubborn young man
i quite enjoy this
so did he follow your orders
didnt have a choice
youve always got a choice
so do you think this alliance is going to hold
wed better hope so there are thousands of planets within reach got to start somewhere
who would have guessed vulcans and andorians in the same bed
the tellarites were never big fans of the andorians either this is a special bottle of whiskey zefram cochrane gave it to my father the day they broke ground at the warp five complex
and here we are toasting to warp seven
heres to the next generation
written your speech yet
i always crammed before exams ive got three days left
the biggest day of your life and youre going to wait until the night before
its the biggest day of our lives
i hate to contradict you captain youre the man theyre waiting to see
archer to the bridge whats going on
were under attack sir a small vessel
who are they
we dont know yet  intruder alert
weve come for shran and the child
i thought you said their ship couldnt catch up to us
remind me to mention that to shran
youre leaving me very little choice
shran left six hours ago youre too late
youre lying his shuttle is still in your launch bay kill him
hold on wait a minute
ill take care of this
the hell you will ill bring you to shran i know where he is
i gave you an order commander
you heard me i said id bring you to shran
trip
very well turn around both of you
hey this guys the captain
thats enough
hes my boss if im going to disobey his order i dont want him coming along
trip thats enough
listen i wont do this if you kill him but could you please shut him up
stop you cant expect me to just leave him here alive
hes out cold hes not going to cause any trouble
stay here if were not back in ten minutes kill him
didnt you hear what i just said i wont help you if you kill him this might take longer than ten minutes
take me to shran or ill kill him right now
okay okay ive got a better idea ill bring shran to us we dont have to go anywhere
be very careful
you can all come see for yourselves this is just a comm station
im going to need to open this so i can bypass the security protocols is that okay
as long as you keep your hands where we can see them
no problem
now all i need to do is connect this to the relay inside that panel
stop open it for him if theres a weapon in there youre going to die before your captain
satisfied
proceed hurry up youre running out of time
theres just one other thing i need to tell you you can all go straight to hell
trip
hes not responding
add two percent synthosurfactant
doctor
the plasma was superheated it thermalised his lungs initialise the hyperbaric sequencer

for his parents
will they still be coming to the ceremony
i told them i thought trip wouldnt want it any other way dont forget this
id like to meet them
his parents
yes id like to meet them
theyre a little eccentric i think youll see where trip got his sense of humour
my mother was somewhat eccentric as well
i remember
trip told me as the years went by that i would miss her less but he was wrong because i find myself missing her more why would he tell me that
time heals all wounds but absence makes the heart grow fonder i guess its a little tricky emotions have a way of contradicting themselves
and you wonder why we suppress them
when i took command ten years ago i saw myself as an explorer i thought all the risks would be worth it because just beyond the next planet just beyond the next star there would be something magnificent something noble and now trip is dead and i have to give a speech about how worthwhile its all been
trip would be the first to say it was worthwhile
fried catfish with hush puppies
obviously the captain mentioned why i wanted to see you
keep in mind within a week ill be eating the real thing im taking my folks down to mobile
nothing like a challenge
captain asked for meat loaf didnt he
i havent spoken to him yet

theyre not peeled yet
thats okay
you know hed never admit it but this thing means a hell of a lot to him hes real proud to be one of the people signing this charter and he ought to be
you sound like a lifetime member of the jonathan archer fan club
i can count on one hand the number of people i trust i dont mean trust like i trust you arent lying to me or i trust you wont steal my money im talking about the kind of trust where you know someones not going to hurt you no matter what where you know theyll always be there for you no matter how bad things get you ever know anybody like that

you know i havent decided yet you got any advice
nope but im sure youll make the right choice
are you certain these are the right seats
yep
they dont seem very vip to me
im sure the admiral wanted us to have a view that took in the scope of the occasion
from this distance you cant tell an andorian from a tellarite
have you given an answer to captain stillwell yet
ive asked him for a little more time until captain archer decides what hes going to be doing
ill bet you a months pay hell be on the bridge of a new ship he wont be able to resist one of those warp seven beauties
ive heard hes already been tapped for admiral
malcolms right theyll never keep him behind a desk
its very wise of you to stick with him thats exactly what i plan to do
please stand still if you hadnt waited until the last minute you would have had time to memorise your speech
you sound like my ninth grade teacher
there are dignitaries here from eighteen different worlds its a good sign i wouldnt be surprised if this alliance begins to expand before we know it you should be very proud of yourself captain
ill be proud of myself if i get this speech out in one piece
thats not what i meant
i know what you meant phlox and i appreciate it but this is not about me
why do so many humans refuse to take credit where credit is due there are times when modesty and humility are quite illogical
whenever youre ready sir

thank you doctor
youd better get out there you dont want to miss me screwing this thing up
im going to remain down here if you dont mind

oh hell be fine i had to memorise this speech in grammar school you wish you could tell them all that this alliance will give birth to the federation
i think im ready to talk to captain picard i should have done it a long time ago
so i guess were through here
i guess we are computer end programme
space the final frontier these are the voyages of the starship enterprise its continuing mission
to explore strange new worlds to seek out new life and new civilisations
to boldly go where no man has gone before
