"well, you know that thing happened right around the time for cabin relief,"
yes.

"charlie, where is the earth? should be right straight up."
"hello, houston, endeavour. rape98/8"
"that's affirmative, jim."
"yes, that's right. are you sure we want the - yes, that's right; 8-second intervalometer for looking at the nadir with the 80 millimeter. right?"
"thank you, gene."
yes. here. i got it. it's locked.
right. a chip off the bottom and the soil will probably do it.

yes. i figure this is probably the best one of all.
roger. go ahead.
okay. verify tone on and h20 flag at about 1.2 to 1.7.
"yeah, we - -"
okay; thanks.
"very good, and thanks for taking my picture."
and he's opening at 2-1/2; he put in some posigrade velocity to go up and above and come down and get with us.
and nrylocator is - -
"okay, thank you. appreciate that (laughter)."
"no, but we've got the booster and is she pretty. challenger's just sitting in her nest."
we are on our way. want to get a clock countdown there?
all parts of the solar array are clear of the ground now.
"(coughing). 07 07 28 50 _p how's your eye, john?"
"yes, just mapping - it's delete the ""mapping camera/laser altimeter, open,"" and ""mapping camera- extend."" just delete those two functions. you remember it's already out and the cover is staying open because it's out."
that's good. _-_
"engine gimbal, enable. _"
roger.
"okay, you're weak but readable, charlie."
"hank, do you read me at all?"
i understand you'd like to repeat?
it better be a go. i'll check everything again. let's just doublecheck. . . .
"go ahead, orion."
ain't he though.
"rsght, you're filthy, as - fredo says."
"okay, coming up on 3 minutes - 07 07 34 50 _ mark."
"roger that, jim. understand - -"
"no, a little bit more than that."
go. o1 07 01 u5 ct the tv people do not have access to net 1 in that area. suggest we use net 2 for taat pur- pose.

"okay, houston. astro switch 1 is rotated; short- ing amp switch is in. i'll be a happy man if you tell me you're getting a signal."
roger.
huh?
"although most of them - well, at this distance, gordy, the circulation - detailed circulation patterns to say what's a cyclone and what isn't are not visible to the naked eye, at least not to mine."
"starting on frame 4, bob."
"okay, vance. while we're waiting, just for your information, the command module has been stowed per your checklist with the exception of the two hasselblad cameras."
"apollo 13, houston."
eps sensor si(]ll/khmain b closed on panel 5.
"okay, joe. it - our wobble in this ptc has picked up where the moon is running by pretty high in the window and the earth pretty low; so i expect - on the side where the moon's present, w_'r_ havi_lg a little bit of trouble with the comm ... breakout there in a couple of places."
"okay. we want an option 1 and you've got some ball angles for sun and moon. and right now, jim has the sun pretty well squared away right in the middle of aot."
did you get a picture of it?
"okay. and, challenger, you'll be glad to know you are go for depress."

"sounds good, houston. 03 10 10 -- begin lunar rev 4"
"yes, i'll be doing that. bend over, dave."
"#**, this is houston. cdr, we're not reading the"
"and, that is a beauty. and, dave and jim, we've got an answer on your question when you're ready."
"you didn't order one. i think you said something; i remember back there not liking one of them, what was it, ham and potatoes?"
that's why i didn't land up there.
"yes, it's great."
"okay, that was a good readback. ready with doi-2 when you are."
"okay. you know, just for future reference here, if we like to do things in zero g and without jarring or jiggle, we want to make sure that the switch actuates with a minimum of pressure."
"sure is pretty on the ..., too.... 08 o0 58 43 ' cdr yes."
"come on. lock, baby. okay, it's on -"
roger.
"roger. step 9 is a verb 44. step 10: cb 16, eps inverter 2, open. over. 03 00 48 53 i24p okay. i got it."
"okay, we're - how do you read now? we're in a forward omni."
"okay. oh, jack, i could swing it over the - won't be any problem. over the strut. okay; and the jet bag is springing free - swinging free."
"okay, we copy. you're down as far uv, on. now we'd like to have ir cover, open; and uv cover, open, also."
engine gimbal is enable.
"well, i thought we'd whip right over to the rille. i didn't think we'd have this type of terrain."
"okay, surface checklist, page 3-4."
"joe, this is - it's a tan, fine-grained crystalline rock. i've got to say that, because it's got - up to 2-millimeter laths of plage in it randomly or- iented. and the matrix is a sort of light gray to tan. it's a very well - indurated rock. on the outside, i've got nice glass-filled tip, and some other pits in it. it's sure solid and - sure looks crystalline. it's a beauty. it came from this large block over here at 275."
roger.
right here. i'm on it.
roger.
copy that.
did they get a chance to drive the rover around very much? d5 07 58 58 cc ah - yeah. the rover went real well. i think they had - got pretty much everything in on the first eva that they'd planned on.
okay. thank you.
"okay, houston. we think we're down to 117:03 now. what time have you got?"
roger. we found it.
"why don't you keep grabbing a few, and i'm going to - -"
"roger, 13. go ahead."
"okay. thank you, jim. stand by a second; i'll be back with you in a moment here. 05 20 43 26 cdr-i_i and, houston, it was tilted such that we could get the 02 high-pressure line in it at the same time we were doing the water servicing to - to save some time. so you can probably get a picture of the angle of it by considering the plss on the midstep tilted up so the 02 line would reach it."
go ahead.
how you like them? okay?
yes. yes.
"apollo 11, this is houston. over. i'_:::_e'i'1) '[':tl4_',_'/o"
"yes. pitch to 0, 109. okay."
any thoughts about the light-colored annulus around d-caldera.
"okay. before i start into it step by step, let me just say that it's basically - the - the change is basically moving some of the items around in time, and there's not many changes in procedures involved. the one main thing is we're going to ask you to go into - into the lm a little early, i guess, earlier than you had planned. and we're going to also re- quest that you give us enough - you bring enough of the telemetry on line so we look at the - can look at the lm batteries. and there's no particular reason we want to do this today. nothing that we suspect is wrong, but rather, apparently, the sys- tems people are interested in a better granularity in data points that they're taking on these bat- teries. that's the reason for this particular addition. other than that, i think there's no - nothing at all very - very different about this flight plan update, other than a few minor changes. and i'll go ahead and start if you're ready."
yes. let's see - 90 - -
"okay. hey, jim, can you see me out the window? hey, jim?"
"okay. the condensate [?] tank has already been discarded, houston."
"jim is busy drigging - digging trenches there by the im, and he just about dug a hole big enough to - to build a swimming pool in. he did a good job. 06 04 16 lb cc and you see as far south as the carpathian mountains, al?"
"okay, fred. stand by."
"okay. your nay system works off baker and delta, so it should be on baker, all right."
"wheels; they looked good a minute ago. i got the sun, so i can't tell much - -"
"roger. we're watching it for you - - 03 10 25 5_ cdr yes, they're getting it ..."
"oh, okay. hey, challenger. this is sea monster. how do you read? this is america, really (iaugnter)."
"okay, we'll be watching for it."
"yes, i'm sure we will."
okay. okay; coming up - it's 09:25 now. stand by. okay _ ken.
"(laughter) itm coming up to find you, rojo. c5 23 06 44 i242_ it won't; be long."
"at 191:05, may have tc use an arrow to get it in there, ""image motion, increase, barber pole, on."""
"okay, we'll give it a try."
ready to copy.
"jack, i've got to get new bags. i've only got one left, and you don't have any, i don't believe."
"propellant quantity monitor, off. you did that?"
man alive! watch them push.
no.
okay; i'm in the corner.
h-dot's about 20 high.
exactly right.
"okay, casper; this is houston. we're convinced that we want you to fire directly at the lm at about 5 feet per second. we want to get a positive closing rate."
okay. i verify that the battery covers are open. i haven't pulled the circuit breakers yet. i'm going over and dust - i'm dusting the battery covers; they're dirty.
be easier since i'm here.
... - apollo 12.
"okay. sounds like a good idea. on the - your gravimeter questions, the tge numbers for the com- parison i believe you wanted, between the north and the north massif and the sculptured hills, just aren't available. the whole tge team took their data and - and left town, evidently. and - we - we have been unable to come up with any good numbers on that question. the lunar surface gravimeter - okay, break - break here. we need a verb 48 load as shown, and then - -"
roger.
"no, i don't want it there. must have had it in the wrong -"
(humming)
"okay, and, joe, you want us to start a ptc maneu- ver at this time?"
shows you're thinking.
okay.
charlie ...
okay.
you ought to ... the ... off just this side ...
yeah. roger. eecom's just calling it. we're seeing it drop off here now.
304.99. thank you.
okay.
"okay. the second one, at 32 hours looking at bennett's comet - we want the pictures taken when the spacecraft is as stable as it's going to be before starting ptc. the stability requirement is very high. we weren't sure if you understood that from what we passed up. in addition, the photographs might not show as much as the eye can see of the comet, so if you see anything interesting about the structure of the comet, why, sketching it is in order and is encouraged. over."
"16, based on what we're looking at, the system a pressures look okay. we don't see any problem with the tanks."
watch your shadow out there. (eagle)
we used the forward dump valve until about 2 ps_. (tranq) and we're using the overhead now.
"15, go ahead."
"got it, huh?"
that's 4 ... 00 03 07 03 cml° okay. now you can change it.
"right. and one other change we have is, shortly after that, where we're configuring for jettison, we have closed both the forward dump valve and the overhead dump valve. and we don't want to get in a locked up position like that, so one way to get around it is to - after we close the forward dump valve, turn the descent oxygen valve off. over. 05 12 47 ]7 lmi' okay. after the forward dump valve, add a step in that says the descent ox valve, off."
let me have the cable right there.
"okay, jack. copy."
"hold it, babe. we got to do a little detouring."
... back the other way.
"ahhh. that maneuver put us - 00 03 06 56 cml° okay; here goes. l, l, 2, 3, 4."
"houston, how do you read the lmp?"
"okinawa, this is swim 1. i have recovery beacon ' 115 degrees magnetic, at 270_ _7. over.

"okay. 01 09 2_ 48 cmp and, don, i'm holding off on the oxygen heaters. i'm keeping them all three in auto until we get th_ surge and repress tanks built back up. if'that's okay, if you would like for me to _urn the:r,off, i can reconfigure now; otherwise, i would like you to help me remember not to leave them on."
i certainly agree.
awful.
and - -
everything looks okay up here.
roger.
okay. let's take one from right here. i want - i want the whole thing.
"bob, i'm parked at 026; bearing is 226; distance, 6.6; range, 4.0; amp-hours, 85 and 80; battery is i - i think it's ll5; and motors are all off scale low."
roger. that's got it.
"okay, i need another scoop."
"oh, yes. that's not bad. not a bad picture. 0ops!"
"okay, you are locked."
"oh, yes."
infinity minus 1. some such - -
"are you still working on that, al?"
okay.
"roger, gene. it's at 5.3. we're monitoring very closely if you - if it helps you any."
starting - -
"that's fine, buzz. 03 12 35 54 i24p terminate battery charging now."
"just bow's our power consumption, houston, just out of curiosity?"
"yes, sir. we're going to get it warmed up here, though, slot - shortly. okay; america still looks good to us."
okay; cover that - copy that.
okay. thank you.
...
"hello, ron. how's it going up there?"
i believe it was auto. beautiful.
i know it. i know it.
"okay. mode select, landing radar. tape meter, h and h-dot."
"okay, we copy 2 sets of eva gloves to the surface for the last time."
"okay. cabin pressure - emergency cabin pressure valve to both, al."
okay.
"okay. 02 00 26 12 cmld oh, that's great. thank you. hey, don, is our comm gonna be good enough the way we're going here now for you to get the marks or are we gonna - shall we count on recording them on board too?"
"ron, i guess i'm estimating you about 12 or 15 feet."
"it's okay. okay, it's 3 minutes into the burn. we're coming up on tight rules very shortly."
"right after, yes."
"okay. i also see the tank that - package tempera- ture a little higher on that quad too. but, being close to a hundred it seems a little unusual. you're - you're happy, right?"
"okay. thank you, jack. copying that."
"okay, i got it. okay, that looks like our - our old friend, the gabbro, all right."
early?
"yeah, i never - i forgot to raise it."
yes. it is fun. onfidential
"okay, joe. point up, i'll - okay."
"propellant quantity monitor, off."
"hello, houston; america. it looks like we're with you again."
okey-dokey.
and i'd like to - to thank all my friends for that.
... he running?
"- - tomorrow, in deference to the cdrs intimated request anyway, and let the cmp take the next shift where in the flight plan it now calls for the cdr. it was really our mistake on the original change. i guess there's no need to call all those detailed flight plan changes now unless you want to copy them. a reminder also, prior to going to sleep, to bump the cabin up to 5.7 with the ops to start getting the gas out of the ops. and i checked with the remaining two homefronts, jack. your - i talked to your mother and sister. every- body's fine there, and they watched the top of your head a little bit this afternoon on the eva. they're looking forward to seeing you tomorrow on the press conference and back on earth shortly thereafter. i got one from nassau bay, too, if the co_nander's listening."
the ... we're approaching - -
"hey, there you go."
"and the first - the first star angle difference was -you know, you can get a little bit lax about it - if you want to spend a little time at it, you can get five balls every time, looks like."
"okay, my plss water is hooked up."
"yes, i'm on left. i'm on leff. let me go to backup."
"yes, i did, joe."
"hey, that's mighty fine, by gosh."
"okay. i've got that much more. that's the end. you may have it tangled on something, pete."
"looks like - although the blue-grsy up on the hill - looked like a fragment breccia, if this is still related, then it's - been some partial melting at some time."
okay.
"whoops, here we go again. give me a help."
"jim, the people down here would appreciate it if you could give them something of a description of the operation of the pu valve during the loi burn."
"slight vibration, coming along very smooth. 00 02 29 35 c_ okay. 128, on the money. a little low in altitude. confid l"
yes.
"okay. can do, accel command to 1 degree per second."

"by golly, that's just superl it's - you know - unreal."
"mark. white dot, left eye, outboard, center."
okay. ttca 28.
"okay, bob; understand that."
"and, bob, they were all with the lens - yes, sir - they were all with the lens cap off."
doing fine. i'm trying to get around swi° over here and start hitting that -
no. waiting for the time to run out. okay. the pan camera mode barber poled and gone back to gray. that took about 40 seconds.
can you see the landing site? i think it's going to be in the darkness.
okay.
where are you?
"here, you've got to put this uv thing in the window, too."
"stand by 1. we need the lm/cm delta-p for one thing, and i'll check back in a minute with the others."
here. here's what i was gonna- okay. oh. okay. i'm gonna have to - i'm gonna have to get under there to get to those for you.
"... ruin reg a valve, open."
- - out of the way of the lid of a-l?
"okay, houston. we're going on to lm power right now."
"yes, i omitted that, ken; i was going back to that. back over here at minus 20, we want to delete - scratch through ""tape recorder, high bit rate, forward, command reset."" and for your info, the reason we'¥e given this 20 minutes is_ in both tape45/3 loi and doi, that gives us about 10 minutes to watch what you're doing, watch the gimbal drive check, and if you need any help, we can give it to you from down here."
"sure could. i thought i - didn't i call out 13-d, houston? i guess i didn't call it out loud enough. i think it was 13-d. then, let me - i'll check the next one and if you - the next time we stop i'll tell you the next one for sure and then you'll know what it is. ( onftdenti'a[?,"
must not be because i don't know for sure what you mean (chuckle).

on the lm/cm delta-f.
"houston, 16 - on another antenna."
roger.
"i thought it would be a big bang, but it's a slow buildup ..."
... there.
"okay, i gave you a prd about 2 hours ago, and f just to bring you up to date to where it was, and we'll keep them out."
"and if you open the pallet, be careful of the clamp. probably, if it's feasible, we suggest you reach across in front of the pallet - reach across the pallet to do it. instead of opening it because of the clamp on the fender."
"oh, yes. i remember the last time we put it on the central station, the thing collapsed, and then you left it over at the ear."
like a light to the blind. (no communications for l0 minutes)
"okay. first of all, the guys down here would like to send up their warmest congratulations on such an ex - successful eva. you sure made it look easy up there. and the questions. the questions we got are about the mapping camera, and they're directed at the general problem of is there - was there anything you could see which might indicate why it jammed? and there are three - three partic- ular items that you might have looked at. first of all, it was the main camera cover at the bottom of the camera. was it touching or scraping the camera in any way that you noticed? l0 05 44 29 cml° the answer to that is negative. in fact, i checked it. i checked the mapping camera cover, laser altimeter cover quite carefully to make sure, because i do know that there have been some interference problems with that before, particu- larly with the pan camera, so i was looking at that in particular to see that it was maybe ad- justed too close or - or interfering along the side of the pan camera, and it was not. there was about half an inch clearance between the upper edge of the cover and the body of the mapping camera, so that i - i don't see that that was responsible for the thing j_mming."
... pictures. do we just take them from straight down?
huh?
"13, houston. at 11 minutes, you're go. pre- dieted cut-off on the s-ivb is 12 plus 34. over. ,!.["
"okay. at 239:30, the high gain angle -"
sounds like the headset - -
"oh, we got plenty of bags. don't sweat the bags, we got more than we'll ever - even need."
that shouldn't change.
okay. i'll get it when i get up there.
"okay, houston; we got a good sep."
"now - now, i need the tpi time, minus - tpi time."
ain't no way i could tell ...
one more coming at you.
"okay, we're setting on the minus 200-decrease."
"okay. 06 00 33 37 i,mp-eva i'll take the scoop."
"yes, you're right."
yes. it'll tell us something.
"no, they're - they're two - they were all one boulder, i think. they are just two major rock types in the - whatever they came from. and i tried to describe that to you. we have the contact in the central boulder. they're really three big boulders. the central boulder had the contact between the light-gray rocks - or the blue-gray rocks and the vesicular anorthositic gabbro."
"okay. we're stea_ing along here and i just passed kant; and i tell you, these things aren't nearly as dramatic as they were down in that low pass. when you came over the kant plateau down low, it really looked like the ground was coming up. and i'm crossing the crater descartes and that bright area; and, again, that surface of that bright area -' doesn't look nearly as distinct as it did in the low sun. i have the landing site in the binoculars now. i can look down into south ray, and it really is a jumbled thing. i can see one bright layer, then a dark layer, then a bright layer, and then a dark layer on the south - or on the west side. and on the south, it looks like some of the same. and i can't see into the shadows very well to the norvh. i'm looking over at the - well, let's see here. i'm over - around the - i've got double spot in the binoculars; and let's see if i can see anything in that area."
"... take at it - take a look at it again with the - yes, roger. the circuit breaker is out."
roger. tape27/1 apollo 17 air-t0-ground voice transcription
"okay. yeah, houston. we've got the both - plsss recharged with water and the inlet oxygen topoff."
"loop's good. okay, we should ... ecs, and then the fill valve ... on."
okay.
"okay. there is a good strong northern hemisphere cyclone up near india, and i think gene mentioned that. it, i think, was one i saw in some of the forecast sheets as a dissipating hurricane or typhoon. i'm not sure which it is there. i guess it's a typhoon. and i see something here that i noticed in earth orbit, bob. that as you approach the terminator - and now i'm looking at the eastern terminator - have to keep all my directions straight here - yes, eastern terminator. the clouds - those associated with the cyclone over india and one that's - appears to be due south of there - maybe 30 degrees of latitude - have a gray appearance. the - instead of the brilliant white of other clouds as you approach the terminator, those - at least the high level clouds are gray. now, when we were going over them in orbit, the lower level clouds were still white, and i think i can see a hint of that right now. the sun gives a strong light reflection off of the buildups in the low- level clouds; whereas, the high-level and probably layered cirrus and maybe some of the intermediate level stratus tend to look gray because of grazing sun, i suspect."
"yes, sir."
- - about 10 or - 10 percent boulder cover.
"yes, we already did that, gordy. they were a mess, and we took them off. they're in the jettison bag now."
okay. you know that bright spot might already be there; but i don't think so. i don't remember seeing it.
- - and sps breakers.
"endeavour, houston. over."
roger. you want a gca_
right.

"tony, how do you read?"
"no, by golly, there are lineaments down there all over the place, going - well, northeast - yes, northeast, southwest. see it? right up on the ridge. right along all the ..., by golly. look at that."
"okay. well, actually, there's a bubble in each tube."
"and i think, bob, we're coming around different omni, so i'll wait on the rest of it."
"roger. understand. we'd like to know when you start on that heat flow, ron, because we need to get the dse to high bit rate."
"and, ron. we made a trip around the room here and the csm systems are all go. they all look good and the lunar sounder is looking good also."
huh?
"okay. we're aft omni, and we have the s and c engine control breaker closed."
"old lefty, himself. outstandingl right in the middle of the crater. stood up."
"okay, john, i'll speak to them. thank you."
"that's affirmative. on the next three rows, we only get the nine deltas, so i'll go through the next three rows completely and then you can read those back. under lighting - -"
"oh man, i tell you, we came down at just a little forward velocity. look at that - right there. about a foot slip on the pad. i tell you, there's craters all over here. okay, baby. i'd sure like to think that that wheel is where it's supposed to be. it looks good to me."
"okay, al, and on the map camera, image motion to barber pole, please."

"no. it - yeah. man, one of the feats of my exist- ence the other day was, in 42 minutes, i strapped on a bag, went out of both ends, and ate lunch."
okay.
...
just 02. 04 05 ll 33 i24p why don't i do it right now?
"hey, al, ... work out here all day. just take your time."
"well, we'll have to see what happened."

"joe, i sort of kicked through a rim of a small, 1-meter subdued crater; and, as i did that, i kicked up the white soil. and so i kicked a couple of more times and it spread out; and whether i was - breaking up a very viable rock or not, i don't know. but there was a couple of kickfuls - of dirt that was white, and as we came back past it on the - on the return trip to the lm, why, i pointed it out to jim and he saw it too. and i'm not sure whether that was just at that one small crater, which was an old crater, or whether that was typical of that particular area. we just didn't have time to look at it."
"stand by, tranquility. we'll be back with you in just a minute."
okay.
"roger. we - we just got it, bob."
"that's the one i'm talking about. see, i just broke that open."
"okay. hey, the back room gave you a bravo on your descriptions there. 04 11 07 39 lmp-i2_ i'm like a little kid on christmas eve, tony."
"wait, i'll check the ... - - 10 04 35 15 hornet apollo 12, this is hornet. i hear you loud and clear. how me? over. , 10 04 35 19 cmp roger, hornet - - - 10 04 35 20 cdr okay. head you the same. we're all okay."
"okay. i gather - you said that the heat - the leam was leveled and aligned, and i gather that meant it was on the black decal on top. do you happen to remember what number was on that?"
"15 seconds, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. 0_ 13 23 55 lmp go to 40, babe."
"but i had a little out of plane, which i think is probably wrong. okay; 20 seconds, ken."
"houston, apollo 11. i think the reason is in having 1620 on the dsky during the subsequent entries, or at least that's one possibility."
"orion, this is houston. at the present zime, it looks like you will be coming in 16,000 feev high and about 20,000 feet south,"
anti delete the last two steps.
yes. good one on the mare.
"okay. batt c, pyro batt a, and pyro batt b are 37.0. rcs a, 51; b, 63; c, 63; d, 59. go."
"oh, that's a pretty one inside!"
huh?
"wise ... wise guy. works every time, doesn't it?"
"okay, just continue marking them, john."
"it looks great, i'll tell you."
"okay. the ""verb 49 maneuver to optics cal attitude"" right at the top of the page. cross out the at- titude numbers and replace them with ""roll 164, pitch 301, and yaw 348 at a high-gain pitch angle of minus 28 and a yaw of 315."" over."
okay.
"... well, you'd think glassy pyroclastic might turn into regolith a little bit faster than some of these other things. but we'll check that one out."
"roger, 17."
"they want your omni delta, ken."
okay. okay.
(laughter)
... see that.
okay. we sep'd. helium over to b. watch those - - time skip
the dsky and the ems are about 12 feet per second difference - is all. that's pretty good.
it is clean.
"good morning, america."
"yes, but i didn't think we'd ever really quite get to that far corner. not 2, but this other one. and we're going to make it."
"no, we aren't expecting any problem. they're looking at it. they're kind of amused, but they're looking atit. and i'd like to pass up to you fellows, it's - -"
"okay, and you are locked, and you're covered. 06 21 20 03 cdr-_4 okay, z'm going to get these off the floor before ... 06 21 20 09 lmp-b_ turn around. that's okay .... _et _e ge_ that - oh."
"yes, sir. i've got a hack."
"you want me to move it to the left until it's clear, but i've got to take it out the other side of the vehicle."
that's good; i could use some.
"okay. if anybody wants to use the myrtle, we ought to use it before we get a - -"
"aquarius, houston."
okay_ bob.
"it's a shallow one. if i go over there, i'm not shielded, jack."
i know exactly what you mean.

"here, reading the oxygen at - that come out before, we still bleeding off?"
that's it. we're going -
"well, that sounds marginally acceptable."
"... charlie. you want me to check the ops, right?"
"oh, okay. i'll - i'll put it down here with my optics cover - where i keep my optics in this little ... pouch."
"okay; hut charlie is looking at it out the window, and it's not moving."
"ken, is it that little bright one right down there south of king?"
"remind me to dust my camera, too, will you?"
and it's up.
55; we're just about finished.
"okay, that's good. *** gnomon, and we won't roll it over on the gnomon."
"roger, dave. thank you."
"15, this is houston. standing by for questions on uv procedures."
"no, you're okay. you got it?"

okay.
"okay. trans control power, on."
yeah. i mean what's stars and what's - -

"hey, tony. down about a- a centimeter or less, it's all white."
"okay, geno."
"hey, gordo, we'll get everything cleaned up in the flight plan, including eating up to 59 hours, where we start checking the delta-p and pres- surizing the csm for lm entry."
"say again, john."
"- - but i just wondered if that's something we ought, to keep in mind."
"yes, i think you should. let's do everything right on the money."
"okay. scs tvc s_v0 power number 1, off."
"sounds good, jim. thank you."
oh. hard to tell.
"al, if you're not too busy now, i could send you up a science report. and i can cue you on that ga.mma ray gainstep."
"well, things have been going so well that i c_'t blame you forgetting that."
yes. it sure is nice in here.
"yeah, it is. 03 23 34 47 i2_p okay, wait a minute, now; wait a minute. okay. ac bus a: range/range rate altitude/altitude rate, close. on 11, ac bus a."

what's that? 06 00 45 24 _ the ...
okay; thank you. 06 22 12 19 _p-eva i think we're just getting to a - get to a high sun angle.
can you do it?
all right; thank you.
"apollo 16, command reset, and 0mni charlie."
"oh. gosh, it is in, isn't it? can you see it?"
got it?
"no, as - as by the flight plan. we've got to get up as by the flight plan."
okay.
"gordy, we have a - a very clear zero phase point for the earthlight. it's certainly not a strong contrast for the sun, but it's out there. and within it, again, the fresh craters tend to brighten - quite a bit more than the surrounding tape59/19 re,re. still looking at oceanus procellarum. and now, out window 3, up to the northwest, grimaldi is starting to show up - a very obvious dark area within the highlands of that part of the moon - smd one of the darkest mare regions that we have seen on the - on the moon. it's comparable, at least in the photographs, to that of tsiolkovsky."
it's going to come right off of it.
"yes, you have jupiter in my field of view, and all his little moons."
that's it.
"okay. i thimk i put kappa kappa back, i've got oscar oscar on there. how about it if i use that, okay ?"
boy! i tell you. these books aren't going to stay here.

"he dropped one, joe, thank you."
okay. go ahead.
go ahead ...
okay; will do. and we're down through 27 on the checklist. the docking probe is out. looks good. and standing by for a sequence arm and a logic check when you're ready.
"okay. you are go to con_aence the yaw maneuver. if we don't have comm after you complete the yaw maneuver, bring the power amplifier back on. over."
"optics zero, off. optics mode, manual then."
"yes, yes, yes; that's right."
"okay. here, take one quick picture so we can save some film."
about 21 hours and 52 minutes.
"that do it, houston, for you?"
"okay. 04 12 52 00 limp what have i got? a 5h, now?"

roger; copy.
goes in both directions as far as we can see.
"roger, dave. are we on photo 25?"
that's done.
thanks for salvaging me.
"roger. and down on panel 230, mass spectrometer, multiplier, high, at your convenience."
god damn it! write this time down. 144_ all zeros
okay. i'm going to open the valve again.
"good show. boy, is it cold up there, it's hot as heck down here. it's stuffy."
"and, the frame just before that - i took of a ridge just on the southern edge of crisium, - the pattern of the massifs in that area were very impressive, but two frames just before that."
"okay, tony, was that bearing and ran - was that at stop 5?"
"well, there's that first crater, there, jack. 05 2i 42 41 lmp-eva 080?"
"challenger and america, about 2 minutes to los now, and both spacecraft are looking good."
"say again, don."
okay. go.
"the rake is on the rover. the scoop's on the rover. we got the - you put the core under your pan, right?"
"as a matter of fact, if you guys keep working on your ground vectors, they might even converge to the onboard vectors pretty soon."
"270, houston."
"we're trying to calculate how much s_,agb t*' and meatballs we can get on _ _ard fe"
"roger. what appears to be the limit of reso- lution through that sextant from your current position? over. 02 00 46 39 i24p well, i can't see it right now. it's out- side the field of view. 02.00 46 43 cc roger."

"from the nominal time line, you're down about 30 minutes now."
"t0, 37 - -"
control yourself. control yourself.
take a look.
"before you pull any more power off. in other words, do your circuit breakers. we want you to wait on that until 180:30, which is about 18 min- utes from now. 07 12 400 43 l_p roger. _e copy. 0nly thing we got left over here is the suits, and we'll get them over now."
"yes, we've been watching that one."
"yeah, ... the rcs command is off, too."
"okay, i'll do that. just a second here."
"i'll draw it out - i'll step it out for you. you can measure it. (laughter) lj_p-eva well, i don't know. should i ts_ke my gloves off? i mean my cover gloves."
good morning. are you planning a midcourse cor- rection 4 this morning?
"okay, i'm going to terminate the landing radar test, if that's okay with y'all."
"okay, houston. this is the coarse align torquing angles, and we'll torque at 08:45."
okay. go ahead.
go ahead.
"roger, ed. i was i minute late on that - on the mapping camera. we got it started at i - at 174:51."
"yes. i understand, joe. !"
"you notice, that signal strength doesn't stay as high as i thought it would, do you think? has it ever come up full on the high gain, charlie? or is that as high as it's gotten?"
okay. i've got a mark next to riccioli g - riccioli golf. is that correct?
i go over and get the - -
"okay, you guys."
"well, i still had a little bit of film when the cooldown - the 2-minute cooldown period was left, so i went back to high on the flow pattern just to see what would happen. and it looked like they were starting out with - again larger-sized cells developing into smaller ones. and, initially, all of the cells were about a half an inch in diameter, and they were closer to the periphery of the dish than they were in the low flow positi©n."
"15, houston. our comm's quieted down again, and _- i'll continue if you're ready."
try it on the - i know it - try it on the - -

good thought.
"and, fred, request pcm on lo bit rate, now."
"okay. that sim code should be, ""plus all l's"" and then, ""0, all 2's."""
"copy that. and when we leave we want to take ep number 8 with us, guys. %_e'd like the sep turned back on and the blankets closed. okay, jack, i guess that's your option, you may - -"

"okay; well, we only have 50 - 50 percent remaining."
"it stabilized about - oh, minus 150."
that was only after insertion.
"okay. okay. then from ""cycle 5 frames, replace dark slide,"" from there on down, delete."
don't let it get low.
"well, i'm working mine. there's both."
okay.
"stand by. we'll get ii;for you - - 04 15 ]5 22 cmp how many, jack?"
right. that's right.
"okay. and i guess now on the levas, what we're suggesting is you put them - put the two of them in by themselves in a sleep restraint and tie it down on top of a-8. and i've got a lot of fancy words about how to tie it down on top of a-8, if you guys can't figure out how to do it. i can read it off to you, or we can leave it to your intuitive good sense."
yeah.
"john, houston."
"okays give me the count from zero. that's what i'm marking on. okay, al, i'm ready."

"okay. fine. we do want you to wait until all the dumps are completed, and then open the doors and turn alpha particle on at your convenience, really. 08 01 54 10 imp roger."
sure will.
"yes. we can't get it to come down to narrow. we tried to switch to auto track or reacq, and it - yaw drives around from 270 to 0. and pitch goes from about 6 degrees around to 90. i'm trying - we're fitting it manual now at the angles that you gave us, and i'll try and get you in medium and narrow beam widths picking it up manually here."
- - we got sir lovell down there to - -
"yes. oh, there it goes, there. looks kind of empty down there without the lm - -"
- - ... supposed to be. they're absolutely worthless.
i did.
"that's affirm, isn't it? and we were told this '_ morning before launch that that was nominal."
okay. let me get the jettison bag out of the way.
"so are you, john."
okay. stand by. circuit breakers are verified open.
"okay. i understand mass spec, experiment, on; and ion source, on. stand by. david, can you get a couple of switches over there? the mass spec, experiment, on; and the i0n source, on."
"okay, and we can get our helmets off. lmip-lm if i can ever get unsuited. oh, this is funny. (laughter) that's my hand. let me try the other one,"

"falcon, houston. no tweak."
okay. go to 161:34.
knocking.
"okay, gordy. if you're happy with noun 22, i'll enter them."
outstanding.
"oh, okay."
"apollo 13, houston."
looks like it's a little bit easier than doing that in the chamber.
"why don't you call a noun 75, if you could?"
steering is good; gdc ball's good; needle is good.
okay.
75 hours 37 minutes get.
... charlie.
"okay, look up over my - our right side and lock at that antenna, _he - the steerable, and see how it - it's moving. i'm going to move it in pitch_ then in yaw. over."
"okay, the throttledown was on time, essentially. and we're on descent fuel 2."
okay; thank you.

"*** got hot in here, didn't it? okay; purge valve to depress; *** your circuit breakers."
okay; can you swing right out over there - -
we get the - the pro?
"oh, i - you know, i think we can do it with ..."
"right. back to our lighting circuit breaker. _- let me emphasize two main points to start with. i guess under no circumstances do we want to close that circuit breaker. and a second - problem is a - a - a second point is that we don't want to change the integral lighting, or the numerics lighting rheostats on panel 100. let's leave them just as they are. and then there's the - there is a possibility due to the fact that there is a very tape _9/10 low amperage shunt going around that circuit breaker, there is a possibility that we do have lights on the dsky status lights; that is, the up-link activity lights, et cetera. and if we can go through a quick procedure here, we'll find out whether or not we do have lights there. shall we go ahead?"
"okay. al, are you on your way?"
that's ... we'll have some other information ...
i know.
okay?
wait - -
"okay, bob. the star sextant checks out okay."
"soft cover has gone. okay, i'm going after the hook."

"okay. the battery 2 temperature reads wha_ ..., charlie?"
and these two - see these two craters?
"okay, thank you, deke. 07 12 02 06 ncc roger."
"wait a minute, gordo, and i'll just let you load it as we go here."

"okay, houston. this is challenger. how do you read? we're high gain and data. 04 13 56 13 i24p hello, houston; how do you read challenger?"
"you may have. because i'm - let's see, ready to take - yes, i've only got ll more pictures on here. i'm sitting on number 30, ready to take picture n_nber 30."

"yes, but i can't put that thing ... intervalometer."
okay.
should we torque about 50?
"well, you can take it and put it away for all i give a shit right now."
go ahead.
"okay, f:5.6 at 1/250th. 125. okay?"
okay.
"well, what is basically the problem with it?"

and you want to - you want to review it at all?
we'll have to put it right here to get it level.
okay. and at 131:19.
"roger. just a reminder here, we want to make sure you leave the rendezvous radar circuit breakers pulled. however, we want the rendez- vous radar mode switch in lgc, just as it is on surface-59."
"okay, i just took one frame at 1/15th."

"and on the lm side, we were in ags min deadband att hold; and at contact, i thrusted plus-x; and shortly after that we had a sizable attitude oscillation and thruster firing, so we opened up the deadband to max and manually flew the vehicle into stable attitude during the retrac- tion. it went to off after ..."
"this is ron. on my last one, it was just a spot flash. no direction to it at all."
every now and then you get a blizzard. it looks just like you're really drowning in ...

"that's the reason. yes, yes, yes."
okay. they're migrating toward plus y.
"oh, yes."
wait a minute. i'll reverify it. okay. s-bandt/r.

yes.
"okay. we're so efficient down here that we got _m entry pad ready, fred. do you want to copy that for jack? over."
"roger, jim. sounds good. 05 22 47 42 _p-eva okay. i'm going to be transferring some core tubes."
what you - what you taking?
okay. should you have system b shutoff valve closed? 03 23 45 33 i/mp right now we do. i'm going to turn it on in a minute. but let's go - okay.
"apollo 13, houston."
and 1/500th of a second.
okay.
"and, geno, when you push the rover circuit breakers in, how- about giving us a battery temperature reading on the rover bats."
yeah.
"okay. standing by, jim."

"okay, jim. gc ahead and turn it back off, here."
there's b.
"okay. pitch is about minus 20 degrees; yaw is 190; and the agc - i'll give it to you in clock code for 12 o'clock; it's about - about 45; in other words, i'd estimate about three-quarter full scale."
"and, endeavour, houston. when you get a moment, we'll take your read-outs from the last p52."
"not sore, are you? i hope we can see our descent stage."
"()kay. okay, tony, i'm leaving with t00 and - about 161."

you better believe it.
"okay. 17-1. you ready? c,mp yes."
"*** got my - man, i tell you, this little navigation map i've got on my hand - cuff checklist is - is unquestionably the greatest thing that i've ever - done."
roger.
an-ha! thank you.
okay. the purpose for these were - was to protect the e-memory from other programs.
"oh, yes. better, if anything."
"dave, let us suggest to you that you go ahead and deploy the lr cubed. and, jim, another reminder on your antenna."
roger.
"after 8 days, we finally got organized on this eating. ken cuts it open, i fill it with water, and charlie eats it."

"okay. on mike, 119:34:30.00."
"that's not fair. i was really going to - i really did forget, because i was going to engage you in some verbal discourse to distract you so that you would let me forget it and i could redeem myself."

okay.
here's your seatbelt.
okay. i'll do that.
"joe, is there any - you got any more debriefing questions?"
"yeah. mine are the same way, and i cut mine. i don't think it has anything to do with that."
it's done. it's done.
"i'll read them out to you, al."
"thank you, sir."
"okay. houston, how do you read cdr?"
- - plus 1331. / _ that 's good.
why don't you?
roger.
"yes, i did; d_n right, i did."
"okay, 15. we got a clarification on that. the ""laser altimeter, off"" is at 201:30. the ""mapping camera/laser altimeter cover, close"" is called out at 201:32. and we want to delete both of those."
"okay, we'll verify it. stand by. it's checked but we'll check it again."
and those black and white blocks - you can see them all over the place.
"and, dave, while you're rolling there, requesting forward steering to bus c, bus charlie."
"that's correct. now, i'd like to verify the surge tank and repress packages are on. ()507 '_1iz cml' v_._rifysurge tank and repress package are on. 05 0'( %1 16 cc that's correct. on panel 5: circuit brewer environmental - contro!, systa]_; waste water/ urine dump heater, two of them, closed."

47.0.
"tranquility base, houston. over."
"well, they may find some crude control mode that you could use in here that would make it oscillatory but not unstable. it's the divergence ... it's tracking. if it had been just the ... we got to go ahead and burn; then we go ... the moon."
how about that! we have you in a 65.2 by 54.6.
this is it - it's got to be it. it's got a nice raised rim on it. pf_lrlr_rklti aj

"don't let us bother you, ron. you just go about and do whatever you want to do. we'll just get clean for the next 3 days. c_ okay."
"yeah, let's just call that our rake sample."
"intrepid, houston. go ahead."
"i thrusted toward you 3.5. yeah, that was - looks like both in retrograde."
"you're having some problem reeling it in there, ed?"
servo power's off.
...
okay.
"okay. and for your informat_ion, all of our numbers are based on amperage usage of 14 amps. and we're using only 12.3, so we're a little fat on our analysis."
"oh, yes. we're all set to go. _o sweat, it says here in fine print."
"okay, ken. it looks real good, and you can go ahead now with the e._ and the p52. pane 259"
okay. 05 02 04 o1 iaip-eva the back of - the bottom of the bit is with bravo - and i'm going back out and take some pictures.
okay.
... now.
and we'll have to switch co_i carriers so i can take this suit stuff off.
i'm looking out window 3.
okay ......
set delta-v c.
okay.
"roger. we are. i got 3 seconds, 2 seconds, i second. how's that? there."
okay. we've got to reverse the rolls of the camera here.
"this thing says i have to have four servo loops to do the circ. every time i put number 2 servo on, it's okay until i disturb it, and then it starts to oscillate. and you can feel the spacecraft shaking. it's really doing it."
okay. you're covered. okay. i think we're getting to our favorite part here. (laughter) okay. purge valves are installed on both. pga diverter valve; put it vertical. 04 17 57 40 ibs°-lm okay. it's vertical.
"hello, houston; 17. are you reading?"
"copy, 146 on auto[mobile]. _-eva bob, you know, the more i look at this - watch out for those babies there - at this - at this dark dust, if you will, the more it doesn't seem like the kind of thing you'd expect to have been derived from the underlying bedrock. but i think you're going to have to play that game in the lab right now."
"well, ... try ..."
"okay, drill's out of the mesa."
i - i've got to go right. i got to go right.
ail right - -
"okay, and then starting two lines dowv: where it's ""bat 1 low voltage, on,"" et cetera, just scratch the whole rest of those lines in that box. 07 23 22 07 i2,_ okay. 07 23 22 !0 cc okay, below that, step l, ""transfer to l_,( power,"" you cbt scratch all of those lines, all five."
okay.
how about this one?
"in case we don't get comm before the burn, and at this point you're go for the burn, the only thing you haven't done is look at your target load. you still have to enable the jets, according to the flight plan, and when you do your pre-sps burncard on the sim bay, you'll be turning the alpha particle and x-ray off and going to boost on the pan camera."
say it again. 1 point zero - -
can you - can you reach those water hoses right there?
sure ....
"jim, i'll go around the north here and - avoid the dust. our trusty alsep."
"apollo 15, select omni charlie, and stow the high gain, please. 01 06 47 11 cml° roger, joe. omni charlie, and stow the high gain."
"i'm not for crowding it in, but let's do three of them!"
okay. you want it 2 seconds?
when is aos this rev? did they give us a map - - 03 12 03 46 i2zp they didn't. they - -

okay.
"and, endeavour; this is houston. you're coming up on 8 minutes to los. and we'll just go over the tei procedures c_ the next rev. no hurry on that at all."

... this is really ...
yes. you're looking good.
okay. i'm about ready to clean up the rover here.
"must have the wrong thing, there."
"all right. you've got it. okay, now the mass spec experiment is going to on. the ion source is going to standby. 04 10 07 25 cml° alpha particle and x-hay door is coming open - -"
i'll hold the bag.
stand by for another earth weather picture. i'll give you a mark.
we only got 20 minutes here. i'll start the pan.

we copy.
and that ledge looks like it's caused by a - a harder material.
"okay, joe."
yes.
okay. we'll soon find out.
"not using any thrusters, are you?"
i don't think there's anything in there.

okay. tlme skip
(laughter)
roger. copy.
"okay, jack. we'll have a pad for you in a few minutes. we're getting data now on the tracking, and although we suspect the changes from your preliminary pad will be very small, we reco_nend that you hold off on initializing the em until we get you the final pad. over."
"jim, the situation is that, at the moment, we're a little bit shallow, and retrograde midcourse is going to put us more in the center of the corridor. over. 04 06 5;' 27 cdh okay; fir_e. i just, wanted to make .m_re. fred had writ, l,_rl d_wrl_ r;ome time _,/_, t,hat- l,hat our _mgle now war; about 71 and we were going to do a midcourse of 7 feet per second because ire appears that we're going to shallow it out. i think we're all talking the same language now."

okay. ease down here. okay.
"yes. that's probably the culprit, but let's - -"
"i have them now. now, which pan's do you want me to take? over here?"
i doubt that. maybe for the cayley plains saturday afternoon shindig.
"*** get some regular pictures on this set. okay. here's the *** won't come off, this one will."
that's negative; just tank 2. we want tank ± to stay in auto.
okay. disconnect lm hoses. (rai_q)

i think itm gonna sit down and think some more about that td&e.

"well, now."
i'm sorry. do you want to try putting it in the bag?
"okay, ron, when they give us that 3, i'll get your hose. jack can hold it in the cabin, you can activate your ops. cml° okay."

"hey, jim. we got the rendezvous radar in detent, too. can we move it out of the way or can we select another star?"
okay. got it.
"no, i'll get it out."
roger. that was .7.
"jack, have you got the top of the bag closed?"
okay.

"yes, i'm ready. two seconds."

yes. we ......
"and, i sure get the impression that - almost looks like a slump feature, but we'll take some good pictures of that, because you see the same lineal - linear-type pattern in the - the east side of the rille. and note the linear pattern there is par- allel. almost like layering in the rille. and, then as you look upslope - up the front, that layer- ing takes that - that dip to the northeast that dave had mentioned earlier."
that's a smart one.

(laughter)
"yes, boy."
roger. we got it. copy that - under the lmp's seat.
"okay. understand you want me to position pitch, _ minus 10, yaw pi - yaw to 251; go reacq, narrow, and m-ke sure the squelch is off."

"roger. overhead dump valve, closed. maybe jim has a point there, though."
thank you.
"okay, houston on the - the craters is to the north of the wright brothers. the slope of the walls is steep - probably 45 degrees on the inside - it's a gradual slope on the outside sllp- ping away from the crater. there is no apparent albedo differences in the ejecta or patterned an- nulus around the crater itself and we're looking specifically at the one to the northwest of the wright brothers, now. there is a definite mare flow that is unindated [sic], and it's a different color and, you know, that you have a light albedo to it now, it's kind of a grayish tan. it's a light grayish tan material that has flowed - and i can't tell - it almost looks like it's flowed down to the crater. there is an impact crater right in the breach of the crater - which has nothing to do with the flow itself. the material in the - i'm almost out of sight of it already. i was going to say the material in the inner crater in these boulder ring structures down there - the materi_l all the way in the center of it is comparable to the h-mmocky, bumpy looking type stuff that is not really the mare - not the smooth mare of smythli - but the other part of the mare of smythii."

that's him. he's bigger than hell right there.
"look i - i can't understand you. oh, you wanted this right here."
okay; 216 - use - -
mine's here ....
"say again there, gene."
"okay, understand that you'll want us to terminate battery charge for a while, and crank up the cm tm to read out temperatures. and you have a few changes to jack's checklist, and i'll turn the comm over here to jack shortly, as soon as he's finished, and we'll get along with it."

right there?
"okay, we've got it. we'll reverse the _ and the cdr's audio panels."
"okay, ed. mapping camera going off."
"what? 02 ii0 16 47 cc that's affirmative, odyssey. _md also get your scs electronics package and power off, and your fdai power/gpi off, and your auto jet select, all 16 off."
"yeah, summarize it for us, please."
"we sure will, al."
"15 this is houston. it looks as though the dse voice down link is acceptable, now; and we'll do it your way."
0kay. we've got you.
"okay, t-31, 134 plus 16 plus 54."
"we averaged about 5-1/2 hours' sleep apiece, and we are estimating that the sleep was good."
we got that.
okay. real fine.
i think you better write in something separate.
"okay, houston. ready to copy."
no. no. i think - i think it's all self- explanatory now.
"okay, baby, just go on there - nice. the last - the last one is foxtrot. and it's on tight."
"apollo 11, this is houston. over."
"apollo 15, houston. 09 07 01 07 _ go ahead."
"roger. i was sure of that, gene. just wanted to make it - put everybody at ease that it's just not working. that was essentially the test. just forget anything we said about tests."
"okay, it's a lm impact tca and it's _ime is _'p0:35 a_d vhe camera data is cm5, el, 250, cex, _/_.6, z/lz_, infinity. _z_d magazine _ao_a kappa or kilo kilo, and you can use up lo i0 frames on it,. over."

"okay. underztand. philosophy on the midcourse i:; doinl_ il, prior to venting oi' the [;lie tank, which me,ms we'll be doing this around 105 hours, i suppose, or 105:30 _md so i'll have control of the spacecraft if it should give us some per- turbation."
"yes, this crater -"
but you're going to have to help me get this camera off; i can't get it off.
"okay. receiver's been dusted and blankets are open; power is off and off. okay. i'm going to take the tge off now, or dust it and then take it off, and then just leave it there. hey, congratu- late jose on that fender will you, because i think he just saved us an awful lot of problems. he and whoever else worked on it."
two minutes. it's working now.
"roger. copy 4.2, 3.9, 4.1, 4.2, greater than, and 4.5."
okay.
"okay, bob, i'm reading 089, 20.1, 002, 92, 88. volts are 65 and 66. batteries are i - 14 and 138. rear motors are off scale low. forward left is off scale low and right is 210 degrees."
i don't know. we're making good time.
"okay, jack. that got us warmed up for the midpac area entry pad."
"roger. rest period is number 7. 04 10 39 36 lmp-_ and we got a - oh, okay, rest period is 7. i see. okay. and then 8 is postsleep."
"okay, gordo, what was the f-stop for the highlands terminator?"
"okay. i'll - probably not have an answer for you tonight, but first thing in the morning - some- place to put them."
okay.

"roger. hot from the wires of the msc public affairs office, especially prepared for the crew of apollo ll."
would you believe i tried to blow the window off (chuckle ).
wait a minute. stand by.
"okay, dave; this is houston. how do you hear me now?"
yours is up.
"go ahead, houston."
ha-ha-ha-ha.
"man, henry, we're not going to be in attitude _til 192:14. is that acceptable?"
roger. we copy.

i don't think they do. i bet you they don't.
there you go. there you're thinking.
"apollo 15, houston. over."
okay. don't fall into that ... excuse me.
can't see the lm today.
"houston, do you read aquarius?"
"go ahead. 04 05 59 _8 cc okay, we want on panel ]2, track mode switch, off; on panel 16, primary transmitter/receiver circuit breaker, open; s-band antenna heater circuit breaker, open; s-band antenna comm circuit breaker, open; and primary s-band power amplifier, open. then on panel 11, ac bus s-band antenna, open. over."
i ...
stand up?
that's roger. and we'll get back to you at that point.
"okay. i suspect it's probably to our advantage, even though the cutter works good, that we probably ought to go ahead and run it out. that's your call though."
"super down here, dave and jim. from what i heard, it was not only a good landing, it was a great landing. and it sounds like you didn't even bend i anything."
"it's a very pretty scarp. no, i used vhbw."
"at 274:15, on your verb 49 attitude - 09 19 5_ 25 cmp all right."
"i will throw one thing right quick, you know the activation descent day, that was the third one i had handled, and including all the simulations and all the three of the actual flights, i think it's the first time we can say that we really did it all right. for one reason or another, it really turned out to be a fairly easy day and i was really surprised."
"okay, just like before."
roger. good show. we'd like to see it if it'll reach that far. over. 01 ]0 25 57 lmp we'll give it a try. oi lo 25 59 cc roger.
you got the high gain antenna in heacq?
copy that.
"hey, ed .... get myrtle back ..."
yes.
"and, 15, we verify that your pan camera is in, and you can turn the power, off, on it."
okay.
"yes. well, they lost a fender, and it was throwing dust up on gene. it's just ridiculous how much dust they got on them, so they - they just decided they just had to go ahead and do something."
"okay, we got a gray? ll2 d[ da5y"
yes.
because we don't want to wipe out - thank you. thank you. that's the dimension i need.
yes. i've cleaned mine.
"houston, 16. over."
"(laughter) well, i don't know."
you've got your full measure of rock right here. okay. let me go get the sample bags.
yeah. it's so it won't get scratched ...
"you - you're ahead a whole - hour ahead. there you go. 180, 269, 0."
okay. i'm getting the probe umbilical installed now.
"absolutely outstanding. i can't say more than that. and i mean it from the bottom of my heart or the bottom of my soul or something, my conscience."
sure do.
"okay. it probably isn't out yet. the reason we had you stop was because the recorder that's watching that broke down, down here. we got to get that back on line."
he says he did.
..
(laughter)
i don't either.
"_hat's fine. hey, we have the tv back on on the moon up there, and everything's looking fine. it hasn't changed much since you left."
let me get out of your way.
"go ahead, houston."
sure thing.
"and in the figure, where you have the ""dac los"" line, which is parallel to the x-axis on the horizon, cross out ""dac los"" parallel to x-axis on horizon."
"okay, thanks much."
"hello, houston; this is america."
we've got l/4-14. go ahead.
"well, the brightest crater i've seen is the one that was right on the rim, halfway up st. george, and it's almost white. and - is that the one you're thinking about?"
yes.
mark.
okay. it's in work.
"and, dave, the fine tune heading is 279."
"okay, the mapping camera is coming on to standby."
- - rad heater going to prim 1.
you remember who took - -
"probably that, and the combination of going in dark."
(laughter) 07 22 25 05 imp ... sunrise.
"houston, 17."
two to ac.
42.
...
okay.
ok_. thank you. 07 13 50 38 cml° how did that plane change - the tracking work out on that plane-change burn? is that okay?
"okay, that's good. let's go - go with the pad value, 55124. 2-18 nftden"
... falcon ...
"okay. i'm going to get on the sunset - sunlit side, tony, so i'll know what - i'll know what i'm whacking on here. you know, tony. that might be a permanently shadowed soil right in there. i think it is, as a matter of fact. it'll - it'll pas._."
"0kalf, houston, the - - time skip"
that's all correct. and the next is a tei-5 pad.
right at the terminator. right at it.
"okay. 185:57:25; 186:02:15; 03:55; and 04:43. it's south 03 nautical miles. cml° okay, 17-1. 185:57:25; 186:02:15; 03:55; 04:43; south 3 miles."
"15, houston; we have a correction to that update, if you'd get the flight plan back out please. 07 12 03 47 imp okay, go ahead."
"houston, this is 15. we were just looking at the urine transfer device, and that valve was in the op_ position, although the device wasn't capped."
"roger. copy. 03 03 29 32 i_p yeah, a big - a rounded surface of clinkers. it's fantastic. boy, is that rough!"
"okay; 20 seconds, ken."
"what the bucket of worms is, is old dumb-dumb here is turning the wrong direction. tape §3/10 05 06 42 52 ia_p-lm okay, ed. john's ops is 5900 and mine is 6 - about 6050."
okay.
"yes, we see it, joe."
"15, we'd like to have omni charlie."
doing great.
"loud and clear, houston. how me?"
yeah.
"okay, you want to - where do you want to go? there's a place right up here, john, that looks like it's a good - -"
"okay, pete. on that battery management, when we get to that time, just give me a call, if you will. over."
(laughter) i know it.
"very well, joe, we'll get you a core right here."
"map., we got a lot of rocks, that's for sure. 04 08 39 22 lmp-l_ how's it looking, jim?"
roger. we're ready. go.
"did you see that mighty leap, fredo?"
"ll, houston."
"okay, gordon. i'm ready to copy."
"and, endeavour; houston. a couple of changes to the command module - i_4/command module transfer list on stowage items, when you get a break."
"endeavour, this is houston."
"if we hadn't talked about this beforehand, you know, i wouldn't feel quite so irritated. but we talked about this very specific problem, and i talked to all the flight directors about it. it's - if you've got to regroup with the kind of flight plan we've got, just emasculate pieces. don't try to reschedule. and they all agreed, that's right; if you have to reschedule and re- write, we'll get even less done. and that's all i've done for 3 days. and my efficiency has got to be low. that's scmething. gee, charlie, i don't know. i'll be darned."
great. go ahead.
"roger. t. is 125:26:15.47. lg 04 22 41 49 cml° okay, that is 25:26:15.47."
okay.
"okay, hank. how's that in - wide beam?"
okay. the main thing is to make sure that we have a crater that's big enough - -
okay.
where at?
"ken, our pitch has got off a little bit. we need about a 120 degrees in pitch also."
say again what your best guess is to this thing?
let me finish the stereo around the corner here. 06 19 _l 19 cc okay. and you guys have dropped the scoop there on the ground. and we're ready for you guys to leave.
"yes, we did. okay. my water *** open."
"hey, joe, how about bag - oh, well, okay - bslss bag."
open.
"okay, if that's powell. quite a ways over there, but i think the thing to do is get up on that little ridge there."
...
"hey, great"
"you're pointed right at station 6, i think, gene."
"no. photo tv mirror: f:8, 5 feet - -"
it sure sounds like it.
"oh, you're right. okay."
okay. we confirm that. three ... core tubes is the only ones we're worried about bringing back.
"hey, when fido gets a good hack on our trajectory, will you let us know?"
here they come.
i wouldn't mind - ......
"okay, good show. 05 15 26 41 _ rock box in one hand."
we got them.
yes.
how's your hand for harmnering?
okay.
"yes. that's what we found here. yes. i'd say that, in the - in the near field, the surface is covered by - probably less than i percent of frag- mental debris. and, of that debris, i'd say 70 per- cent of it is on the order of an inch to 2 inches, or less. and maybe the other 30 percent seems to be in a range of maybe 4 or 5 inches, something like that; no large frags anywhere. they mostly- -"
"that's right. well, not every fragment, mo- many of these clods don't have any at all. most of them don't have any glass. get that one there. get me a - oh, you got a bag, okay. just a sec- ond here."
"- - pitch, minus - right. and the high gain's pitch, minus 47, to yaw - and yaw, 59."
give me a yell when you need a spell there.
roger.
roger. looks like you g_ys are ready to go to work.
"lley,could you say again the td&e i'uel? we've got a different - we ali heard different things."
"- - 225 - what did you say, bob? 225 what? cc 234/2.1- -"
is it in here?
"say again, falcon."
"okay, and down here where it says ""sps checklist,"" we're deleting that only because your sps cue card is - is marked up so bad. and so, the - the reason why - let's - let's at least say you don't use the cue card as written, which you wouldn't, but we just want to make that point. and in the space in there between ""compare solution in tpi,"" i've got three lines for you. the first one is, ""space- craf_ control, scs, after auto maneuver."" the next line is, and here again this is sort of superfluous, but it's ""bmag mode, three, att i/rate 2."" and then, just to sum it all up, could we add a note, ""use scs burn procedures, if required."
"okay, jim. sounds good. we'll be standing by for your mark."
"houston, challenger."
"no, you're right on the time line."
mark.
"apollo 13, houston. los in about 1 minute. at los we would like command reset and then normal."
i'll get it; keep going. he lost the core tube.
"okay, ron. that pan camera - -"
"okay, let's get - we'll take it easy, bob. i think it's a great deal a part to just get accustomed to handling yourself in zero gravity, the only vice on the moon."
"okay, and the lower left."
"and, aquarius; houston. we've got you both on vox. pat? 203"
yeah.
put these in my bag. ia{p-eva - - inclusions in it.
better stay that way because we've got a problem over - -
"negative. i'll tell you in a minute, john. 06 21 33 12 i24p-i2_ okay, 2 minutes. we're down at zero on the gage. want me to try it, john?"
you clipped. say again.
"15, this is houston. we'd like to verify, over on panel 226, that the 02 tank 50-watt heater circuit breakers, i main b and 2 maina are open. and, if they're not open, let's open them."
"hello, houston; this is endeavour."
"well, so far, we've kept pretty much with most of your recommendations around here. i think we could probably hack that one, too."
"say goodnight, dick, huh? one last word. you know, we're always hounding you guys - really don't mean to - but we - we'd like to see a clear dsky so something doesn't buru out. don't know the exact words on that, but -"
"i'm in. okay, john."
"okay. that's the way we'll operate. i'm going to the gamma ray, deploys at this time. i'm going to hold it for barber pole plus 2 seconds, then off. going to deploy. deploy. barber pole now, 1, 2_ off; and it's gray. gamma ray is coming to retract."
what do you mean?
"0 zero, o zero. give them another ags update."
mode select is pgi_s.
okay. here it comes. i can see daylight through it.
roger. that did it. thank you.
"as a matter of fact, i think this is - this is flank right here."
(music)
"we know there's a lot of scientists from a num- her of countries standing by to see the lunar samples, and we thought you'd be interested to see them as they really are here. these two boxes are the sample return container_'_. they - they're vacuum-packed containers that were closed in a vacuum on the lunar surface, sea]ed, and then brought inside the lm and put inside these fiber-glass bags, zippered, and resea},ed around the outside, and placed in these rece]_tacles in the side of the command module. thes_ are the two boxes. and as soon as we get onto the ship, (gos[_ nh""f 1) t,'lp,' _100/'4 i'm sure these boxes will immediately be t_'ans- ferred and delivery started to the lunar ieceiv- ing laboratory. these boxes include the samples of the various types of rock, the groundmass of the soil, the sand and silt, and the particle collector for the solar wind experiment, and the core tubes that took depth samples of the lunar surface."
188/0.9.
"okay, vance. are you with me?"
"pete, could you hold - hold that a minute?"
"... cml_ z think you're going to have to go to attitude o. you're bouncing around more on the probe. 2'ee, i'm not moving at all."
"17, we're not reading the noun 85s. would you read them to us? c_p okay. noun 85s were minus 0.1, a plus 0.1, and plus 0.2."
off.
come down now?
...
gc ahead°
"okay. they look good to us, also."
**# that.
look over here.
"and i think you probably have both. excuse me, gene."
coming down at you.
"okay. stand by. let me verify his configuration. okay. you should be in ar. okay, you're in ar. they are going to call you. okay, bruce. on my mark, i will go to relay on and stand by for your call. in 20 or 30 seconds, i'll come back, if no comm. 3, 2, 1."
okay. the vacuum brush is there?
"well, we're heading directly downhill, now. we're cross-sun. /"
"okay, joe. and you're suggesting using an upper here?"
"no signal strength, al."
they'll retract. and let me know when.
i heard that part.
roger.
that's the same question that was bothering us.
"hello, houston."
roger. we're ready for a logic sequence check.
"okay, we're right on the time line. right to the minute."
"*** before you go back *** down after a picture here. and i want to get a pan of this thing. *** stereo pan *** your radial sample. l_-eva *** you take the after from there, and i'll go over here and--"
"wait, i'm not through."
"one pitching over, about - -"
"okay, ken, let's just forget this. i think you went clownbelow us, and - we're going to pdi attitude, and why don't you go to your comm attitude. 04 01 59 12 c_ okay, what i'm trying to do is to keep from hitting you. i'd like to get a visual on you. 04 o! 59 22 cdr well. 02 01 59 3h lmp _ghy don't you just do a pitch - getting on the belly band and do a pitch around, john."
"okay. how about - you ready for some other readouts, that you wanted there?"
nah.
"hey, gordo, what day is it?"
...
"copy, 158."
"that's right, i never - look at it and make sure it's charging like it's supposed to. see if you don't have any - what the hell is that? 06 20 49 01 cml° ouch! sticks out there a long way."
"- - piece of cake, john. okay."
"- - ask you to walk around to the front there, and just take a general rough guess as to where the earth is. you don't even have to use the sighting device. point it about correctly, and we're going to give the tv a try."
okay.
ready for suit flow.
next item: request hydrogen tank i heater off for balancing purposes.
... disappear.
why don't you - here we go.
"16, we figure the time is about up on the alfmed experiment. we'd like to know if the motor is stopped."
"it's their problem, i think."
okay. copy that.
"okay, houston. it appears to be okay now; we've changed our attitude slightly, and i have a star and i'm maneuvering to get the m-line parallel."
...
okay.
"aquarius, houston. read you now satisfactory. or 22 14 36 t,mp okay_ _am_dthat's _rrs ,,,"
okay.
"all smells like hydrogen, really."
yes.
okay.
"okay. we need the experiment switch to on down there in the alpha - excuse me, the mass spec ex- _'_ periment switch to on; and the i0n source, on. over."
and hank. i'm up on biomed and no - arrhythmias - don't count.
"traction *** seems q_ite good. *** *** three asterisks denote clipping of words and phrases.

roger; copy. apollo 16 air-to-ground voice transcription
okay. thank you.
okay. how is the ranging check going?
looks like they're hogging the window.
"okay. s-band, pm, pri_l_ry, primary again, off, pcm, range, off, and hi."
roger. auto.
"somebody had - had his nose up against window 3, here. got to wipe it off. boy, these windows have really been great though. they haven't - you know - don't have any coatings or anything like that on them."
okay. understand. 04 06 59 _8 cdr the name is battery charger bat b charge jack tells me.
"houston, apollo 15."
"power amp, off; lo bit rate. _"
"okay, understand. the first three go with those programs, and the cmc thrust vector control is sufficient by itself."
"okay, orion; houston. thank you very much - that's enough - giving it a try and reconfigure your vhf back to a nominal configuration."
okay. we're showing about 5.2 right now.
"volt 39.4, amp 1.23."
"pete, we show you're 1 plus 14 into the eva, and we'd like you to move on from this crater at about 1 plus 27. if you could, then, go on down and take a look at the bedrock on the bench. ©nfidenti"
"okay, buzz. the first item is that we have indica- tions that your landing site obliques are not in the proper position. if you'll check, we chink that the intermediate-scale landing site oblique is stowed in the csm lunar landmark book. we think that the large-scale landing site oblique is stowed in the back of the _4 lunar surface map book. over."
roger. can you see any expression of that central feature out to the north?
and i'm in a 65.2 by 54.8.
okay; the bus ties came off normally. i noticed when i set it up that - just before putting them on that bus b - battery b was reading a little bit lower than the others. it was reading about 34.
okay.
roger. we got the boys in the backroom working overtime.
"okay, 74:18 is los."
"okay, i got the hack. wait a minute. there we go. got her. okay. happy with all your ecs behind you?"
i guess it's about time for a little verb 49 to the p52 attitude. how's that suit you?
just out of the way.
endeavour copies.
i think it would be too. oh 04 51 08 i_mp huh?
"roger that. we're still having difficulty with the eo_m, orion. hopefully, very shortly, we'll get the net up for you."
"no. golly, that rover, really. okay. let me get under here. there we go a little bit, it's working."
"and i thought i'd just take about 5 seconds here and see if i could get 000 gone, since _e're fairly close to gimbal lock right now."
and xllll.
okay. anything there is a big help.
i finally found what i was looking for. i got the man in the moon.
"at 600 feet, we want 5, john."
okay. i'll do a verb 76 enter with the mode control att hold and then 30 clicks of right yaw to set the maneuver.
"okay, gordy. certainly is clear up here. you're coming through 5 by at signal strength 3.2, and - all appearances up here, that previous problem was an up-link. but i guess you were not reading me. is that correct?"
double h-dot _lmost - -
"logic power a, open."
"wait a minute; wait a minute. okay, keep the trigger pulled. trigger pulled. let her go. now try it again. try it again. that's it, babe. no strain. okay, let me put it on."
how come you don't ...?
"okay. 05 00 l0 37 i24p-eva dave, i have the camera all configured for those pictures."
"boy, what a ride that challenger gave us coming down. what a ride."
"that's a smart idea, pete conrad. get them out; have them ready ... you read them; i'll give them to him."
"okay. okay, it's on."
and i only got one comment jim's got for you.
yes. i think you're right. 05 23 40 26 i2_p-eva probably the large one at 12 o'clock.
how can you read me? you read me okay? good.
"these suits are bleeding down, too. see."
no. same as yours.
roger. the lm/cm delta-p is .5. - 0b 04 52 27 cc we copy.
"okay, there. *** still in low and locked. okay. that 's good."
better now and get it over with.
"(singing) i've been hammering [sic] on the rail- road, all - okay, tony, about halfway up the second one - it's getting a little harder, but it's going on in."
i heard it.
okay. let me ask one question before i read it back. i assume that i would be outsmarting myself if i went through the 90-degree roll in the verb 49 maneuver rather than going to zero roll. i'm looking for ways to kind of be stingy with the rcs.
"okay. every time you transmit, jack, the agc starts to drop off and the static level turns up."
"well, i did - you mean, the whole geological sugary?"
"wait a minute. wait, wait. i'm going to ... it."
yes.
roger. i copy. o0 23 o1 h6 cc and did you copy the waste-water request?
excellent. outstanding. 05 01 42 17 i_mp-eva good.

"houston, coremtech honeysuckle net 1. how do you read?"
"that's pretty good. pete, i'm going to move just a little bit further to the east - correction, to the north, so that i won't end up over in that hole to the side. okay?"
"okay, i'll turn it back on here, then. takes a lot longer to - depress the tunnel - to vent the tunnel - than it does in the simulator."
what's that?
and on. 04 11 37 36 i2mp and on.
"apollo 15, houston. over."
"okay; i'll come back to all these things. i'm gonna eat chow. 05 2b 17 49 cmp red filter. 05 2b 22 07 cmp boy, talk about being a creature of habit. look at everything right side up. day 7 06 00 59 h8 cmp ... reason not to wear this hat ... thing. okay, i want to go magazine papa papa."
"yes, we got it - we got it, john. and i copy the overlap and everything. if you had no overlap, i guess you'd have about 16 by 20."
"and i'm in accept,"
"there it is. 03 17 43 _0 c_[p now, there it is."
(clears throat) go back one picture.
"most of it is uphill fillets. most of it is pretty sharp. but my guess, from back at the lm, that those blocks on the massif were much more angular - i think is a good guess because that's what they look like to me here. lmp-e_a and looking up into our blue-gray outcrop area, t still have even more the impression that there's; a - a planier (?) orientation that dips off to the southeast - maybe just fracturing, but i - pretty clear up there, i think. it may - it may be shadows. 05 19 58 51 cdr-e_fa the lm is now 50 percent away from the massif - let's see, 50 percent of the massif heigth away from the massif. how's that? i think we will keep that on top."
"no, mine was lower than expected."
- - for the mains.
"and - okay. l, 2, 3 - minus."
really?
"... 09 01 3_ 58 lmp as soon as you get the 50 18, you hit the enter."
"okay, jim. we hear you here. and we want to start first with the plss being cleanly vertical. and then, your first step is plss aux water, open."
okay - -
"4, 3, 2, 1 -"
"okay, we're locked up at 23 miles and about 122 feet per second - 123."
"i24p is 11; soft stop, 51; max, 100."
roger. we're doing that right now.
"roger. thank you, 17."
yes.
"*** won't fit iffthere. *** in there and it's locked, *** and the dust cover is on."
"and the high gain antenna angles; change them from a ""-40 and 90"" to ""20 and 180."""
"oh! gee, what'd i do? try to get rid of them?"
"oh, i don't know. hey, bob, 55 yankee is an exotic-looking rock i found about 5 meters south cf the neutron flux hole. it's another gray - possibly gray basalt. it's just that there aren't many of them around here, and so i picked it up."
"okay, jim. how do you cycle those?"
"kitty hawk, houston. are you reading us now? 05 23 03 26 cmi° i'm reading you loud and elear_ houston."
"bob, the gray material that is adjacent to the red material is in at 5 - how would i say 510."
"what sh - what should our heading be down here now, charlie?"
... 98 and 70.
(laughter) i was just acting surprised; i really now _iaere they go. that's a little - we listen that way. _ they're not on yet.
"houston, 15. go ahead."
that's correct.
"roger. thank you. o1 o0 45 35 cml> it's really a fantastic sight through that sex- tant. a minute ago, during that auto maneuver, the reticle swept across the mediterranean. you could see all of north africa, absolutely clear; all of portugal, spain, southern france; all of italy, absolutely clear. just a beautiful sight."
how about an f/87
"okay. you're a pretty sight as we went into sunset back there. did you look down? we went right ever schroter's valley. 07 04 51 22 i_cp ... 0? 04 51 2!3 ci,p ..."

"most of the 70s are - are - are already exposed, with maybe like 10 frames remaining on each or something. and the 16s, i don't really know what their status is. we'd have to go through and look at each mag. it's my impression that most of them are only partially used. there's about four that i can think of offhand are empty. and we'll know all that as soon as we get out of the ship."
"yeah, hard .... let's try it, john, okay?"
it sure is.
okay. there you go. 06 21 13 51 lmp-i2{ get the click?
that ts affirmative.
let me get my seatbelt.
"okay, i'm going to close this vent now and turn it off so we won't get a master alarm."
"roger; 59 by 10.7. thank you, sir."
let me turn around this way.
"0k_y, i'm- -"
"and, falcon, this is houston. in a few minutes, while you're stowing the etb, we'd like for you to pick up the magazine and frame counts on the magazine from your two cameras, please."

(laughter) whee!
good show.
"houston, is that picture okay? all right, i'm going back to the sim bay."
"okay, babe. let's go do it."
"no, seriously. very interestingly, we can see on the map now that you're between guam and hawaii and a little bit north, and you're almost out 60 000 miles."
okay.
yes.
"wait a minute, is that it? is that it out there straight ahead?"
delta-v to normal.
"okay, got that."
"54, al's going to ..."

"good show. 06 02 54 58 imp-eva it's a little off vertical, but you're just going to have to take it."
"don't get me wrong. i think it's a good idea, joe. don't let everybody work all night on that one."
"- - just get my balance. bob, 556 *** the light- colorer inclusions in the blue-gray rock."
"okay, go ahead."
roger. we keep hoping.
roger.
helium press descent start is going to fire.
good.
(laughter)
okay; and i think we've practiced one of those once before. i think we'll be able to handle that.
"go ahead, al."
say again?
okay. we concur. we'd like you to press on and not worry about the vhf any more now.
"left hand ... okay, ... need to get out of here ..."
okay. the moon - i'd estimate it up around minus - somewhere 17 to minus 20 degrees lpd.
"orion, houston. did you load your dap before you started the p$0?"
okay. and - - cdr-i24 spillage out of it?
"be a good idea, mike. 0i 07 25 18 lmp houston, apollo 11. you got a cloud over the houston area right now?"

"- - very intensely fractured rocks. and it comes off in small flakes. let's get this one, because this will he the best oriented one for documenta- tion, plus why don't you get that one you've got inside there?"

"ron, while you're doing your maneuvering, no need to answer, but just a reminder. due to the - stop- ping your roll angle differently, you're under the ei refsmmat attitude, your roll will be about 046, and you'll see a max yaw of about 64 degrees during this gyro torquing."
"okay, ken. and g&c checklist now?"
that's affirmative.
roger. that agrees with our data. o1 02 56 1_ cdr 1.7 millimeters.
"starting a little high ... based on the ..., it will probably be double at first ***"
"yes, it does. i put it in there a minute ago."
as long as you're above the break in the slope; that's right.

about bravo 1. okay. here go - here goes the probe. pick a number you'd like to hear. how about papa l?
"okay. real good, fred. we copy."
will do.
or do you want to get up a little bit early?
that's all that was out there.
"copied. eight inches down, and what's the sample bag number on that?"
"okay. roger. understand based on a targeted (columbia) landing site; t1, 104 32 18; t2, 104 37 28, and 4 miles south."
"17, houston. do you read?"
"won't even break (laughter). that's pretty good glass, houston. can't even break it with our - -"
maybe - maybe not.
"it doesn't make any difference when we leave the earth. you can only get to earth in so many seconds every 24 hours. it's just like we had a 4-hour launch window for leaving earth, ... land ·.. sea...."

roger. 2.0.

that's 3.

it clears your head.
can i get mine in?

"okay, tony. that prissy precision young, was coming right straight down when he hit. we didn't move an inch on those footpads."
"okay, houston. the lm/cm delta-p is about 1. and, the cabin pressure being what it is, i guess that means that we really don't have any leakage up there much."
"roger, and the high-gain angles that you've got on the flight plan are close enough and should do it."
wonder why he wanted one. suppose we got the wrong time?
"okay, we'd l_ke to get the sep blankets opened, gene_ and dusted if they're dirty, so they can cool some more."
"negative, jim."
yeah. we can put it on ...

you want to - -

this doesn't push.

"okay, we'll get one, ed. stand by."
i know it. i'm just swinging free. cy&_ yes.
wondering if you can pick up the caution array there?
"well, we're sort of ahead, and expecting little things like that to pop up."
"that's what i've been trying to do, and i can't get any more -"
okay. give you a push.
"probably still outgassing. ail right, let her go for a while. let her go, still - still a little bit more."
"roger. i've just got time for maybe two sex- (columbia) tant marks, then get on with the final count."
yes.
"i'm ready, babe."
"that's good enough, john. clean off my rcu. that's the only other thing i wanted - can you clean the top of it off?"
until we're ready to sep.
"joe, can you also get us an idea about how far out we can expect to make it on the command module batteries."
it's on.
it's a 1202. (eagle ) o6 38 32 12o2. (eagle)
"okay, that's what i was thinking. see, it seems to be at the steep slope going up to it, but it looks like a bench or a little ridge on top. okay, we're at 354 at 3.6, and you ought to see that baby ray, tony. it's - it's got a real good raisedrim. you can see some good - it's got lots of blocks around it that are hard to estimate the size. and we are going up a steep, steep slope, john. i'll tell you."
the rake.
"and, joe, i'm in a position to get out. let me know what the final configuration is on the glycol pumps."
"bob, i hope you're keeping me honest on the flight plan. i got my head out the window. i can't follow the flight plan."
"ail those others been working ..., dick."
"yes. stand by. try not to look at me, and i'll clean you off. 06 00 49 38 i_p-eva can you point up?"
"okay, good. okay, my helmet coming off."
yes. no. i'm going to give them to all the hookers in titusville.
"roger. delete ""gamma ray, shield, off."" and a little further down there at about 266:15, delete that whole line where it refers to the ""gamma ray, gainstep, on,"" et cetera."
"ouch, my back. 04 23 43 12 lmp-_ okay. i can't tell."
m_rk. the ion source is going to standby.
nice way to wake up. maybe we'll just sleep in for a few more hours.
roger. we got it.
go ahead and take it.
okay. stand by right where you are.
thought you'd like that one.
"thank you, sir. we shall have one. okay."
"okay, if - les me just run it back through you _o m_e sure i go% them right."
roger. we copy all that. thank you much.
do you get the idea this thing rocks every once in a while?
it sure does. i can't say i understand it. but that's the way it appears right now.
okay.
"on page 8-12, change the time ""171 plus 28"" to ""175 plus 27."""
that's all right.
...
"okay. 17-1: 112:50:52, 55:42, 57:22, 58:10; north 02."

"okay. 06 03 58 53 ,lmp-eva hey, pan left, tony. thanks for reminding me, tony. i had forgotten it."
"yeah. well, the other thing is that they were goin_ to go down to ravine, and it looks to me li:_ezhe material at ravine is about the same material that'_ around north ray. if they get there and come up the way they're scheduled to, it looks like they're going to be on the same unit that they would have gotten down at ravine. 06 03 53 54 cm_ you really have to look at this stuff in all sun angses because you see different things fror: hou_ to hour. it's really amazing. how we doing on the pan camera?"
"just - just put a zero in front of all - the three torquing numbers. the - the platform is too good, and the numbers are so small, we - we're not even thinking in three digits anymore."
can you guys see the lm or are you down too far to see the lm?
yes. okay.
"you get over here. get over here, jack. f"
and this thing has got a barrelful of it.
...?
"yes, if we're going to sam - sample any blocks there on the rim, that'd be the place to do it."
"and i'm back on. okay; and we'd like your go, robert."
"okay, ron. we're ready for the hatch opening. the lock pin release knob, unlock."
okay. say the seconds again on the pdi.
understand. 800 psi on the ops. thank you.

see if we can find a reasonable path through here.
"rate scale, 25 degrees per second."
"okay. whenever you're ready, we'll - you - if you don't want to do it now, just holler."
"(laughter) i thought we were playing it by the checklist, geno. here's the bomb."
"houston, 15."
"oh, yes?"
"11, houston. your show is going out to the u.s. now. we're about to get the satellite up. it'll be transmitted to some other countries after that. over."
"i don't care what they say, hanging upside down - i don't - $ don't do so well. and we're sitting here at an awfully high sun angle, which makes the features very difficult to identify. but i have ansgarius located, and there's la perouse. and old la perouse looks like a - looks like an old langrenus with a big star in the center of it."

"and if you still have your pencil handy, why, the sleep came out to 7, 7 and a quarter, and 7. and the prds: 25026, 23182, and 08033. and go ahead with your updates."
okay.
"never know if it's drifting up, but we'll try it."
loud and clear.
"okay, jim, that concludes our powerdown pro- cedure, and we're waiting for you to get with it."
yes. time skip
roger.
okay. the cdr's reading 3.75. reading 76 on the 02 . i have no flags; i'm still in minimum flow; and i'm comfortable.
okay'. let's get another one.
verify suit pressure goes down to 4.5.
yes.
so we might as well do it. go to ... okay. next order of business is the tunnel.
okay.
"roger. because you're going to configure it here at los. and the word is on the - the high gain angles, believe your meter."
"roger, troops. while you're getting squared away there, regarding your question, dave, on the sep i unit, we think that you had some residual condensation in your hoses. and when you stood up, it ran down into the separator and water-logged it, causing it to go off the line. it'll drain - be draining, and we think the next time we try it out, it'll be okay. over."
"okay. plss - plss mode, both, to ar, tone-on."
- - to the left.
"you know, john, you need about two patches of velcro. it'd hold the whole thing. you got about 95 - there it comes."
"okay, ron."
"okay. at 4 psi differential, i'll close the direct 02 ."
"ken, i want to leave you alone now while you make this roll, but we had a ground station :failure on some of my transmission."
i got it. i'm sorry. i thought you weren't using it. i was just going to get this one over here.
stand by.
"no, the one you deployed. the rover high-gain - antenna."
watch the ...
sounds great.
"and we've dumped the data from the last couple of back-side revs and you sound real good, ron."
okey-doke. 74.
"okay, you're passing 14; 13. 08 23 56 &4 lmp i'm watching your pressure. it's confirming. cabin pressure's confirming."
- - i said you got everything.
"okay. ##* heavens! that means you got to get out of the way so i can open the hatch. iaip *#* i'm going to have to turn around a little, i think."
"apollo 11 cdr, this is houston. radio check. over."
roger.
"roger. gamma ray, gainstep, to center."
"okay. that's going in your collection bag as a single. and, i think you can remember it, joe. sorry about the bag; it just fell. i let it go. it's got slickensides on it."
"okay, thank you. you're coming in loud and clear."
- - foot track in the same - area.
"roger. 30:13, delete, and in fact, all the other items from here on out are deletes. and i'll go through them quickly. 30:13, delete battery charge a termination; 30:15, delete h2 purge line heaters, on; 30:18, delete exit g&n ptc; 30:23, delete - if sps mcc required and the references to pan and mapping cameras - the things, in fact, that you moved ahead; 30:35, delete h2 and 02 fuel cell purge and waste water dump; and, finally, 30:50, delete h2 purge line heaters, off. over."
"okay, i've got a stowage place for it, but it's kind of hard to get to right now."
ail right?
"it may have been thrown in here by an impact. oh, you're here."
"apollo 11, this is houston. over."
okay.
okay; copy that.
no. we can't watch them.
"yeah. we don't see any glass, though, particularly."
... really want ...
i found out it's right where the sequence camera points (laughter).
"i tell you, stu, that straight wall really is a hl_mmer out there."
that's correct. we're moving it back and recon- figuring for interior lighting.
thank you. 00 19 15 52 c_ okay. sm/ac power is coming on. mapping camera is going to standby; talkback's gray. pan mode is verified in standby. pan camera mode? yes. okay. pan camera is going to power - now. barber pole
"i will. okay, bag that one."
"yes, i saw that. i was going to wait until we got in a little closer. probably part of the separa- tion plane, i'm sure. okay, i'm going to turn the tv off here before i blast it into the sun on this titcharound, bruce."
two old compasses.
"actually, i'm sorry to hit you with all these, ken. i know it's a mess, but the pis are t_ying to recover as much sim bay science as they can, considering the changes in the overall flight plan. 06 21 10 43 cmi_ i understand that. go ahead."
"that came through loud and clear, al."
okay. let's do a verb 74 and get out of here.
you may be down-sun if you do.
"okay, go for pyro arm; go for pyro extraction - or hm extraction (laughter)."
"ckay, when you finish the burn, we'd like to get a radar check. i know that sounds a little late, hut we'd sure like to do it. we'll do a p76 after you finish your verb - and a verb 83 and get a radar lock, if that'd be all right. 04 01 23 56 cml= okay, we'll see how much i have to maneuver to get there."
"vance, joe brought up the alinement at ei minus 2 plus 30. were you going to send up or have a discussion about that later on."
"- - just behind the lm in that very fresh crater, i picked up an example of the kind of gabbro i was talking about. and i'll stick it in the big bag, except the big bag has disappeared."
"falling. it started at 3.65, and it's slowly coming down."
very good.
"no, go ahead. i just want to - -"
that's a good one.
211 for the lmp.
"well, where do you think we are_"
houston_ falson. ga.
"okay. and, gene, you might get the -"
"hey, you know what's bothering me?"
i don't know whether you understand all that or not. but - -
...
okay; we understand. 04 09 02 00 lmp-l_ sure y'all can get all that.
okay. we've all set.
"that's fine. just right there .... you up off the ground, huh?"
"okay, we're back into a - we're back into about a 5-percent rock cover as we cross the edge of the sherlock block field."
"that's affirmative. and then you'll do the - you'll do the purge line heaters, on, configure for the dump, and the rest of the things there."
"battery 5 is off/reset, and it's off the line. 04 !h 36 18 lmp-lm battery 6, off/reset, and it's off the line. inverter number 2 breaker is in. inverter 2. let me cheek the voltage. voltage is great. okay. keep going."
57:20? didn't they change that on us?
127.
"4, 3, 2, 1 -"
"roger. thank you, houston. apollo 15 air-_d-ground voice transcription 08 23 56 -- begin lunar rev 71"
okay.
okay. that ought to be interesting.
okay.
okay. 05 18 19 56 cm_) it's still just a flashing 5025 with a code 00062.
"okay. i'll improve, ron."
okay.
you got a gray.
"well, it doesn't mean - it means we didn't - they didn't get the data on the burn."
"roger. got it. oh that crater that you mentioned was a flow pattern, will you be sure and make a mark on your map on that, please? we're really interested in that."
that's gray and something else.
okay. hold on to that one. okay? and the other one will be number 2 with a tab.
right. did they see the beam leave the plates at all as i shook it there near the last of our third eva?
"the 65-percent blanket. and, john, we saw you get back and we started your clock."
our bias is good.
okay. hatch is closed. hatch is locked. okay. both dump valves are auto. that's verified. 04 11 13 51 imp-lm auto and locked.
"i do have a question. well, first of all i give you a little weather for the south pacific tomorrow, if you're interested."
"okay. caught that in time, anyway."
copy the mark - -
"very gently. and i'll even put - put the old girl downhill here, jim."
we is done.
okay. who's first?
yes.
yes.
"okay, we're about 12,000."
"okay, dave, i've got all the rock samples ***"
"let's go pitch minus 40 and yaw 90 on the high gain, please. (no comm for 23 minutes)"
yes. let me get you this bag.
copy that.
negative; we did not.
you mean tap on the thing that swings?
that's a little higher. see that shelf up there?
i think probably so. how late - how late can (eagle) you take a revision? *** three asterisks denote clipping of words and phrases. (goss net 1) tape 81/8
"... well, i don't really - part of that is - see, jim, ]-have the same problem that you have. i can't control pitch very well with my rhc - i have to use the thc and that was the control problem. no, i don't think that there's any control problem. i don't know why, because - well, you have to ...... you still have barber pole on the - on the ..."
"okay, we're starting to, i think, in a little bit, be able to show you the edge of the $erenitatis basin° it's moving a little slowly righv now. it looks like it's creeping over the horizon. cmfp it's going to creep over the horizon, maybe_ but i think - -"
"align imu, p52, same stars."
"yes, we're - we're on top."
"okay, ken. here's the plan. the g&c gives a hard- ware clean bill of health. so, i - they're going to smoke over the data now and look at why we got that little transient in there. in the meantime, it looks like we're safe to proceed with the flight plan. we'd like to pick it up at 267 - go into this sco x-1 attitude. and, since we're real fat on rcs fuel, we'd like to do the maneuvers between these different attitudes today where we're getting data in different - different attitude at a faster rate, a half degree per second. and if that's all right with you, then, we'll get the x-ray on now which is called for in the flight plan and then start maneuver into the sco x attitude and i guess we can use cmc for that."
pretty close.
okay. we'll work on this thing and see if we can't have it better when we get comm here in a rev and a half.
i'm going to set the tether right there and - -
"ooh - what the hell is he looking at, dick?"
"i bet it is. oo o0 49 34 _ see, the horizon is beginning to light up."
"what's that? the hammer? _p-eva yes, the handle."
okay; sounds like you did pretty good.
- - look to you?
now?
stick it in mine. i think we got plenty of room in mine.
"hey, leave me enough room to deploy the heat flow."
bulk sample is just being sealed.
"okay, close her up."
"houston, 14. how do you read?"
- - we'll say good bye.
"how do you read now, tony?"
"cabin gas return, egres_."
- - do you expect traveling on the mare.
"i had a beautiful view of the landing site going over, but i couldn't see anything."
(laughter) yes; probably.
it won't stay closed.
minus 60. 08 23 54 _9 lmp mark_ 90k.
"right, yes. okay. looks like the better way to go from here. up a little hill here, about 5 - oh, i'd say this must be a 5, 7 percent grade. the rover's going right up just like it knows what it's doing."
"okay, it says verify coremand telemetry. there's no way we can do that, is there?"
"okay, vance, how do you read the aquarius?"
"oh, the core cap covers. i'll get them."
okay. go ahead now.
"yes, more or less, a little far out, but i think - -"
"thmt view through this sextant is fantastic. i can see alaska right mp- right up alolg the lm, and i'm running the crosshairs right now down the coast of california, the west coast of mexico, yucatan peninsula, up amgund the gulf, florida, cuba, down central america, and i'm running into the stop right now, on the sextant."
what in the hell would you ...?
"houston, step 5 on 2-2 is complete."
okay. the systems test 1-a says zip.
"well, i guess - i guess the - the thing foremost in nv mind during those b days was how i was going to keep up with the time line and the flight plan, and how i was going to keep track of all the ex- _-_ periments we had going and where they were, and - and whether they were operating or not. and i guess that was a very, very fast b days for me. when i wasn't looking at the sim bay experiments, i was looking out a window and taking pictures, and it was a pre_tty cr-mmed 3 days. as a matter of fact, i - i guess i didn't really have - have much time to give any thoughts to being alone up there. ljage1490"
yeah. that one right there.
charlie's prd reads 21111 - 2 and four l's.
how's your signal now?
"cb sequence arm, two, open. o0 04 18 41 c2_p arm is open."
"okay. well, let's - yes, sir. let's press on. let's press on to this sequence until we get to am jett_ and see how it works."
okay.
"jim, houston. your comm got pretty garbled there just as you started to talk."
"you got them? 05 22 43 55 l_ yes. 05 22 h4 08 lmi_ okay. you're in att hold, going ags - 05 22 _4 10 cer acs. i will be. 05 22 44 1i lmp okay. which one are you going to burn first? it's nearly all x, right now. 05 22 h4 28 cdr oh, i wiped it out."
"mag m, m_n."
"casper, no need to acknowledge. your consumables look good, and, on the rcs, we're making a little money. we're about 188 pounds now above the rescue red line."
what?
"outstanding. ll o1 47 26 els tico, els. els has a visual."
and a reminder that that is a low bit rate command this time.
"goody, i've got a zodiacal light coming up there sometime; blue filter, no less. oh, i started to say, when i was cc_ing across aitken - of course aitken itself was down in the shadow, and the sun was really shining on window 3. i took the first one at f/5.6 and a 1/15, the second one 56, 5.6, i mean, at a - at a 1/30, and a third one at a 1/60, and then a fourth one at a 1/25, and she fifth and sixth ones i took off to the north - looking off to the north - out of window 4."
"a neat way to go scare up the fish, i guess. cml° (laughter) right."
"yes. time, 110:32:04.70."
okay. 06 03 30 04 cdr-ella i think the reference soil is back there at the soil sample.
"okay, houston. are we go for sim door jettison? over."
"oh, the other thing i was going to tell you was that magazine quebec quebec - i finished that one on ll4."
okay. shoot !
"let's see, maybe the - can you slide the - center the picture a little bit better? 10 03 13 43 _ yeah, why don't you all take the monitor over this way out of the - out of the field of view. which way you want it to - - 10 03 13 47 cml° that's really gonna be a good picture, isn't it?"
"0kay. let's see, ops actuator. disconnect rcus from pga. verify fan; everything off. disconnect rcu from plss. disconnect rcu from plss and stow on engine cover. okay. ready to go on?"
"okay; yes, ikarl. glad to hear it. ,"
okay -
jim?
how's the brightness of the picture you're receiving? you think we ought to open f-stop some as we approach the terminator?
"go ahead, llouston. (colu_z ia )"
how did landmark tracking turn out?
109. it's about il and minus 2.
"okay, falcon; houston. we need to reset - redes- ignate the rendezvous radar - to 180, 270 00 for thermal protection."
"and, jim, why don't you get off here, first - -"
how's your suit pressure? is it stable?
"okay. ob 17 17 b5 lma° i'm sorry, houston. i should have cued you on changing the sps pressure indicators. you want to see that again?"
"okay, fred. that's pretty nice looking picture. we'd like to know what settings you used to get that."
"i've got the core bag and the neutron flux, and -"
yes. you got it? i_(p i got it. let it come off.
what - what all is in the checklist to do between now and tonight? anything?
"hey, houston. tell chuck stahl [?] that attitude for the eva was outstanding."
"roger; copied. and, casper, the sim bay looks okay."
i didn't even see the alsep.
yeah. they're out from that - that little impact crater we just landed beyond. and i want to get this nice white one right here.
"all the way up is min, isn't it, houston?"
"no, that's - that's nell's special. you've got nell hutchinson to blame on that one."
... 0 and - -
"sure did. got good signal strength, houston? go ahead and start the etb up. i got - i'm going track mode to off."
sounds like you're reading us.
"cabin gas return, egress?"
"okay there, houston. i'm checking the ltc now."
the one we can't - we can't -
roger. how far are you from rcs power u_ - [_cs pressurization?
"well, *** swp over there. bowen is out here ahead of us."
"okay, on page 5-8. on the left-hand column, it says ""empty etb as follows."" we'd like to delete ""1 - hcex mag d and lcg compartment."""
okay.
"yes. see, you've got to go up - you're sitting - -"
okay.
(laughter) okay.
there you go. it worked.
"you remember that one, houston?"
i'll work on that.
that's the - deep trench - -
...
"i'll tell you, these teflon bags don't hold up too well in a vacuum. in a lunar environment, i'll put it that way."
and it appeared to me that the chamber pressure had dropped off just as we brought the second bank on.
"that's it, babe."
"it might work if we had to do it, fred. end of tkpe apollo 13 air-to-ground voice transcription tape ro)_/±,_"
"i couldn't see it ... on the picture, but - yeah, i think - -"
"okay, aquarius. the l_t pad i had for you right now is the lm jettison pad. similar to the - stand by 1, aquarius."
"(laughter) i was wondering if you would own up to that. hey, the good doctor over here says that your traces are flat lines. thought you ought to be aware of that."
sure is.
yeah.
"yes, all i've got's the monocular."
your photo path goes directly between peirce and pease - peiree bravo. and then leads up toward peirce charlie just a little bit north of peirce charlie.
"okay, bob, the src organic sample has been sealed. and the src lid is staying _lmost closed, about 2 or 3 inches open; if that's fine, i'd like to leave that."
"aquarius, houston. you're watching the middle gimbal there, aren't you? go ahead, aquarius."
"yes; well, i tell you, the - the traces on those up to the time that you turned off the gimbal motors were just a classic divergent curve, right out of the textbook."
"get my antenna, jim?"
"okay, that's nice to hear."
ail right.
"i think it - anyway, we sampled a soil sample there, and it is in the - it's in - it's in the box some- where. but i can't - i certainly can't remember whether it was a - white underneath or not."
you do? okay.
"roger. l, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10; 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. over."
"okay, that's our impression, too. thank you. that's - that's it for us on the questions. and for information, we're showing your cabin pressure is holding fairly steady even with both those demand regs on."
yes.
"bob, you want to try again. we're on the lcru. yes, we read you, but i'm on the lcru again. we're not reading you through the lm."
"fred, about one-quarter of our screen is light:,,d. and it's impossible to determine what you are looking at right now. maybe you could give us a little verbal description."
i mean 5 miles.
"okay. well, that's just what he's checking. thank you."
"there's a pretty one over there, without ar.y dust on it at all. out about 50 meters, by those v_ee little craters."
okay.
okay. 03 17 56 19 i24p ...
and that. ail done. okay. can i look at p307
"you really should set the flag up on a hill, charlie, but there just ain't one."
i don't save a hell of a lot of gas. that system was low when we started.
roger. go ahead.
"... down about - oh, i'd say - yes."
"you were hiding it from us - - cdr-_a yes, sir."
"helium temp, pressure, and manifold pressure."
can you see it?
roger.
"i'll tell you - you can - you caa use reel 2. about the only thing i can think of, jack, would be reel 2."
going to data. you got it.
"okay, jim. and then, finally when you're through with the housekeeping activities, clean the vacuum cleaner inlet screen with sticky tape. we think you'll probably find there are glass particles there which you can remove conveniently with the sticky tape."
"suggest maybe you just read off the circuit breakers you want us to power down. as you did yesterday, for us."
roger.
that - that looks like what we observe fr_n here.
"okay, bob."
okay. i'll make sure that gets to the backroom.
"okay, jim. in the lm, there we have - we show battery 3 only drawing about an amp, and we think it's probably time to get it off the line; bat- tery 3 to off/reset. over."
what?
"(laughter) oh, he did? well, they were pretty much sure those things were going to fall off anyhow,"
"okay, jack, that sounds great. i guess there's always a problem of getting the in-place, glass, if you think that's appropriate at this point. word along those lines, though, is we'd like your rover moving in 11 minutes; so it's probably not appropriate at this time on that."
"i sure hope i'm as clear to you as you are to us. you sound like you're just in the next room. it's really great comm. 06 14 25 50 c_p well, you are really - it's really great. 06 14 bo b6 cc ron, we're about ready to lose you, and at 161:30 you have a maneuver. we want to make sure that gets started on time because of sun problems on the camera."
they're armed.
roger. bravo 1 so it won't fire in the sim bay - -
"okay. track landmark 130 prime using p22, and for information, this will properly position your rendezvous radar transponder. ti is 122 plus 16 plus 05 - whoops, okay. stand by."
"dave and jim, houston."
"houston, are we go for dps vent?"
okay.
okay. we copy.
"hey, ed, you might tell fred haise he ought to quit working on running and start working on holding things in his hands - -"
"yes, let me check on that. i - there was some- thing on this when i left last night, but i'll have to get the latest here."
that is a good idea.
okay.
70 feet per second; we're coming down 36 - you'r_ still ... - -
"falcon, houston. you're go for landing."
ease out here. okay.
touche.
"houston, 11. roger."
... i
just a second.
yes.
back right where you were. step to the right. right there.
maybe the glancing sun is picking up the breaks in the icepack and giving it a different appearance.
okay. 00 02 39 50 aa ...
"yes, what's that chamber back to?"
you sure could.
"agreed, dave. we think the same thing here. a quick comment on your 16-millimeter film. we think that that camera, the dac, is still in good shape. that mag charlie was a bad magazine, and we think you can help us out on the other magazines left tomorrow by advancing the film with your finger just to make sure it's moving freely in the maga- zine before you clip it onto the camera itself."
116:42.
"roger. stand by, jack."
okay_
what's that flashing? 04 o1 4_ 10 cdr he's firing thrusters.
... minus 01170.
roger on that.
"yes. we had - i had a long boost ride, didn't we?"
carrying that rock again is going to be -
"al, you haven'z taken a pan, have you?"
okay. it worked.
ail done.
"roger. 03 12 13 h3 cdr gordy, can you tell us how far we are right now from the - from the moon?"
"got a little glass bead in it, john."
thank you.
"_ld that reminds me, did you get any information on the - that - what looked like a very strong, concentrated typhoon or hurricane in the south pacific between borneo and the philippines?"
yeah.
"okay. mtf- my small one-eighth inch - or one-eighth of an inch sided diamond joined with another one, now, _ld one side of the diamond is gone. i still have three sides of the diamond and the fourth side of the diamond, or the upper right-hand corner of the diamond, you might say, has disappeared and goes on with another little square - or rectangle. one - one end of the rectangle is about 3/16 of an inch long; the other two sides are about three-eights of an inch long."
whoa there.
"no, jack. it isn't changing color. i can't even tell - i can't even tell where it's coming up."
are you feeling the ullage?
"yes, your arm's in the way."
roger. fao's checking. this was the pi's request.
"yes. overhead dump valve close, and it is already."
i'm down that far already.
"you're fine, no problem; your option, geno."
"okay. and we have two general notes. one refers to sim door jett, and it's a reminder that we verify that the lexan shield is mounted in - window 5, with the cardboard shade off, for a photograph of the sim door jett. at - this is about 74 hours. 02 22 38 10 _ okay. i understand."
"okay. here we go, pete. 0hh, up they go, ..., one alsep. there it is."
let's see. you want - let's aee. you want ...?
"okay, and i'll do a better job of itemizing those switches. we were pressing pretty hard, and i'll - i'll be able to go back and get most of them, i think. and we'll keep an eye on it - on the master alarms."
"okay, we're now at - 35, maybe a little f/4, ... 206. we've passed mandel'shtam. we're going for - konstantinov - must be that guy."
"okay, 335 [sic]."
do we?
okay.
"okay. 1:45, 75 ... los at - ... 34 ieonfide )ay"
*** one here.
"okay. i just got used to the other attitude, and now i'm at a different attitude. (laughter) ... attitude, though."
"you didn't get an after, huh?"
one burn!
you know that's a mistake. you don't do that.
"yes, go auto."
sounds good.
okay.
"roger, pete, your cutoff looks nominal."
"now the thermal shield is on there, bob. i got them all on there."
"that's pretty good. tape 932,/20"
...
"yes, well, the whole thing is obviously a breccia. i'd sure like to get that - -"

"bob, i think your rake sample here at the sculptured hills is going to have to tell a tale combined with the observation that most of the blocks we saw were, like gene sampled, looked like subfloor gabbro. it's conceivable that the sculptured hills could be thesame kind of material. i think it's fairly clear that the boulder population does not resemble the massif population at all."

"i seem to be searching a little bit. you know, it looks like gain is creeping, not so straight yet, but it's gone up by about five-sixths; and the antenna position angles are pitch, minus 20, and yaw, 190."

"okay, understand."

"okay, now set both pitch and yaw knobs fully clockwise."
"endeavour, this is houston. on your rcs fuel, you are running roughly 6 percent below flight plan values, and you're still running roughly 15 percent above the redline. quad charlie is the lowest - the most critical quad. but, there's no big deal at the present time in any of them. quad charlie, incidentally, is l0 percent above the red."

"and, 16, we've got some national and local news here for you while you're finishing up with your chores there. the - first of all, ken mattingly made the headlines today in connection with the eva, and we got a big cartoon here showing the apollo 16 intercelestial hauling company coming back from the moon with a big load of rocks. looks like they've made a - a railroad car out of a sim bay here and got a big pile of rocks on it there. moon in the background, and all that sort of thing. got a couple of things here, one from vietnam. communist tanks drove retreating south vietnamese soldiers toward the provincial capital of kontum in the central highlands today, forcing government troops to abandon two more artillery bases in the town of dac to. seven bases in the central highlands have fallen to the communists since sunday. ten waves of b52s bombed commu- nist troop positions during the night in an effort to stop the offensive that appeared aimed at kontum. and from northern ireland, some guy found a new use for a baby carriage. he packed it with gelignite, which one of our backroom guys here tells me is a - an explosive, and bombed northern ireland's main telephone exchange during the night in a major attempt to disrupt the province's com- munications. the carriage exploded in a sheet of flames shortly before midnight monday outside the belfast telephone exchange, injuring two british soldiers and a civilian, and toppling part of the wall of the seven-story brown brick building. and the astros amazed everybody, i guess, by winning a - their seventh straight today. chicago's ron santo and houston's lee may bashed two-run homers for each side in the first inning, and then the two teams battled tenaciously without another score until john edwards smashed an llth inning home run that gave the houston team a 3-to-2 victory. that makes it seven in a row for the astros, and brought them a first-place tie with los angeles in the national league west, and gave them the best nine-game start, that's seven wins and two losses, in the team's 10-year history."
pin him down.
"okay, beautiful; outstanding."
"yes. and i can quite clearly trace out schroter's valley going off toward the northwest. i can't see it. it's a little bit out of range; it's north of track, and so it's somewhat out of range for me to see. _ 05 06 38 44 cc very good. hey. spence is asking me to remind you about the film magazine update if you have any time yet this rev."

understand.
"that's correct, ken. and as you can probably deduce from the noun 34, right at ]51:34, you should say ""start pitch rate."" and the attitude for that is ""221, 114 underlined slash 138, 000."""

"roger, jim. we have a question that may bear on this minor water problem. we're wondering if you can tell, or have a feel, for whether you're in a crater, or the slope of the spacecraft is, perhaps, caused by just a gentle slope of the lurain there. any feel for that?"
"well, all i can say, it might be appropriate, but it's not very musical."

"back when you had the tube on it, i - i really think - i knew we were looking in the right spot, but you know it was just blurry enough that - you couldn't be sure of exactly what you were looking at."
"you've got the sequence camera bracket and the ordeal, right?"
"say again, ron; we missed that."
"yes. they must be right in there. and i got your pan camera photo pad, whenever you're ready for it on 129. that's page 129. excuse me."

no. will that bother you getting in?
"the other way. i better get in the center couch - it's going to be tough - well, i guess you can stick it under my feet. well, we'll just do what you can. better shut this map."

"we would like for you to look at the end of that heat flow cable that was broken off and tell us how far from the heat central station it broke, and also describe the end of the broken cable - if you can get that in between when john's walking."
"okay, bob. you ... - -"
"okay, joe. we're all listening. go ahead."
"okay, jim. i think that's about all we have for you right now. whenever you feel like you don't have any more questions at the moment, we'd like you to reeonfigure for down voice backup and we'd like you to do that to move the voice function switch to downvoice baceqjp as usual, but instead of pulling the circuit breaker, we'd like you to throw the power amp switch to off."

"right. 0t 09 54 31 cmp but that's one of the things we reported and the plate that goes over the bungee fairing is cocked slightly. and now that we've got everything cleaaed out of the tunnel, i can look in here. it's real obvious that the bungee hasn't fired completely. it's down; the top of the bungee is recessed about a half of an inch down. it looks like it just hadn't triggered and, as a matter of fact, i'm looking at the latch and, by golly, i can see between the latch and the total ring, so it didn't even pull down against that. and i really obviously don't have any concern for it; except i'm - i've never seen one that looked just like this and i was gonna go ahead and recock it and fire it again and see how that worked with a manual trigger. but i got to thinking maybe that's - maybe it's best to let you folks think about it. the main thing i want to do is make sure it's not a problem in unlatching it when the time comes."
"houston, america."
you'll be at perilune in 15 minutes.
"i don't either, as a matter of fact."
"no, we just do that during the mission planning stages."

"that's affirmative, ken. go ahead."
"okay, tony, the rtg is fueled."

"it's a ""dave scott"" size."
that's what i was afraid of. okay. you've been looking at me since landing so we'll just stay right here.
"well, you can put a lot of - that old jack, john, just brought that core stem right out of there. sure wish we could have had that -"
"thank you. it's on, hank. 07 _:' 45 25 cc you're at attitude new, k(n."
i let that one slip by me when i got to talking to you about the landing site.

"challenger, houston. over."
i know sam ... screw him. not me.
"kind of interesting, jack. you slowed down, and then you're back up to 105 right now. now you're slowing down again."
okay ....
why?
"and, houston, how do you read aquarius?"
"yes. (laughter) no, that's - that's not from up here. at least i don't hear anything like that."
"oh. yes, sir. i tell you, if you learn how to use your instruments in this 1/6g, you take your time and you get around; it's frank phenomenal. but if you try and bend over without some help; not so phenomenal."

"that's the name of the game for the next 12 days, gang. put it back."
that's what i'm a looking for.
probably the best you're going to be able to do.

"you got to - got to - actually, all we need to do is get 500, do ..., get all that stuff in the bag, and we'll have everything there. if we don't, we're not going to get the film done. and we got to ..."

"not too full. that's all right. lmp-e_a - - intruded. huh? now, can you get that dike there? *** of it?"
are you wide open on the f-stop at this time?
roger.
very weak?
"you know all those rilles to the north of - i mean to the west of sulpicius gallus. there is a bunch of crisscrossing. one is right on the edge of the serenitatis basin - and i don't remember the name of that crater, i'll have to look it up later - but they've got slightly raised rims around the rilles. you can see some layering down inside the rille itself, in the east-west and the one that runs in the east-west direction."
"okay. locked. yes, and that one's locked and the bootie's on. that one's locked and the bootie's on. 06 19 06 53 i_4p-i_ okay. purge valve. --_ 06 19 06 54 cdr-i_ purge valve's locked, closed. 06 19 06 59 i_mp-lm water connector."

okay - -
roger. copy that. we're ready for you guys to move out.
"dave, you might want to bring the s - esc from under the seat."
"roger, intrepid."
"yes. so, you're starting out on the - you really want to hit about 29 - -"
"that's a good plan, ken."
"houston, 15. we've finished the photos, and a1 had the moon in the reflex part of the nikon all the way, so i'm sure the pointing was okay."
"i could be 100 percent out - wrong on that. but we sure drove over a lot of - in the regolith there in particular. the upper layer in regolith, which contained these - i mean the - the ejecta blanket - which contained - the upper layer in the ejecta blanket contained a lot of boulders with just their heads sticking through, and those were the ones i was looking at because i was trying to go around them. and they - and i don't ever re- member seeing a - a dark breec - breecialike rock in those boulders."
"okay, what do you want to work on next? top of a-2 says, ""isa decon bag."" de - isa decon bag, you got that?"

"al, you may be interested to know that dave is walking around on the lunar surface now."
"yes, i'm sure we will. and i guess the thing to talk about now is our reasoning, our thought processes on having you proceed at 5 seconds, and then having a1 throw on both the delta-v thrust switches right after that. and let me go through it, and let you think about it then. the reason we want to do that now, even though we do have a great deal of confidence in bank b, but the sps engine thrust light - we have no visibility into that system as long as that light is on. and, if for some reason, since we do have this suspect system here in a, we don't want to take the chance with b. and when that thing fires off, we want you to be on a good guidance. you won't have to do anything as far as your guidance is concerned. you can continue the burn, and press -- on even though it - it may have ignited prematurely. it does require procedure change, and i think you and al think about how you might handle this, and - and come back to us. but those are the reasons we did want to turn either delta-v thrust on earlier than the point where you'll get good g&n- guided burns."
okay. and there's to be no ullage. 03 09 55 36 @_ no ullage.

"and here again, i'll - this is not for you to write down unl - unless you want to, ken. it's a personal reminder that we talked about before, that, if you enter on that 204 display before going to scs, you have activated the - the relay."

okay. go ahead.
"you know, i keep going up to the top of the vehicle."
"okay, go ahead again there, guys. c_ okay, this is america. i can see a brieht s_et on the top of the south massif and - let me see - from the west you got the first hill or the first part of the mountains, then there's the valley, and then - there's a valley that k_nd of goes into a y - it's a y-looking valley. i _uess, if you come from the east, it's the second ridge from the east, and right on top of that ridye is a bright spot. i don't know how big - i dom't know how big a crater it should make."
yes. that's what i figured.
"now, i kind of suspect that we would get some attenuation of the - of the size in the atmosphere when you see a satellite go by. you weren't as bright. you're - you were bright, but you were very small. you were just like a star. 07 04 14 07 cnp i am very small."

"okay, are you through with.that?"
"on that last check, what did it look like?"
"it is the white index, is it not, that you're interested in comparing whether it's in the red or green?"
"okay. you might also at that point write in ""verify all command module vhf off."" i'm sure ron will understand what that mear,s. he's been doing it all along anyway."
- - we think you should be climbing - -
okay; keep going.
"i don't see how you can get used to it with all these bags, huh?"
did you get it?
"i'll have to admit, when you get up here - i always thought that el [?] was kind of a silly ... but when you get up here, it sure is different."

"a couple of special notes on the hardware. first of all, on - on the systems test meter - we don't fully understand why that switch did funny things for us, and we have some back in - the fairly ex- tensive tests going on down here still trying to understand it. and we suggest that you leave the meter in the 5-b position until we do get some handle on what happened there."
"orion, this is houston. is the csm above you or below you? we hope he's directly ahead. 04 04 3_ l_ cc roger."

"now i'm out of water, drinking water, that is. okay."
that's good news.
fifty cents?
and the rammer.
and that's ... - -
"okay. then, ken, after - after the midcourse 1 through p76, p35, and we're just about through with these. we'll have ""bmag mode, three, att i/rate 2 after maneuver."" and the next line is ""spacecraft control, scs, before optics, manual."" and that takes care of that page."
okay.
"okay, falcon, you're go for depress."
"limit cycle, on. 03 15 51 38 i24p it's on."

"okay; i'll tell you what, bob. i'll go ahead and hook up the pcm cable, and - and you tell me if you're getting a signal down there after i start taking pictures."
stand by. we'll watch it.
okay. thank you.
back on? yes.
does that secondary crater complex stand out in any special way that gives you some idea as to its origin?
copy that.
"- - .., it's gorgeous."
"okay, 50 18. proceed."
that's affirmative.
"well, i just hate to have anything lost."
"15, the surgeon says it's okay for the cdr and the"
"okay. and i suppose we're seeing as 100 percent full earth as we'll ever see; certainly as i've ever seen. it appears to be - it may be a little bit - a little bit of a terminator way out to the - well, to the east - out beyond australia and beyond india. but beyond that it's about 99 percent pure."
"that's all right. we can work in there. no, that's all right."
wonder if that's rudolph?
"hey, houston. by the way, you got tv picture down there."
"okay; copy ""35 oxidizer greater than fuel; 5 oxi- dizer less than fuel."" gl 00 34 14 cc okay. and the final part of that is in the ""tight constraints"" there in the box. it says ""greater than 160, and greater than 80."" we'd like to change that to ""greater than 168 oxidizer, and greater than 153 fuel."""
roger.
okay.
okay.
"right. incidentally, how many times did you cycle the switch on the deploy retract?"
roger.
that a boy.
okay.
"you don't have - well, take one off of mine and give it to me. i'll take it back to the rover. wa, wa, wa! watch it; you've got a wire under your foot."

okay. and 5b8 is another sample of that material - a little dustier.
okay.

"and we're in good shape on the time. we're back at the i_, and we got a lot of time to work with, so no problem."

"yes, i've got my foot right there. why don't you take a couple of cross-suns real quick? 06 02 07 54 i2mp-eva okay."
"stand by. 07 01 16 lh lmp-lm okay, ed. i'm ready to copy the ir ascent pad. 07 o1 16 17 oc okay; i don't have an ascent pad for you, but i have the lift-off time. it 's ltl: 37:22.36."
maybe that ratty data is me.
12:32 ...
okay ? ia_p-eva yes.
"what's that? well, it was just as good as it was when i was growing up - which means it was great. i grew up on those things, as i recall."
-- and stow on top of a-2 ...?
affirmative.
"and we all thank you. listen, if ed thanks me, that's enough. a man couldn't ask for any more than that. okay. i've got my ... - -"
okay. it's no big thing with me either way.
"no, it definitely cannot. because the rtg is perhaps a - a little south of and east, as far as the central station's concerned. 05 08 58 5b cc roger, we copy that. and, dave, could you call out to us the problem with your yo-yo. do you - and do you think it can be fixed?"
"good morning, america. this is houston."
okay.
"okay, fred. i have a few words for you on some things we want to do in the next few hours, and .....__ in order to get good comm for that and also in · order to give fido a few minutes of ranging, i want to have you put the power amplifier circuit breaker in panel 16 in, the voice function switch to voice, and ranging _jnction switch to ranging. over."
"*** got it 12 o'clock and around. well, shucks."
... still too ...
"houston, endeavour."
"about 5 degrees. now, i'll give you a hack at 02 plus 30."
okay. we're up on number 2 mi_course?
okay. let's take a -
twenty-six; comes up the right stars.
"okay. preliminary loi, sps/g&n. 66361; plus 1.21, minus 0.12; 088:54:22.71; minus 2798.8 plus 1045.7, minus 0037.3. all zeros; all zeros; all zeros; 0170.1, plus 0052.5; 2988.0, 6:38, 2981.7; 45, 252.1, 13.5. set stars are sirius and rigel; 122; 354; 000. no ullage. lm weight is 36312, and single-bank burn time is 06:51."
"casper, you're awful quiet."
"challenger, houston. you have a go for undocking and sep."
"reading you loud and clear, _ys."
"would you put the - you're loud and clear, dave. would you put the iu up tel to accept, please?"
"your bag is hung up, charlie."
"okay, a1 in the cabin, and plss feedwater, off. 0_ 22 23 13 lmp and - ar.d ed's feedwater is off. 0_ 22 23 17 cdr oh, .man, i can't get it off. 0_ 22 23 18 cc roger, ed. 02 22 23 19 _? you want me to get it?"
- - let us get behind ...
"okay, jack, this is the last time for the earth coming into view in about 1 or 2 minutes."
what? the secondary?
okay. i know the area. i'm not sure we're gonna have enough light to see down in there in the eva attitudes but we'll take a look at it.
"hey, that one looked like a piece of the gray rock, i think."
take it apart with -
"no, that's the same bunch."
"casper, if you still read, the surgeon says you got your heart rate up to 90 now."
"at 2500 feet, 52 degrees. *** dot is good. at 2000, h-dot is good. fuel is good. 1500 feet, ***4 degrees, gene. approaching 1000, approaching l ay5 1000 feet, 57 degrees. *** through 1000, and i'm checking - radar altitude and pgns altitudes agree. *** through 800 feet. *** dot's a little high."
"okay. let me just change the adapter up in _here. 05 22 26 35 i/4p stu - stu, we're going to buna plus 62.1, plus 0.1, plus 63.1."
"there it was, whatever it was."
"yes, the fender cut - dug under. see if you can straighten it out. okay. amp hours, 82 and 80."
"and we've got, ken, here some notes on this jet-on monitor emp. we'd like to do a check on it at 54:25, and i can read you up the procedure for that any t_ne you're ready to copy."
"america, houston. it'll be about 5 or 6 minutes until we finish the dump before we can go ahead with that verb 49, in case you got something to do."
okay; go.
"oh, rats' how'd you like that?"
yes.
..
"no, i don't either."
say again?
forget it. it's - it's just on local.
"thank you, stu."
"you know, houston, we must of caught up with every one of those partieles. because we're right in the middle of them. they're going kind of in a random fashion. most of them a_e drifting right along with us. some of them are going against us and away from us. but before we did the burn - you know, the propulsion, they got out of the vent. sent them all away from us in what looked like - in more or less the x-direction."
that's something again! (laughter) wheeel
"see, there's palmetto, too."
"okay. *** ought to put the sesc in there, huh? if there's room for it. where do you want the sesc, bob?"
i got it. 05 2b 30 11 cdr-eva i got it.
"okay. copy that. and, 17, our present plans from the back room are that we'd like to get the single core, the 500 millimeter shots - and, i guess, maybe one could do one, and one could do the other - and then we'd like to press on and do a short station 7, unless you think you have _ got a fair variety of rocks here. the feeling _ is to do that ... variety of rocks. i_4p-eva yes."
yes?
roger. we agree.
(chuckle) i can't read you right now. that doesn't ... too much.
etb's stowed.
"roger. you'll do a verb 21 noun 46 enter, 30000 enter."
"well, we're not through with you, gene, so don't throw yourself too far."
and my pga is going to start biting here if we don't get going.
okay.
"- - o. cml° yes, it ought to stable off there. it's to about 4.3 - 4.4 on mine now. houston, america. how do you read?"
minus 50 - -
you like auto? or reacq.
i'll put it right here. big rock.
"roger, gordo. we're ready to get the pyro arm and logics on now. 00 04 14 b4 cc stand by."
"okay, it sounds like you're probably just driving by the east trident or trident 3."
... 111 -
"okay; cb(16) ecs: lcg pump is open, and disconnect the lm water hose, and connect the plss water hose."
where?
"okay, 1456, 76747."
"okay; stay facing that way. pressure integrity check. suit shall not be maintained at elevated pressure greater than 5 minutes. okay; suit gas diverter, pull to egress. verify."
houston. okay. we just got some ... on orion.
i feel it already. feels good.
"verb 49, enter; auto; verb 25, enter; plus 00000, plus 00000, plus 00000; pro ...."
"yes. let me find you one. here, jimmer. right over here's one. i kick dust all over them so easy. how about that one right there? think we can get that in the bag?"
okay. that's entered.
"okay, ed'll give them to you. 05 23 02 43 i_(p stand by.. 05 23 02 47 oc say again, ed."
"well, i guess i'd better chlorinate the old water."
"okay, ron. we got 6 down here."
yes.
"yes, my - oh, your accessory bag is in there, i guess. the - the gloves."
"righto. if you didn't hear what i said before, i'd like to repeat that we'd like to have accept, and we'll send you up a state vector. and then we need to manually roll clockwise - -"
"hey, that lm makes a nice looking house."
"no, we aren't even above the clouds - we're still above the clouds."
"okay, we had a changeover from one site to another, down here. it was all on our end. no problem with your antenna. it's working well."
okay. i copy ...
okay. when you get - when you get up - okay. a press flag cleared on the commander. okay. the 02 flag did not clear. i'm at 3 - 8 - okay. 02 flag cleared on the commander.
okay. 00 o0 b4 5b lmp - - and that's - that's a thunderstorm.
i am already.
yes.
"yes, sir. okay."
"yes, you're doing fine. keep zooming, if you've ge left"
roger; looks good dowr_here.
"okay, looks like i could use a new state vector, i too ·"
okay. delta-v z is a minus 0009.8.
"okay. you might tell them though, i got my - if you want to check out the rendezvous radar i've got the transponder on."
how 's that ?
deep?
right.
okay.
sure are.
"okay, challenger; america. good luck on your pdi burn there. i'm going to track your landmark for you ·"
look at that l real pretty.
"no, sir. no, sir. primary loop checked out nor- really. secondary loop never checked out in yaw servo. the motor started normally, and it's - go ahead, hank. 04 02 16 56 cml° _at's affirmative. and i tried both auto and [_&te comm_nd in scs. 04 02 l? 00 cc orion_ this is houston. we would like you to go back to normal rcs confi_q_ration."
i know it.
the light is not out. it is not locked up unless the light goes out.
and we want to get a large block. why don't we - why don't we - -
...
we are not on vox.
"we going to burn, we come into daylight."
"you should have tv, bob."
"okay, casper, you can go ahead and turn the power on."
"and we want to leave it in data, of course."
"gordy, i might mention for future reference that we've established a new list of consumables, or at least added it to the old one. now includes gray tape and tissues."
"ron, this is houston. cml° yeah, go ahead, got."
"orion, will you confirm forward omni?"
"and i'll take my pan from here, so you - -"
that's okay.
"okay. you got cut out there. your ags delta-v , z confirm a negative and hotel, 109:18:45.00."
"roger. and after you guys give us the prd read- outs, we'd like to exchange the cmp and cdr prds because, dave, yours appears to be malfunctioning, and they'd like to have two working ones on the surface. do you copy?"
which way is down? (laughter)
"step 2, ""flood lights to all,"" but then scratch the next three lines. 07 23 22 31 i2,1p okay. 07 23 22 3h cc okay. page 2-2, i_nder stee is you ce__ scratch everything in parentheses. 07 23 22 44 l?,p okay."
"yes, that's quite a bang, joe. we've separated, and we've pitched around about 60 degrees now."
"no, i'll go ahead and wait until gordon takes it. wait a minute."
torque? i can't. how's that?
*** says.
"wait a minute - no, if you weren't so tall - and you - you are always saying - you just invariably stand so i have to get in a hole. okay. now let me tighten up your whole shooting match here. it's loose again. hang on. okay. between velcro and snaps, the world could never fall apart."
"*** which way it unlocks, though."
"loud and clear, geno."
"okay. pdi0 pad, when both vehicles are ready."
"40 degrees lpd, pete; 40 degrees."
i know i'm heads-down.
"okay, houston .... on ecs. cabin pressure may be high. i picked out a little pumping in the ecs system - in the hoses."
"okay. imu operate, close. 05 09 07 h9 lmp okay, vance. imu operate, close."
"okay, stow purse in isa which pocket?"
we've been dps-ing so ]cng here.
"we can see the lm umbilical connection quite well there, buzz. we see you zooming in on one of the decals now. it's, ""to reset, unlatch handle; latch behind grip and pull back two full strokes."" that's about all we can make out."
mark. okay.
ail right. okay. let me kick my shoes.
okay.
we couldn't tell how deep in you were.
"if you want to take a look at charlie - you want to take a ju - look at charlie, yeah, it'll clear it, but it's not any good, houston."
"let me tell you, bob, i've got to go cross-slope some of the time because the rover is really working to go uphill now."
"th_mk you, sir."
"okay, you should have 2 psi."
that's s~z_..._..zma_z·__e·.-_
"let's grab the surface here, charlie."
i sure will.
"there you go - up, up. somebody's - gotten to that little ..."
"coming down a little faster, houston."
okay.
okay.
"okay. if we - if we get this glitch in one of the other axes - i - and we have the controls enabled, i assume one of the things we would - we'd see would be some unusual thruster activity."
roger. very good.
okay. copy that. what - which one's on top? can you tell?
"okay, can i pick it up by its ... ? if i promise to be real careful with it?"
"oh, boy! okay. i'll take a pan."
"okay, thank you, sir. standby, stereo, power. you've got it."
"i'm still pretty depressed at this point. 05 23 _3 36 lmp-eva oh, man, john. this is really a ray; it just goes right in to south ray."
"mafk. another subtle one just below that, center right, right eye."
"okay. circuit breaker cabin repress, open."
you wouldn't believe all the particles we've got.
okay. copy on that.
or something.
roger.
roger. apollo 11.
yes. yes.
no problem. did you unplug your ekg blue lead?
"i just want to tell them i turned off the rear steering to see how she works with the front and it's really a lot better. the double ackerman's a little too responsive when you have the lack of traction, especially on the slopes."
149:02:56.
"okay, jack, we got transmitter and receiver both on, huh?"
"while you're raking. 06 21 54 00 i_mp-eva if you take it off, it'd be faster. 06 21 5_ 12 _ztp-eva okay. pick a spot. i'll rake."
roger; that's right.
"at 35:04:25. 05 15 06 ]0 cc aquarius, do you have a star close by there you could check?"
"all right, ken. i guess we don't have a grid right now."
okay.
"okay, dave. and if you think you can make this a 10-minute stop, we'll forego the tv. we're _-_ interested in keeping it pretty short."
"okay. completely delete number 2, and substitute instead the following: ""utility power, on; cover _ lens; dac, on 2 seconds."" change shutter to ""1/60;"" change frame rate to ""time."""
"well, that's what i was trying to do when i said we'd drunk all the juices and tea. plus, gene, in particular, takes water from the hose."
go ahead.
wilco. i was gonna try to let you take a look at the vector p40 before we got to los.
it's about zero.
"..., tipping it for you."
is that a good idea?
"yes, it could be some warmer. lmlp-lm off the peg. down off the peg."
"okay, 61, 64, and 48. and i have a p52 for you and a crew status report."
"houston, this is the roughest terrain to be plains i ever saw."
yes.
what lights?
"i think i did see the eastern tip of south america, now."
let me turn the numerics down a little bit.
"well, it's comforting to know that therets some sunlight out there. when we - when we - vented the cabin, some of the particles went out, and you could see the sunlight out on them. otherwise, it's just black as all get out."
don't walk over them._
"hank, before tomorrow, we'd like - well, right away, would - would you guys ask the suit people what we could do to get some lubrication into these wrist rings? john and mine are real tight_ and we're get - finding them very difficult to lock. over."
"and, al. be advised that your sextant star will - will be occulted at 101:16 - 7 minutes from now. and a gentle reminder, this is a single-bank, bank b burn. 04 05 09 2b cmp roger."
"okay, i just thought that you guys may have had some new ideas. we had a good briefing last night from gordy on the surface experiments. i guess we might want to be updated on the orbital experi- ments, if there's anything new. and field geology, i guess we got a pretty good feeling for it, but i thought they might have had some new ideas, or something along that line."
"yes. man, if there ever was a (chuckle) - i'm not going to say it. but if there ever was something that looked like a fumarole alteration, this is it."
okay.
real fine.
yeah.
go ahead.
roger. stand by on that for a second.
"vent. cabin's at .5, 1.0."
"i don't - bob, i don't let anything inhibit me - and i don't stay mad very long."
okay. and you want - -
"biggest one here. lmf-eva get her up. this is the blue-gray variety, houston."
"okay; off, please, eon."
roger; copy.
... (laughter) ...
rhc number 2 to armed. 01 06 33 42 ci_p number 2's armed.
"that's affirm. but, i got a 31:ll instead of 31:10."
copy alfa.
okay.
"while you're looking at the flight plan there, at 117:20 where that mapping camera stuff - just delete mapping camera, retract; and mapping cam- era, laser altimeter cover, closed at 117:15. cml° okay. delete mapping camera, retract; and mapping camera, laser altimeter, closed. okay."
the ... valve checks.
... i think you're about ready for bed.
"yes. so we cal_put them in decon' bags later, al. c nfidentia'l '"
okay.
wonder why it'll do that?
"jack, houston. we expect you'll need decrease throughout the whole burn. however, we'd like yom to control it as required, to keep it in the green band. _ okay. and _$_y do you expect that, oordy? missed one of the burns."
let's get them the antenna.
... circuit breaker was busted.
"hey, man. that's super."
jettison bag. ail items are clear of ascent stage. ready to close hatch?
"i'm reading 100 percent, houston."
"give me the water gun, pete, if you got any - a ' few moments, while we're talking about things. i could go for another grink."
yes.
ail righty.
"hello, houston; endeavour."
"just for another little matter of interest - once the earth is in the field of view, which it's about - looks like it must be about 12 degrees from regulus - it's so bright, that it blacks out any - blanks out the telescope for any star recog- nition. however, it worked real good in the sex- tant. you can see the star real well. you just have to assume it's regulus, though."
"i got 10 percent on the commander gage. 10, 9, 8, ullage, 6, 5, flashing 99, engines armed, 2, 1."
"go ahead, houston."
"when you did your p76, dick, with my burn in it, did you get any noun 49's afterwards, or did it come right up with a good state vector? 05 23 14 30 cml° no. i got a good one...."
that's a bad question.
"a1 and ed, this is houston. c:ver. oh 22 27 47 lmp go ahead, houston. 04 22 27 _8 cdr okay. plss 02 is off. oh 22 27 50 cc we request that you do not break your suit/plss integrity until we call you again. over. oh 22 27 59 lm1_ okay. i'm reading you through the *** co_lmander. 04 22 28 24 t_p yes. i read you. i read you. hear me? 0b 22 28 28 cdr yes. oh 22 28 -- i2_? *** minus 6, minus *** 04 22 28 -- cdr i can't - 04 22 28 34 i2_]? we're in cabin, yes. 04 22 28 -- cdr plus *** 77. *** 04 22 28 -- [2_p reset. okay, hold the ***, just a little. 04 22 28 -- cdr ***"
"roger there. we'll run down the temoeratures for the 2 nights. ((;(ll;n'e_"";i'i) page 580 07 05 59 50 cml' oh, it':; rio big thiag. ju:;t as a matt(:z' o1' interest."
go ahead. tape108/5
scissors floated out. hmm.
"i think so, too."
"aquarius, houston. over."
"okay, joe. understand. you want us to go ahead into plus-x p20 sim bay attitude, and pull in the mass spec and the gamm_ ray booms, and, i guess, turn off the mass - turn the mass spec to standby."
that 's all right.
"what ... we going to come on with it - - 03 15 29 02 cmzp that's interesting. it says burn time plus 1 second. and if the engine performs like it did the last time, it's going to shut down about - on time. that's too sh, burn not for us to n_ _ice it."
"that's affirmative, 16."
what time's ]los?
"and judging - judging from the way it's handling, i think the rear wheels are steering too."
"we're actually in a one-way relay. ron should be able to hear you, but not vice versa."
i got it.
"understand. 162:16 delete ""gamma ray gainstep, shield, on."""
- - got this stuff here coming up.
#** won't - get the sack there.
"yes, so far everything - particularly the zodiacal light and the gegenschein calibration and that sort of thing has been going just as per flight plan."
we don't even have the color.
...
"and casper, houston. i've got some flight plan changes for you."
"you might also be interested to know that, at least up to this point, we've eaten every morsel of food that was alloted for us at that time."
"... work that, charlie."
roger.
...
"hey, al? ... g,mma ray and alpha ray and ... all that stuff ..."
"yes, we didn't use any more than that."
"what are you learning, joe?"
and the gam}_aray boom is coming off -
roger. the correct number is 01614.
"houston, america. while ron is putting in the probe and getting the hatch back in, i'm going to go ahead and maneuver. how does that sound?"
"that's too much work, john."
"how did the tv look down there with ken outside? i was watching it on the monitor. it seemed like - in places it was too bright, and other places, not bright enough. and i guess that's the way the - i guess that's - unfortunately, that's the way the sunlight is up here."
"jim, is the battery light kind of flickering?"
you can line it up right there.
what makes you think we're standing still?
"we're all convinced you're right, john. thank you."
"station 9, vacant lot."
"okay, under other. comment 1: pad based on tei refs_at; 2, sextant star not available _ntil 200 hours get; single-bank burn time, 2 minutes 48 seconds; number 4, boresight star not available until 200:26:00."
i'll take a little right turn here. okay. came up all right; should be able to go down all right.
that sunrise?
what else did you shut off?
"well, we won't be able to talk to dumis again."
"i ain't either. i never have been impressed by the way those guys pick you out of the water. ?.',. 'i-a'l"
your right side. it was hung up on these ho - hoses. stand by.
yes.
okay. egress ?
turns out that they'll break. they're clods.
"i'll bet - i'll bet they - - 00 02 ll 19 cmp i didn't give you your pad for that thing, did i, al?"
and facing east. down - sun. and then we'll open the battery covers - -
"okay. in the rendezvous radar self - test and a verb 63, i have no shaft variation - on the noun 72. the trunnion's going about a half a cycle per second, but the shaft seems to be at 220 - although the crosspointers are moving."
"okay, i've got to get my hand over here. okay, i'm out of your way. cdr-_4 okay, and -"
roger. same old jim. we're about 0.7 mile out from casper now.
"hello, honeysuckle. 17's reading you loud and clear."
"(laughter) '03 l0 45 51 lmp wait until we get down in the ..., then we're ..."
...
180.
"yes, we're higher, even though we're slower; we'll probably be a little early. 03 1_ 28 lk lmp what are you coming up on, stu? okay. you - you're coming up on 111:20. 03 14 28 28 @_p we ought to ]deable tc see ... out there. we're _ast about north of it. you know, it's not as dark - the mare's not as dark as i expected it to be."
okay.
yeah.
okay. roll right 40.
let's make sure we get them before we go vox.
purge the fuel cells. 03 13 29 42 imp there's bound to be some somewhere - in the flight plan - ...
"yes, sir."
"say again, pete."
"maybe we ought to do the 0.9, charlie."
"okay, we copy."
szme of those near craters stick up in the way of _he far craters. mighty ]ow.
and cdr will be about 5 minutes after that.
"you're going right down u.s. 1, mike. (eagle )"
"well, going okay, karl. looks like i've caught up a little bit, got all the dumps out of the way, and got the libration photography. it looks like i'm going to be handicapped a little bit because of the mission timer, but we'll press on."
*** loud and clear. we're now watching the lmp.
okay ....
"okay, copy 9 - 90, 00, oolll."
"okay, copy that. we're ready to press on with alsep interconnect. and geno, how are you doing on that fender?"
"okay. you got your helmet on? verified your visors? verify the leva visors? okay, and we antifogged. okay. and the helmets and levas are under the cdr couch. stow loose items. verify all your loose items, gents."
say again.
"(laughter) it didn't leave much, did it? i'll tell you one thing - -"
all right .... warning lines. jim can pick up the checklist.
roger. 0mni delta.
get that s-ivb broke in.
h2 tank 3 fans to off; h2 tank 2 fans to on.
"okay, houston; we got a good sep."
"oh, it feels okay; sure the way to carry gear; it sure beats that thing. that's a pain. now, wait a minute; where are you shooting, al? i want you to shoot down in that crater right there."
"okay, bob, here are two rocks side by side, a meter or two in diameter. and one is the anorthositic gabbro_ if i can use the term; and the other is the - is that two-cycle breccia."
"sure can. 00 00 _0 33 cmp okay. well, ha ha. that's the way i wanted to start it. five balls. next thing on the agenda is that decal up there."
i got to go to transmit.
"oh, let's try it and see what happens."
"copy that. ia{p *** cover gloves, yes. we've also got the - we've also got the wrist dust - dust covers on too."
are those core tubes - they got anything in them?

"america, we're go for pyro ai_4."
"(laughter) hey, if you pull your helmet off, it's gonna go."
"houston, apollo 11. would you like high gain back?"
...
"yes. i got another view of that contact, and let's put that - let's put that on the northwest wall of cochise and dipping to the southeast."
that's affirmative.
"question 2: when the csm circularization burn could not be performed on schedule, did you think you wouldn't be able to land on the moon?"
"roger, gene."
"you two guys really know how to impress people, i'll tell you. 06 05 53 52 cdr-ir well, you know, we sure have a lot of good things going for us."
... normal and ... back.
think we got enough.
"yeah, and i could see - i could see all the way to the ground. just like flying the ltv - piece of cake."
no. how do you know?
okay. we'll be pressing on with the flight plan.
"oh, now we're coming up on a challenge."

okay. what was that temperature on battery 1 again?
"okay, good show. 06 05 33 23 i2_-eva okay, scb 3 is going to go up wi_h us, the src is going to go up with us, and i'm packing the etb now."

"gentlemen, we'd like to continue the press confer- ence in a few minutes. but, in the meantime, we'd be anxious to get - start - get one of you started on the lunar eclipse photos. we have three more questions. question - -"
okay.
here you go.
"okay, i can - -"
"didn't go as far, but went farther."
i got to go back in there.

"dave, a couple of comments here, and jim as well. we're going to be departing this sight for the closeout in about 30 minutes. so you're looking real good on the time, and we'll just pick up whatever we can. no rush on any of it. dave, you'll want to think a minute about where that treadle probably is."
"smile, charlie."

"okay, houston. verify high bit rate - and, ron, we need you in wide deadband attitude/hold."

"hey, are we recording on tape out there _ al?"
"just to review that sps pressure system - as near as i can make out, it's purely - we don't actually have a delta-p. it's just - of about more than 5 psi. what we do have is a gage difference. is that not correct?"
"*** it, don't they?"
yes.
"boy_ i tell you, houston, if we just had some air up there - here, we could plow this. 07 02 55 22 _v_-eva turn around, john."
"okay. i was looking over this transfer list - about 184:00, and i don't remember gene and jack leaving their helmet stowage bags back to me. so i think they must have them in the lm - in challenger."
"apollo 11, this is houston. will you confirm you're in omni bravo? over."
yes.
... vertical?
"it may work out that way. and, jim, you just could get the flag out; don't necessarily deploy it. we'll get that later when the tv's back at falcon. and keep me posted on your progress - -"
"look for yours, pal."
"no, let's don't. no, they're different places. 537, is a chip of the blue-gray rock; and the host - the blue-gray host rock - and let me get that other one -"
"we've been hoping all day - it's been off all day. we've been hoping that it would - since station 6 - we've been hoping that it would cool down so that we could get some more data, but it's not, obviously."

"okay, dave. '00 03 33 34 cdr yes .... ready to retract?"
"boy, sure did, didn't i!"
"it's driving me buggy; i just don't know what i'm going to see when i pitch over. take a look and i'm going to say, ""ahhhhhhhx there it is!"" i'm going to say, ""oh, freeze it!"" i don't recognize nothing (laughter). then, i'm in deep yogurt. then, if i dgn't_recognize anything, i'm just going to let it keep going. that's the best i can do."
"okay, we copy."
"okay, give it time to clean the flute."
"okay. when you get on, jack, you can give me a frame count as you start moving."
"... the old jett bag in the way here. okay, tv is going up to tv."
watch it; the edge of that crater is - drops - -
(clears throat)
on as required to pressurize.
- - pallet.
okay; we're on the capture latches.
"okay, 730, 1153 - not too bad. plus 135, we're descending a little faster than normal, and we're a little bit low."
we've got to go around this - -
"apollo 11, houston. vhf check on simplex alfa. over."
"well, i tell you, this place is so fascinating that you just - you jut don't dare let anything go by. it's - you know, i think you could stay here a lifetime, and never see it all. i guess that's - that's kind of a silly statement because it's true in almost anywhere you go. it sure is dramatic. at first glance, particularly the back side looks like an old gypsum plant. it just looks like someone's poured stuff all over it, and just made it - and just tried to hide it, camouflage things. the more you look at it, then you start to pick out subtle differences. un- fortunately, i'm not smart enough to know what these things mean, but i'm sure that we got some folks down there that certainly do. maybe if we get enough data, why, they can piece it together."
think it ...
- - keeping above the hub here.
"right, the mode change worked."
"okay, go ahead."
"okay, we copy that, endeavour. you can go ahead and power it down. we've run through to the last of the pan camera film."
"what - well, bob, i guess - remind us to change the lrv sampler at the next station. it's almost out of bags."
yes.
watch out for that new ground there looks like in %he - look at the italian flag.
okay. you want the dac on when it starts heating up.
okay. i can cut it out with a high squelch on bravo.
roger. like advertised.
frame count awhile back and i believe it was 5. that was at the sep.
"(laughter) yes, that's just exactly what it feels like too."
we've already gone through this.
i know. i don't even want to think about it.
ail right.
"- - desk set up here at capcom, so if at any time we want to break down any relay at all and go back to split loop_ we can do it, no problem."
"oh, shit ..."
huh?
okay. here we go.
this is a kind of one-sided discussion. i wish i was there so i could take a more active part.
ail set.
it is.
yep. it's altered in the flight plan.
"okay, fine. and, john, if you have a minute there, you might consider attaching a lanyard to your apple [sic] on the third key and attaching the lanyard to one of the fittings on the front of the suit so that if that pin - or that key comes out, you won't have to go looking for it."
"()kay,we'll check."
yes. right. okay.
"16, hcuston through aria 3 now. burn time as pre- dicted, 5:43. everything looks good. tape2/8"
you got it? okay. that's beautiful.
"pese, we go to stop charging bat a now?"
bravo 4 and keep count of how many times you blow off the dust.
okay.
"ail right. we'd like to correct one of the short -- burn constants, and it's in coll_mn d, row 5. the number should be changed from i - 01605 - it should be changed to 01614."
roger. you copy my noun 93?
"well, ..."
roger-roger. option 3.
look at the ball.
"cmc in auto. yes, clock's running to rrt. yes, it is."
"okay, houston. you have the eomouter."
"no - yes, it's on backup again. i'll put it down for you. okay .... get it to me?"
i'm hal_ay between.
okay.
"okay, i guess i had better get goin6 on that. let's see, letts - okay, the magazine bravo bravo is down to - 50 percent."
"might if i fold them in half. 0b 0__h2 32 i_mp _,_t_'c_kt-h'em into the i3a then. oh 03 42 hl cdr there we go. oh 03 h2 51 cdr i'd hate for any of that stuff to get loose in zero gravity. it would be a mess."
"gosh, i sure wish we had more time to sample."
"okay, i'm looking it out - looking at it out the center window - the hatch window - and i'll give you a hack when it crosses the xx axis at the center window; and i guess it's up maybe 45 degrees."
"hey, you know, i haven't - hadn't gotten around to looking for planets. that's what i was doing the other night when - when things went to worms, and i decided they're probably trying to tell me something. it really is pretty out there, the way you can see all those stars. they - they really stand out. looks like a planetarium, there's so many."
?nat's what i said. 06 06 00 06 l_-lm i'm sorry.
okay.
"now, which way are we doing it? 04 07'42 56 lmp put orange to orange on both. see, now, that one clamp has a little orange-to-orange dot and then the circular has an orange-to-orange dot. the best thing to do is take it over by the window because, otherwise, you'll never guess it in a million years. stick this thine in the hole and you've got - -"
"okay,"
... stablize binocs.
"go to landing. 04 00 3h oh cdr-lm radar test to laitding; power signal light, out. 24 o0 34 07 li,_p-lm okay, jim, houston on the steerable, i mean - listen at me - orion on the steerable. how dc you read? over. 04 o0 3h __ cc _._n, we read you much bette_. oh 00 34 18 lmp-lm okay, it worked that time, jim; we got a a.2 signal strength, and the steerable is working, i'm in track mode? auto. 04 00 3h 25 cc very good. i have some words for you on the ros."
"/ you might be interested in knowing, mike, that / we have gotten reflections back from the laser reflector ray they deployed, and we may be able to get some information out of that a little later."
"well, that's my question. we're not - our 16 20 doesn't match our eight-ball here. we went to fdais on, and we don't have our balls completely powered up. there may be a ... and our angles don't look the same and we don't want to go into gimbal lock. tap_' 3!_/l{ pag_ 18c_"
okay.
sure hope this thing comes up. and there it is.
"okay, copy that, jack - gene. ia{p-eva okay, what was it - where did they want it deployed?"
##* my legs? am i getting out?
"apollo 14, this is houston. you're go for the docking."
roger. inboard. bermuda (rev 1)
"roger, gene. sure be nice to have that on tv, wouldn't it?"
"what ain't stopping, ken?"
ready.
"okay, joe. i'll tell you, i'm just trying to figure out where we are here."
okay.
"okay, lima lima is on 161. i don't know how many's left. it says 160 on it, still going, but -"
"falcon, houston. you're looking good at 3 minutes. 07 03 40 25 cdr-in okay .... 07 03 40 30 cdr-i/4 roger. the only thing unusual i noticed is the rcs oxidizer manifold pressure oscillates every time the jets fire. that's backing up to the ..."
yes. we just drop it in here.
all right. coming out again.
can't even read the rover.
"oh, we're all right."
"okay. panel 3: batter{ chat_(:e, off - you've already done that, jack - next ac inverti{n, inverter 2 off: panel 5: main bus tie bat b/c to bat b/c. huh? yes, it's up - the up posit_on. pane] 250: circuit bre,_ker, bat a power entry/ postlandin(; lo open; circuit breaker_ bat b fowiin entry/posti,andin(], open, panel 5: cb b%tteny cttai{ger b/vi'i3 charon, once. 0b'_y. i '11 let, you read that back, jack."
"go ahead, houston."
endeavour's ready.
sure.
"asld,jack, how do you _ead?"
"okay, jack, get that cable, because i tripped over it coming back."
okay.
"ken, there's one other comment here. if you are gonna, at some point in lunar orbit, do quite a bit of optics switching, like manual and automatic and that sort of thing, we would suggest in that case that you load emp 509 before you start playing with the optics and take it out again when you're finished."
yes. delta and echo coming in.
"roger, houston. understand that and - one point from here, karl - i'm over the spot in imbrium, i think, close to where you and whitiker drew from or figured out, some lava flows coming out of where the wrinkle ridge is, and at this low sun angle, i can very clearly see some lava flows coming out of what appears to be a ridge, extending in both di- rections from the ridge. and i wasn't set up this _-_ time to take a picture of it, but it might be in- teresting on the next pass if we could get a - if we could get a pad to take a picture of that."
okay.
***hand tool carrier.
the tvc enable relay?
okay.
very good.
"question number 8, again for ken: what were your impressions of the back side of the moon, and were there any surprises?"
"now, you've got it."
"no, we don't need that in a padded bag. 06 01 h8 54 cdr-eva it's about 6 centimeters - 12 centimeters long, and it's got a head on it like - it looks like the head of a - maybe a viper or diamondback, if you lay it down flat. you won't have any trouble recognizing it. and it's white, and when i hold it up to the sun, it has a greenish cast to it. a greenish-bluish cast."
question 15 for john: what did you mean when you said morale went up a couple of hundred percent after that successful tei? was it low? 10 03 42 34 cml° (laughter) was your morale low before tei?
"and except, maybe, for the area just - well, no - even there, i didn't the ... - it looks like the whole visible continent is clear of clouds this morning. possibly some clouds just east of the ross sea, which is just coming into view, i think."
"yes, i do too. very interesting. i thought that was only on the back side. i guess that's a vhf thing."
roger.
yeah.
"america; omni delta, please."
"yes, sir. i'll even move left. hjw's that? we got 60 percent left .... i like t_ fly."
"yeah, we tried to give you a call, but we had our comm drop out just about that time."
"okay, go ahead. any other words."
okay.
"auto, on."
roger.
"i'm about as iow as you can go, joe. i'm sitting on 4.4."
- - your eyes off the road there for a moment.
that's got to be some kind of record.
okay. stand by. get tv. okay. what do you want to do to the sep?
"okay. and ! got you a p52 on the last pass if that'll help. and i used starts 27 and 31, and the torquing angles were plus 0.108, plus 0.061, plus 0.001, and i torqued that at time 170:59:30."
"hey, ron. you got a 110 heart rate. what are you doing? cml° (laughter) shaking the couch."

"in fact, you know what it looks like here, it looks like it may be this darker material - well, i don't know - -"
"hey, great!"
mark lmp. again it was a streak; it was - appeared to be in both eyes; moving from i o'clock toward the center; intensity 3.
and i'm checking out the cosmic ray. cosmic ray looks good.
"this is houston. we copy, and right toward the end of your transmission after you mentioned lighted horizon, you trailed off down into the noise level, neil. over. 04 12 15 07 cdp_ okay. (t_q)"
i bet you're right.
"you'd better believe it. yeah, did we - would - would we still be in lunar orbit? 10 o0 41 59 ia_ no, we'd be on the way home - -"
"okay. we'll do that, and that'll get us back on time. and we're looking at a 6h-degree angle now, so 4 more isn't going to be that different."
"eds power, off."
"okay. how much time have we got, houston?"
i can't get out of - - = d yl o0 00 29 39 cml° i guess i'd better get on with that p52.
"okay, joe. you were saying something there about 252:30, as we lost cow,,. i got the entry at 252:00. was there any change at 252:30?"
"and the - the surface is fine a_d powdery. i (tr_i_'q) can = i can pick it _p loosely with nt_-toe. it does adhere in fine layers 2likepowdered charcoal to the sole and sides of my boots. i only go in a small fraction of em inch, maybe an eighth of an inch, but i can see the footprints of my boots and the treads in the fine, sandy particles. 0h 13 25 30 cc neil, this is houston. we're copying."

"okay, first of all the weather. it's raining fairly - fairly heavily all night; there's a lot of water standing around. temperatures here are in the high 50's, but it's supposed to get a little cooler tonight with a low in the 40's. i think you know how the dallas-redskin game came out - the only thing additional mentioned here is that chances look good now that washington and dallas may meet in the rubber games for the national conference representative in the superbowl. in the other pro game yesterday, a field goal by don cockroft was the difference in a 26-to-24 win by cleveland over rival cincinnati. other sports highlights: the pittsburgh steelers play the oilers today in the dome. other big games will be atlanta at san francisco, green bay at minnesota, and baltimore at kansas city. tennessee state beat drake uni- versity in the pioneer bowl 29 to 7. and east texas state beat carson newman in the naia football playoffs. the southwest conference has pulled out of the u.s. olympic committee. some college basketball scores: the houston cougars routed xavier last night out at hofheinz pavilion ll4 to 7b; and rice downed george washington 93 to 89. geno, you'll be glad to hear purdue ripped tcu 101 to 70, and it was texas over oklahoma state 86 to 66. and smu over oklahoma city 106 to 8b. we couldn't find any score at cal tech, jack, but - switch to omni bravo, please. but one final score, ron, kansas lost to iowa 69 to 56. the only thing new on the plane crash friday in chicago - it's reported here that the plane was apparently waved off because another plane was still on the assigned _ runway. the democratic party's stormy session in washington saw the old-guard democrats appar- ently take back control of the party from pro- mcgovern forces. mrs. jean westwood was replaced as party chairman by texas lawyer/businessman robert strauss. former-president t_mau appears to be more than holding his own at a hospital in kansas city. there's a good chance the 88-year- old former chief executive may be taken off the critical list. there's been a 1-day interruption in the secret peace talks between dr. henry kissinger and le duc tho. the two conferred for over 3 hours yesterday. both sides have agreed not to talk to newsmen on any s_stantive matters. in other news highlights, president nixon has named daniel moynihan as u.s. ambata -ambassador to india. and chilean president allende has flown to cuba to vis - to visit fidel castro. here's an interesting one. a 45-year-old pilot lost in the arctic for 31 days has been found alive and well. three companions were killed. the soviet party boss leonid breshnev has delayed a scheduled visit to the u.s. it looks as if the visit may come in the fall rather than this coming spring. one last note: the news media says that the flight of apollo 17 is the smoothest on record so far, and i call that last one pretty accurate reporting. over."
"okay, al; and we will need marks on them, of course."
"160 feet a second, huh?"
"we had tei, ... at p30. that's a tough one."
"yes, i will give you a reading on that before long. i wouldn't eliminate station 8 for the world - or the moon, whatever's available today."
"al, this is houston."
"okay. flug is out. my end's red now, but that's all you can get it out."
"make sure you ... 08 02 26 20 cizp use those little square jobbies, you mean - we have around. yes."

"we did. we closed the waste management vent valve, there. or waste stowage valves - -"
"well, i couldn't see it."
"fred, if you're going to give me any words on the antenna operation, i'd appreciate them very soon."
"roger. and, while you've got the flight plan there, the only update that concerns us for the next hour and a half - is to - over there at 21:54, delete mrnual - ""manually roll clockwise."" you got that one? 08 19 30 56 cml° yes. roger."
"and, houston; america. on mag yankee yankee used frames 31 through 35 at that last near-side termin- ator there."

"press alarm, on; tone on."
you're loud and clear.

"okay, get the - delta-vs now - i mean, delta-v, 20."
"okay, gordo, how do you read cdr on vox?"
"okay, there should be a scarp around there some- place."
"okay, that first one is three ones = 02."
"roger. everything seems okay now. it was very brief, but we lost it for awhile."
"okay. copy that, geno. and we're ready for you guys to go on at your earliest convenience."
"well, i don't know how large large is anymore. 06 02 58 24 i_p-eva yes."
okay.

"this is not unlike all the other rocks around here, houston. all the rocks are just about -"
"gee, that's interesting, joe. it's - you sh - i guess it completely went off, and just didn't get hung up somewhere, huh?"
"i went - i raked about a 2-meter square area - _ _ maybe - yes, about 2 meters, and down to _ or 5 centimeters for these. pretty good population. they a11 going to go in?"

okay.
"could you say the voids again on - ken? 00 23 27 36 i_mp one was timed 41 - 41 seconds; the other one was lost due to a malfunctioning bag. and we got on me now - for my meals, i had the sandwich and the orange juice that was in the suit. for meal c, i had half the spaghetti, all the ambrosia, and the cocoa. my prd is 21040. i got about 5 hours sleep; got two voids of 20 and 25 with about a 20-ounce fluid intake. over."

"and, a1 and ed, do you have the rim in sight at this time?"
"houston, clipper."

"okay. where's your core tubes at, charlie?"
"this is - *** that foliation i mentioned does not go all the way through the rock. there are varia- , tions in texture. one zone was strongly foliated. there's another - it almost looks like a large - it is - a large inclusion of nonvesicular rock within the vesicular rock. there may be some auto- brecciation involved in the formation of this ; thing. it really looks mineralogically like the *** colored samples from the south massif. but i - i tell you, that's only because it's light colored, and i - i can't give you anymore than that right now, until we get a fresh surface."

what do you want me to do?
"apollo 11, houston. based on our sighting since the midcourse, we're showing a g_mma of minus 6.57. this is preliminary, though, and we think that after some more tracking it should como on in, and we could tweak it right on into the corridor. it's just about in the center of th_ corridor; everything's looking fine. we'll have you an entry pad in a couple of hours before you go to sleep. and from our friends in _ublic affairs, a few headlines, other than your flight. you're still dominating the news. hc ever, there are some other things of interest f _ ou. as mentioned earlier, the ail star g_ae was rained out. it's going to be played tomorrow. however, president nixon will not be aole to see it as he planned. we'll keep you posted on results. and, also, the weathermen are going to be good to you. our forecast is, iooks like it's holding good for the recovery area; it should be real fine out there. presi- den!,nixon, as he prepares to fly out to greet (_;r/_;nmt ]) tape 1.01/-4 pr_,a.55) your returrl, predicted that within 31 years man will have visited at least one other planet bearing some form of life.

"... all of the bubbles have disappeared, except two."
"eagle, houston. middle gimbal. and you might pass to columbia, we don't have him yet."
"yeah, there's a piece."
"intrepid, houston. go low bit rate."
"roger, dave. looking forward to it."
... pole - three.
they didn't do that. 0_ 22 32 43 cmp i thought that's why we picked these kind of people throughout the program - was people that understood how to operate as opposed to how to have meetings. but it's been a - this has looked more like a - an operational data priority than a -
"i just want to hear you say it because i'm going to hold you to it. as long as you shadow your eyes from the sun - the sun is just about laying on the horizon of the moon, and as a matter of fact, as i watch it, i can watch the horizon - the amount of - of daylight terminator get larger."
"and that - and that orange band is about a meter wide, i think."
copy that.
we'd like you to cycle the pqgs switch off and then back on.
okay. power off.

"well, - we're not - we were speaking of the merits of the sunrise."

"ooooh. that's verified, ron."
"okay. okay, karl. stand by 1."
"... make your darned landing, now. okay?"
"hey, - houston, with the attitude of the rover, i'm having a tough time finding the earth in the - in the field of view because of the sun shining in my eyes. this is only going to be a short stop. do you think you can do without it here?"
"roger. lm ascent lift-off time: 124 22 0000. your csi tig, say again csi tig: 125 19 3470. your tig of tpi: 126 57 0000. and the lm's noun 81 values for csi: 0532 - that's 53.2 for delta vx, delta vy all zeros. columbia, houston. over."
okay.

i don't. doesn't look like we'll get to use it.
yes.

okay.

"okay. okay, we're ready to copy."
"yeah, let's all take a drink of water. 00 o1 49 32 cml° here. i'll put the binoes up."
"okay. that sounds good. we'd like you to return to the surface gravimeter, jack. what you did had some effect, but not - not a lasting effect. and we'd like you to rap even more sharply, more strongly on the gimbal another three times. and we're again watching it, and we'll let you know what to do. and - i might tell you that this has all been done recently this afternoon up at bendix on the qual unit, and it survived it and so we aren't in any real danger apparently of destroying it. l_-eva okay. three times, huh?"
"right. there's a ... you better jump. no, no, that's not noun 81."
okay.
okay. coming down.
think that's only way they can hear you.
"okay,"
"it's sort of caked on the top, though. yes. another black matrix%fine-grained with white clast - millimeter size - and there are some very fine grained little sparkles in there, though.."
alpha/x-ray - -
go.
"okay, i show you at 1.52 or something like that."
"okay, i agree."
says you're going to be doing this - coming around in here.
"okay. beneath ""cb sps pitch l, yaw l, open,"" insert ""cb sps pilot valve main b, open."""
"ron, we did not get the high gain to narrow. we have sequence £or you which is important to go through so that we do not break lock and lose this lunar sounder vhf data. we would like you to dial in pitch, minus 45_ yaw 5. go to manual and wide. and when you get the signal strength, go to reacq and then step to the beam, narrow, medium_ and wide, or_ say again, wide_ narrow, medium."
"yes, it sure would. y)u don't realize how cold this thing becomes when it's in a ptc mode that's slowing down, and i just clocked the cycles on my ... and it's about 11 to 12 minutes now, and the sun is directly overhead, so it's shining on the engine bell of the service module and not getting down to the spacecraft at all. 05 ]2 54 ]6 f hang in there. it won't be long now."
"okay. number i is, inspect the general area this is sort of a general point of view inspect the general area around the v over h sensor and comment on any evidence of thermal or mechanical degradation. and 2, 3, 4, and 5 are sort of more specifically. number 2. is there any evidence of v over h sensor lens cracking, or debris on the lens? in other words, have a good check of the lens itself. num- ber 3. is any large amount of the black paint around the v over h sensor opening missing? number 4. is the plume shield in place around the v over h sen- sor opening? and the plume shield is what i'd gen- erally call the - or - the - it's the guard around - the lens sticking out about 3 inches there. and, number 5. is anything obviously obstructing the v over h sensor field of view?"
okay. 00 02 01 17 imp do you want to hold off on the power until carnarvon los?
"alfredo, it's looking like wake-up time."
"that's the only fallacy. they're not even watching this. come over here and watch me, ed. oh, me. let me have it."
roger. we're go for midcourse number 7.
"what are you doing, watching the .... dick?"
"can you tell if i'm going to - maybe i put that in the wrong direction, although i'm sure that that was the right - south is to your left, isn't it? okay, we're going the right way, then."
"here, i got - i got - let me get it piece by piece."
all right. i'm going to take - put it right on here.
"you know, hank, you wouldn't think you could lose something in only 12 feet. right now, i've probably got more things lost than i've got found."
"gene, if this is what you mean, it's - -"
"well, they're hoping again at station 9."
we thank you.
"okay. stand by. 3, 2, 1 -"
"thank you. i was worried about getting in vhe same problem we get into after undocking tomorrow, where it might take a special angle."
"al, we've got 30 seconds until the mapping camera comes off. and then, i minute later, we start rewing up for the earthshine photos."

delta for me and bravo for you. thank you.

no. they - they don't want me to play and find out. 10 o0 55 02 imp oh.
say again.
"roger. i just - we didn't get a view of the site, though, going over this time. i think it was off to the north of us just a tad. that's the best example of a mare - marelike ridge that was as clearly constructional as i would want to see it. _- out on the mare, it's never quite that obvious. but there, it climbed up over a hill and then back down again."
"jim, concerning that 16-millimeter camera, if you're changing the mag out, you might try the one-frame- per-second trick at the beginning. it worked before."
"the ejecta material is about the - yes, that the - okay, here we come on - well, it's an odd angle, but i guess it will work. good. i want to get some of the - 30 and let's see. the first one started at tacquet. i'm going to whip her back one and get one of - back the other way, because that's kind of a change in - in the color. the color of the area changes right at the tacquet ! rille to - to the brown - browns. this - i forgot my little ""gouge,"" here. it goes north of malinius [sic], doesn't it?"
is that enough?
"well, we've got the first team on - the gold team - your loi and landing team, and the lm guys are merritt and thorson."
"roger, jim."

i don't have a bag.
"okay. we're going to retract the mapping camera. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1-"
wait a minute ... i should have ...

there's mine.
check off the good things i did. you did. we did.
"right now, gordo. we'd love to hear it. 08 19 38 35 6c okay. let me start with the america's gear there. the - on the uv spectrometer, well, actually having to do with uv. during - back dur_lng rev 38, they sent an aerobee sounding rocket from white sands, up, and it carried a uv spectrometer above the atmosphere and successfully acquired solar uv calibration data. farside terminator shows there is a hydrogen atmosphere, but it is much less than had been predicted. the pi is very happy with the mode 4 maneuver. on the ir scanning radiom- eter, it's still performing beautifully, and the pi is getting lots of high-quality data, and i understand is ecstatic about it. on rev 33, the crater kepler c showed up as a 132-degree kelvin anomaly on a 94 degree kelvin background after 11.6 days of lunar night, the crater reiner was a similar anomaly on that revolution, in iow orbit on rev 9, kepler a showed a broad honspov corresponming to its ejecta blanket wi%h a sharp spike corresponaing to %he crater in nne cen_er. one coldspot anomaly seems to correspcnd to a cinder cone-like feature in mare 0rien_ale near the cra_er hohmanr_. on the i_ar so_naer_ tele_:.- et_qwmonivoring of the sounder's _¢erage reflec_ea power indicates that the mare anm kiglt_snas e_d_iblv markedly different refiectivivy, bc%h im_ mhd vhf. the data is consistent with distinct layering in the mare, as would be expected, where the mare flooded by successive layers of lava, although, they say other explanations are possible. they don't see that layering - indication in the highlands. predicted topographic signatures over features such as craters and mare ridges have been confirmed in principal. of course, as you know, until they get the film back they don't have - they can't really reach any definite con- clusions. on the cameras - the cameras, both cameras and the laser altimeter all appear to be performing very well. and everybody's especially happy with the solid laser altimeter performance. okay, that kind of sums up sim bay. do you have any questions, that i could chase down, or should i go on with surface stuff?"
"okay. i_4p-eva but the big - the first thing we do is go up to the crater. bob, i think the mantle objective here really is imaterial and - because the - there's - the blocky ejecta around the crater covers - oh, boy - well, it looks like it - it extends several hundred meters out from the rim- say a couple of hundred meters."
"good readback, ron. and the earthshine photo pad is at 121:05 in the flight plan. _p okay. stand by just a second. 121:05, huh?"
this probably isn't too good a time to have an emergency.
"okay, apollo 15; houston. we're getting a little itchy for some lm data. we'd like for them to bring ul_the steerable if they can, please, at 146 and 29."
"our sunrise. well, that can't be sunrise, man. he ain't gonna believe that. that's because you're looking at it ... which you ain't gonna ever see again (laughter). every time we did this on apollo 10, a fuel cell light came on; every time we ... and i was totally ignorant of what the fuel cell ... in here somewhere ..."
"orion, let's go hi bit rate."
stand by. roger. we see you in aux.
... there you go.
"and, houston, i'm over 40 feet - 50 feet from where a1 is; and, on the east side of these craters, i have the triple core in about a tube and a _uarter; and it's tightening up again. i just don't think it's going to go the rest of th,=_way. i'm maybe driving it a millimeter a stroke."
okay. locked and locked. 04 23 b2 28 lmp-_ and you're locked.
"okay. one other thing i might mention to you guys as you're driving here, jack, before you start talk- ing again, is that - as you go by camelot, you might keep an eye out for blocks along the rim there, because remember - we may be wanting to come back and move station 5 to an area where there's blocks, unless there are blocks at the present nominal sta- tion 5. so you might keep an eye for that and plan for the way back. a second thing a reminder, if you do stop for a rover sample or one thing or another along the way, give us a call and keep us informed_ because we're timing you on the way out and the assumption is_ of course, that driving time out equals drive-back time. and we're under a 63-minute limit to get you from the lm out _o the station 2 because of 0ps drive back. so, keep us informed so we can keep a good tab."
"okay, that's all i can handle up here. one more - one more and i can put it up here."
"all right, sir; you're on."
"yeah, i've - i looked outside here, hank, and i go% the optics pointing at the moon."
"okay. and the other thing we thought you might try is to put the service module between you and the sun and then to see if you can see anything out the window in that attitude. 02 12 05 4b cc the reason that we think that that would work is that it worked on apollo 10. it made the constellations all recognizable when we put the the service module - in our case a lm, between us and the sun. pagra'208"
okay. let me - wait a minute. let me get this down around - okay. that's around behind you; thermally protected back there. that's below the ops hose.
"houston, 16. do you have any objections to our going to the burn attitude now?"
"roger, al."
okay.
okay. telmu says that's okay; no problem.
"all righty. starting with bat c, 37.0; 37.0, 37.0; rcs a is 56, b is 50, 48, and 52. and i guess everything else has been done, and i guess you got your e-memory dump. we pressurized the cabin with the ops, and, when we got up to about 57 or 58, the ops was down to 800. and i reckon that's the size of it."
"- - listen, bob. is this the t-stop on the mapping camera photo pad at 224:107"
"seventeen. 00 02 46 04 _ okay; at 56:45, it should be 14 degrees."
do-tu-doo.
okay.
okay. it's page 1-43. it's load delta. identi- fier number 5; the old value is 01606. change that to 01637.
"oh, really?i've got a good picture on the monitor."
"roger, al. we want 02 heater in tank 3 to auto and tanks 1 and 2, off. over."
did it go in?
that's affirmative. they say it can happen going - any change of state on the tvc relay.
"now, we got some work to do here, boy. you're all dirty."
okay. okay? 05 06 57 12 _p-_ okay. now.
roger. do you - do you hear it onboard when we break lock there?
"okay; that's a retract to 16 feet, and that's 12 seconds from the existing position."
"i can't go down yet, anyhow. i got to - whoops - get the lec all the way down."
yes. you going to cool it off?
"huh! i think it looks good, jim."
why don't i just - -
okay. why don't you give me a new time for tei-267
(laughter)
- - ... 02. 35799. 03 02 35 42 cml:' yes.
"falcon, houston. we're ready for the e-mod dump."
okay.
"that sounds good, and can you see spur as you look up the slope?"
comm: vhf a transmitter to off.
"oh, yes, yes. keep opening - open the jets slowly ... keep working at it."
"..... all the indications, we're probably in a - 06 00 09 07 i/_p-eva okay. checking it off. stand by."
okay. copy that - -
"go ahead, ron. cm_° i didn't have my map there, but i was looking at the landing site, and as close as i can remember, it had to be somewhere around about dn 83.3 on the 200-meter scale, the tl25-8."
omni charlie.
"one comment. when you look down into the bottom of nansen, it looks like - like, i guess - which sounds obvious - that some of the debris that has rolled off of the south massif covers up the orig_na! material there that covers the north wall of nansen. there is a distinct difference. you've got that very wrinkled texture in the north slopes of nansen, _d you've got the south massif - debris in the south slopes of nansen. and the debris, of course, over- lays the - the north slope. and all the rock frag- ments, all the boulders that have come down are all on the west side of the - of the - correction, on the south side of the slope of nansen."
"easy, easy, easy, jim- easy."
i don't know whether i said it or not - -
it doesn't look like - the - the real basalt.
"yes, i wonder?"
"jack, your bag is full; we're going to have - no, it isn't, but we ought to change it when we get back, anyway. and that one ought to go under your seat."
"it's going in bag 356, houston. soil sample."
yes.
"that's a pretty good program they've got that can figure out how to point all these experiments at the right places in the sky. 09 05 46 36 _ ah, that's old r-12 floating by. h_mm. hey, when are we supposed to cap the relief valves on our suits? john - -"
i don't know.
you got to focus it.
okay; i got the pictures.
i'm just going to ...
"we in houston copy that and echo your sentiments, and dr. fletcher is here beside me. he'd like to say a word to the two of you."
"okay, i go b. you go a."
"this palmetto right here, charlie?"
"stand by 1 on the e-memory dump, jack. i think we'll be ready in about a minute."
"casper, we've got the loi-minus-5 flyby pad when- ever you're ready to copy."
"okay, you got it?"
"okay, joe; we certainly did have a nice sleep, and we think your tracking data must be right. the moon is getting bigger out the window."
do you need to take a vertical pan?
roger.
bastard.
"okay, firs'_ of all - at 252:20, where it says, ""exit g&n ptc at roll angle 071,"" change the high gain angles there to minus, a pitch of minus 64, yaw, 32 - 329. _p okays we got those."
"okay, joe. i am pointing it over toward jack, and it's pretty bright with the earth out that window. is that sort of washing out the picture here?"
"hello, 17. stand by. i think we're having a slight handover or something."
okay. let me pull this one out for you.
roger.
"and, houston, just to keep track of ems null bias check that time, was - went from 100 to 100.7 in 100 seconds."
"okay, 17, do we copy - -"
"how would you like to get off the plss water and get some spacecraft water, too? cdr-ii4 oh, that's the next thing. suit [-'soland suit flow, on; and then we'll put plss pump and fan off. then we'll disconnect the plss water and connect spacecraft water."
"okay. we'll scratch the blocks, and we'll scratch the ""pro verb 96""; then we'll scratch ""propellant quantity monitor, off."""
- - that's true bedrock. 06 21 42 33 i/_p-eva yes.
you just st - stuff the bag back in there?
and that's a walter mitty plan number 2.
"16, we're showing good thrust on the s-ivb."
"roger. same on 16, fred."
it is.
i'll use those.
"okay, i'll send up the stuff for your cue cards later. we'll go on to page 7-1. and i'd like to know if you'd like the change in times in the surface checklist. that's what some of these changes are."
"okay, water and glycol tanks pressure and relief valve to both."
"up down ... about out of plane. here, charlie, you'll need this for your ... 07 09 04 _47 lmp that's what i was looking for. i dropped that beauty."
okay.
"okay, that's what i thought. it's a blocky crater."
"yeah. we may get a jettison before we get the cabin dumped. okay, going through about 3.5."
"well, that's what i was just wondering. there could be a little more plus-x."
"jack, houston. over."
"understand. x minus 00060, y plus 00620, z plus 01080."
that's why we had so much trouble on 9....
"quantities look good, 16."
"okay, we copy. 04 01 06 53 _4p-lm hey, jim, on those drink bags, i tell you, it's pretty hard to see things when you've got a helmet full of orange juice in zero gravity, it's some- thing with that orange juice."
"okay, h20 flag should clear in 2 to 4 minutes."
roger. i'm just trying to figure out - dadgummit! do you know where we landed? charlie-alfa 81!
"okay, now let's go over this thing here. what should i have on - -"
roger.
"tony, the - the menu side of l%, the _hings tha_ are in the menu are in, of ce_se, bags."
"hello, apollo 11. houston. your angles in the flight plan we feel are still good, 198.6 130.y, 340.0. just slightly off than those in the flight plan. over."
"okay. i'll do that, and jack'll do that other."
okay. (tranq)
"17, houston. you""_e just passed 2000 miles."
"okay, i'll get it. what's that?"
"hey, hey[ here they come, by gosh. how you doing? (laughter) beautiful ...."
"okay, that's official burn attitude."
"okay. okay, here's your old fender."
"stand in - stand in the pan, yes, stay there and i'll get your back and your plss while i'm at it - to start with. stoop down, if you can. stand on the bottom of the p - there you go."
"okay. we're running around here to make sure there's nothing. i just read through your last system report that came around here, and every- thing looks nominal. everything really looks great. okay, i guess there's - -"
...
"just exactly. okay. station 8, 10. got the sampling. rake soil was done. okay; only one boulder sample. sorry we couldn't turn one over, tony. okay; that was frame count 120, tony."
"intrepid, houston. los is coming up in 4 minutes."
"back up just a bit. right there. okay, i have the earth centered."
say again?
and the cm - the mode switch is in cmc.
"... looks like it's working, doesn't it?"
... have to get ...
that's right. you called it right.
"houston, aquarius."
"yeah, i feel good cooling, tony. move out and let's get around out of the way there. another rake. okay, tony, we got about -"
okay; will do.
"i just did something. oh, that - that's all right. 05 00 45 07 _mp-eva john, it sure looks like we're on a more than 2-degree landing slope, but it's not."
"houston, america."
okay ...
"i'll bet you - i wouldn't be surprised if it didn't come from that crater. too bad we can't stop. there's a rock that was sort of rounded, but had a rough surface texture to it, about a half a meter in size, and it was about l0 meters down- stream from a nice fresh crater that had a lot of angular debris in the bottom and the walls."
"okay, jack, i'm ready on the p52."
"hey, i got a tone and a - and i got an h20 flag."
"i got to do the whole thing later, al; i'll get them."
"and, hadley base; houston. over."
"america, it looks like, to us here, your maneuver has stopped. maybe you hit the stick. cmp-cm you roll around in this thing, you knock the thing off of lock."
"we gave you a mark when we started, joe. that stop was - was maybe 15 seconds."
"- - intensely shattered in that area, as the ones that are on the walls. *** see any *** organiza- tion of the blocks in the walls right now. *** possibility that on the west wall, there's an indication that there's slightly darker gray rocks *** about halfway down the crater. and that's - that level is coincident with what appears to be a bench on the northwest wall. and that bench - hints of that bench - *** continuous, but hints of it are around on the north wall and *** right below us - yes, on the southeast wall. the *** rocks are pretty badly broken in many cases. and - well, i haven't seen any real glass yet. *** start looking at th_m a little more carefully."
"okay, i'll tell you when we get through - -"
... and i got 15 minutes.
light on.
"okay, ed; if you think we can't get there for the p24."
roger.
"yes. i'm all ready, joe. go ahead."
yeah.
"okay. 03 23 43 58 cd}{ monitor cuff gage to 3.7 to 4.0. 03 23 44 01 l_4p okay, here we go."
"well, what i did the other night works like a champ."
"hey, houston. we have about a minute to go. we're tracking 39 and 30 on the pressures, and 0rdeal's about 0."
did you take any uv photos in - in orbit?
charlie's camera 1. you got any pictures left?
okay. i will.
okay.
apollo 15. this is houston requesting beam width to wide.
"roger, dave."
the reliability ... not to make it.
"*** okay, *** head on out."
okay; understand. no pugs after 6 minutes.
the son of a bitch back ...
"right. that procedure should go in this order. first, the s-band aux, tv to science, as is already there. then the pan camera power, on for 5 minutes, and then off. after the power goes off, wait for a msfn cue because we want to pick up some data in t_at - in that state as well. after you get a msfn cue, then we go to the pan camera, self test-off, the mapping camera, on switch to off, and then _he s-band auxiliary, tv-off, in that order. and we're going to need the high gain antenna for this job. and we're going to have a pitch, minus 30; and a yaw, of 90, and we're going to have to give you cue as to when to start this, so that everything will be lined up right."
okay.
okay.
ready to copy?
bmag number 1 power to warm up.
"okay, houston. i got a 220 alarm here ...."
i know it.
there we go.
"okay, command - plus or minus yaw for i second, direct."
"charlie, your better half says she would like for you to bring your mustache home with you."
"i wish i could tell you what kind of rock - i wish i could tell you what kind of rocks those are, iiouston, i_ut some of them are very white - and doggone, if' i could see; i'm not close enough to them, but - and i see one white one with some black; c_n't tell whether that's dirt or nos on it. but it could be a white breccia, ... such a thing."
i think we'll move. you got the burn attitude?
"america, houston. we - we still see the uv door open. have you closed it yet?"
"okay, bob. it's going to take me awhile to dust. i tell you - - inp-eva okay - -"
roger. and delete it at 11.
"mark it. okay. got a minus - plus 1.1, okay. a minus 0.13; that's almost zero. okay. whoo! man, bounces it around! (laughter) little difference."
"- - right? okay, because i think you did - -"
"okay, that pin's green; that pin's green. both _- pins are green."
"roger, al. map camera and laser, off, please. 08 0b 35 02 cmp okay, map camera and laser, off. and, did you understand the comment on the suit integrity check?"
okay. we made a good landing.
okay. sounds fine.
"roger, sir. l_-eva as per drawing."
okay; good.
"okay, aquarius; houston."
"we read you, dick. do you read us?"
okay.
"okay, if we can - we'll keep you posted, jack."
"okay_ cdr-_ okay, i_m stationkeeping on you. c_ okay; i'll do my verb 49."
"actually, it's commander transfer to cm and you mean close hatches. plural, right?"
"yes. hey, bob, we're still trying to get cleaned up in here and get suits put away and all that sort of stuff. we'll get with it as soon as we can, but it's awfully cramped quarters and there's an awful lot of stuff to move around."
"i'm going to give you some high gain antenna angles for tv and the rest is just information, general words."
"okay, i'm going to do x first. oke_, let's do it. _p-lm okay, you want 4. little more. okay?"
roger.
"okay, at 218:09, delete mapping camera - retract. at 218:30, delete mapping camera/laser altimeter cover - closed. and at 219:59 - next page - in addition to ir and uv covers - open, put in laser altimeter - on."
press reg a and b to egress. 03 23 54 49 _ go.
"yes, it sure does."
"yes, sir!"
"okay. passing 12 000 feet, according to our tapemeter, houston. spring-loaded to go grab that surveyor - -"
okay. there were those mounds mapped over at phantom area. can you see those - -
"12 o'clock? yeah, i got the rake. let's see, that's all i need. i can shovel -"
"let's hope nothing's wrong with the lm or anything, ... that baby protected - -"
what figure is the crossrange and noun 76? (tranq)
... too far ...
i think i'll go this way. (laughter)
"right up there, you mean?"
and then they kind of st - they stop just even with mel whatever it is. (laughter) malinius or something like that.
what are you doing? ...
okay. i was watching for that and i'll let you know.
tracking okay. -- 05 23 25 44 cdr-eva reckon we can get between those two there?
"gene, last night you didn't use a tone booster, and the work you gave us was that it had - it wasn't working, and we're just wondering if you want - we're thinking about working up a test board to see if - did you test it out thoroughly to make sure it wasn't working, or was that just your desire not to use it?"
"roger. 02 20 09 _0 lmp bob, hou do you read 177"
okay.
"okay. that generally - south china looks clear. i haven't had a real good look at it yet, it's out on the limb. it's clearly, however, overcast over korea and manchuria. it does not appear to be frontal weather there, though. the dominant front in the northwestern pacific stretches on a north- west line from just off luzen on up as far as i can see to the terminator. and it seems to be an extremely strong front with what i would guess is heavy air-mass weather all along it. and up to the east-northeast of japan, there's an excellent example of a shadow line from some fairly thick high clouds on solid overcast of lower clouds. don't see any major cyclone development alon_ _t_ or wave development. it just loeks like a very strong air-mass front."
you've got a go for egress. cml° beautiful.
okay. that's 80 and charlie alfa 0.7.
"all right, houston. step 4, ags rate command cold fire, 4-jet secondary coil hot fire check. hey, ron, we're going to have some hot fires here."
"okay, geno, we got that. it sounds good."
"okay, joe. everything's going good. we're proceeding on the time line in good fashion. i've got a p52 done. i can give you the torqu- ing angles."
eagle. roger.
"well, dave, why not leave 5 there."
"what's wrong? tl 06 16 20 cdr taped right now, but i think - -"
about 42 - -
dang it .... window screwed up like that? it's really ...
yes.
roger; copy.
"good night. __separate, simultaneous co_unications link in use between cc and cm"
- - get on to the - to the lm.
"stand by a second, john."
my - my bag look all right to you.
"okay, houston. we are all rigged up for sleep, and we'll be seeing you in the morning."

"pete, i show you locked on with the radar."
"okay, jack, if you haven't put magazine hotel on, we want to recall that amd make it magazine golf - gail."

"okay. same thing. looks good, looks good."
roger; 190.
yeah. it's - it's on the way.
that one right here is fine.
"okay, that attitude there should - it's pretty close. roll 165, pitch 060, yaw 338."
here's the purge valve. i had that a long time ago.

"yeah. there it is. okay. i think we can get over there and maybe get them a picture. we're headed about 360, aren't we?"
"i had to take that big piece right there .... of it got spattered glass or something all over it. 05 12 48 27 _ let's take it. why don't we take a big piece of it? and - sample bag - what's wrong with these sample bags, whether they're the - the round ones, or the square ones, or the flat ones, they're all the same size. what you need are sample bags - little ones for these and some big ones for the bigger rocks. okay, 9-b is the sample we just picked up and described, houston."
roger.
"okay, my pump's going on now."
okay.
"now, look, i got the vhf in forward and that's where we've been flying it, and it worked great. only today, it ain't working so great. why, z don't know."
where was the lm - all that other stuff at? in one of the u's?
...
would you like us to pick another antenna?
roger. good idea.
"that's why i'd get it all under the lm somewhere. i'd - what i'd - took me 5 minutes to do and get it all out of the way. okay, bob, the front wheels locked in. i had to pull the rear wheels - rear wheels back to get them to lock in."
yeah.
"okay, houston. magazine double dog and double easy going on the _t. 0h 19 29 30 lmp *** handle."
"go ahead, hadley. this is houston."
you better watch that; you're pretty close to your 6 feet.
okay.
"yes, but then what?"
_o speaks?
"roger. the trench at the base of the scarp, in other words_ some of the stuff that you would be doing while gene was taking the double core. lmp-_ what do you gain by that?"
"one zap of cold to see if it's working. it's working, and back to intermediate."
"no, i'll get it."
"and, 13, we need omni charlie, please."
roger.
"houston, apollo 11."
*** your's locked?
...
"15, houston."
"orion, houston."
"okay, cm rcs propellant, two, off."
what it says here.
"roger, and you've done yeoman service."
roger. it will be 0.6. we'll change that to 0.6 on ep-7 but - and it will really be just wherever you cross 0.6 on the range. /_ cdr-eva okay.
- - that doesn't have a blocky rim.
okay. i was just wondering about whether you could recognize whether you're on a ray by albedo as well as the boulder content.
roger. we figured you would.
"okay. and we would like station 6 at the lowest terrace on stone mountain and a blocky crater, if possible."
"*** that about the pga, dave. *** put those under one of my belts?"
"oh boy, we got fooled on that one. i'm not sure tha_;was flank we were in a minute ago, either (heavy breathing). wait a minute. yes, it is. the rim's right here. that's the - that's the eas"":- little shoulder running down from the cone. tha-5's flank over there (heavy breathing). we're going to hit ii;on the south side. we'll have to move on around it. this looks like easy going right here. see, there's the boulder field that shows in the photograph - right up ahead of us?"
to columbia? (_agle
0mni delta and you were cut out. i never got (columbia your coordinates on estimated lm position. over.
"apollo ll, houston. over."
okay.
a range update.
okay.
"jack, we want to get the plsss - the opss we want to save."
"could you follow it all the way up, vance?"
"boy, i tell you, that solar corona is really spectacular, along with a lot of other things we've seen here."
there we go. closed and locked.
"okay. gene, where's that - you want to put that little rock?"
that sounds pretty good.
i'd say about 20 percent of it's covered.
"- - 18:40. t-stop, 150:16:05. and the image motion changes called in the flight plan are good."
"okay, ron."
"okay, 376."
"the computer is yours, al. and i have consumables update, if you would like it."
standby a second.
we've got a 9 and 1/2 hour eva scheduled for you tomorrow. we're planning to spend 2 and 1/2 hours extra over there at station 4.
"roger. time 165:52:05, and the angles are plus 0.023, minus 0.003, and plus 0.073."
m.ine is too.
"oksy, john. what we're trying to do is find some way to make the procedures a little cleaner on - on apollo 17. so they think they can get some useful data out of this, and if you can just give us a mark when you start, maybe they, £rom the temperature curves, can tell just about when it ends. they got a - they're trying to get a cali- bration on how the temperature of the port changes during the dump."
what was that - -
temperature; i think is making it fold.
"houston, columbia .... (columbia)"
shutdown. 0b 06 38 28 cmp okay.
that's fine.
"stand by a minute; we'll check it. okay, 16; you can go ahead with the maneuver now."
"certainly, there were - there were - there were irritating things that happened like some circuit breakers in the spacecraft here that gave us some trouble, and some lights that aren't working exactly right. but certainly none of the important aspects of the flight or - or none of the essential pieces of equipment has malfunctioned, and i think it's been just great. okay, karl, you take it from there, baby."
"did you get some of that in your rover sample? t_mp-eva no, but i got it out of that instant rock crater."
okay. apollo 15 air-t0-ground voice transcription
"okay, dave. you're down quite a bit. scratch the black, and white magazine mike mike that was on the 500. leave that onboard the lm, and you can use ww, which is on the next line up there, for the 500 millimeter. add two more 16 millimeters, golf golf and hotel hotel."
"okay, karl. would you check the page for ptc, and let me know what that verb 49 attitude is? it says, verb 49 maneuver to ptc, noun 20, 090 and 000."
"- - 5, 6."
you have any topography changes with respect to that color?
- - they're full increase.
no. i'm just taking ... we did yesterday. and i'm left with a few here. selected ones.
"okay. we have a number of juice bags all out and ready to go, and we tried to get the water out of the command module about 20 minutes ago and found out that the command module's potable tank was empty. so we have no bags made up now, so we're dependent on lm water, plss water."
"okay. copy that. and the next planned rover sample will be at a distance of 4.2; so, 080 and 4.2. and it will be in the light mantle if - -"
"okay, okay, joe. that's good. sounds good."
"al, is there any useful comment on the condition of window 5?"
okay.
thanks for a great job down there.
let me check and see if we have any.
"oh, shit! it's getting this gigantic water bubble around it again."
"that's affirmative, ron."
okay. how about the buster area? can you identify that?
"here, let me dust you off; you're dirty. let's head on in."
"yes, he was going down ... off to the right. there you go."
"okay, i better get busy on it i guess."
"roger. copy those. and onboard readol.ts, d is 69, c is 73, d is - let me start over again. okay. a is 51 and b is 62; c is 63 ancld is 59. over."
we haven't recycled yet.
"yeah, you ought - go - ought to see the top of your helmet. looks like it's rain - little mud drops. · tape 112/13"
"now, fred, what do you want me to do?"
okay. step 2 is complete.
"if we decide to put this on later, then you can put it on for me, because it flops all over the place down here. okay. disconnect red ecs 02 hose. okay."
"columbia, houston. did you get a - copy any l_ data, low bit rate, behind the moon? over."
right.
"well, i guess it doesn't make any difference on this food if we take it back home anyway."
"okay, h2 fan 2 is going off and 3 to auto. and this is truly a historic event."
"okay. yes, no problem. i won't be on eomm tonight, but i'll be wearing the lightweight headset anyhow. the only time i was thinking about it - wearing the other one at all - would be for entry, and there's no problem there. i'll just stick to the lightweight headset around my neck and put that one around my ears just to use as a bump pad, is all."
copy. lls.
something's dark out there. i think that's it.
all righty.
"okay, enter."
okay. that sounds good.
"yeah. that's a biggie. man, it looks like it's been sitting there for quite a while. look at that soil underneath it."
"17, houston. you can go ahead and close the uv cover. we'd like to hold off i minute before you turn the uv off. we want to look at i minute of data with the cover closed. oh, okay. roger. a walkon. i see it now."
"i'll get this in there, and you take the -"
"we copy, al."
"16, houston. i've got a few deletions in your flight plan."
"hey, do we need any toothpaste up there?"
there we go.
"but you can see patterns of what i believe is pack ice - leading off from that sharp interface that was talked about earlier. and those patterns seem to merge directly with the patterns of the clouds as if the - at least near the continent - the oceanic currents are controlling the air cur- rents, up to a point, along with the movement of the pack ice."
"i think it's safe to say this surface was not formed yesterday. there is a regolith; it looks classic. area distribution of particles up to 3 or 4 centimeters, anyway. then, you start to get maybe a selective distribution of large frag- ments. got that cable? _ape 77a/40"
"okay, i'll wave to them. i'll tell you, nasa needs to recruit some octopuses. i could really use a couple of more hands."
"go ahead, al."
go to auto track. radar test to on?
stand by.
"is the rate starting to build now? i'm trying to calibrate the dead band activity here so i can tell what the rate - when it's really a rate and when it's just dead banding. okay, thank you."
right out there.
"well, i can't come up and tuck you in so - hope you have a good sleep. you need lots of rest up there, gang."
okay.
east-west.
"okay. everything *** to be all right lere. _o far, we haven't been looking ir the cockpit t. we've been spending our time _ing _ttside bae _ockpit. ***"
"it's optics to zero, optics zero to off when in cmc mode, spacecraft control to scs, translation ]landcontroller to clockwise, and verb 37 enter bo xx enter, a fresh start, a verb 34 or pro when in the sighting mark display, and the auto engine ,offor auto tvc reset after a burn in p40."
"there's a partial pan - there's a partial pan on mag a, which was taken at 15."
do you have formation flight?
okay. jim thinks he heard s_nething different than i copied on the dap load. is register 1 supposed to be 311207
"okay, houston; understand. swirls on crisium, three-photo convergent stereo, f/8, 1/250th, with a 250"
"columbia, this is houston. we show you nearing high-gain antenna scan limits. when you lose lock on us, we request omni delta. omni delta when you lose lock. over."
"hello, houston."
"okay. going to po0 and accept, and ! just got (columbia) some unexplained roll thruster activity. i might have bumped the hand controller."
(laughter) 05 13 00 15 i24p you get about 10 percent in there - -
is that right?
"and telcom, group 2, to ac2. 05 06 52 38 cm£_ telcom, (_roup 2, to ac2."
vhf antenna to aft. you're going to have to pull that floodbreaker.
"oh, no, you're right. i'm sorry; i didn't see them ..."
"yes, lost half of it that way."
170 feet and holding. about 1 foot per second down. ought to pick - speed it up a little bit.
"i don't know if this will work or not, charlie, but it couldn't pick a better spot. here we go. 05 0b 58 58 lmp-eva going to do it. there's a piece. let me hold you down a little bit. hot dog! he did it. it's a very friable rock, apparently, houston."
that little one is.
- - that's ... a block.
"go ahead. tape 9211o 05 j_ :'_ _(i cc okay. w<_'d l[ke to have jack w_ci£'y th:d, til_, ['y[_os in [,()_;1('. are [;afe, and w_""d lik_ lo r_mill_l him to do no further powerup of the csm imtil ei minus 2 plus 30. 05 18 23 4_ cdr roger. he reports that the pyros are safe, and we're standing by for 02:30."
"boy, underneath that one is another one with larger vesicles in it. 06 02 42 bb cc dave and jim, as you climb back on, we'd like an emu status check from both of you, please."
etb.
"well, i tell you, it's a tale that's hard to be- lieve. it's almost as miraculous as your escape from the pad tonight."
i'm not sure we're going to be able to see the lm.
"and, dave, you're about a - a minute from a flag on your water."
oh. 326
i got it.
okay.
"say, ron, i would like to caution you again, stick- ing your finger around or under that hook - there may still be some spring energy stored up there that could release."
that's right; my heart feels good.
"roger. 02 20 4_ 33 lmp say, bob, i took another picture of the earth and forgot to give you the get on it. that was about 15 minutes before the end of the alfmed experiment, if you can go back that way."
okay.
we should have gotten ... 00 02 15 lb cdr what?
"wait a minute, joe. not sure i'll ever get it out. what - what bothers me, joe, is - okay, hand - - handle away - away from the sun? _- 06 04 30 17 cc roger. and that drill ought to be _ood when we come back to it."
okay.
"go ahead, bob."
got to get - this out of the way.
"readiyou loud and clear, gene. do you read houston?"
okay. gear box selector - latch. verify.
would you believe a headwind?
"roger, gene. you guys are sounding great and doing real great. we're pressing right on here."
"glad to hear from you, endeavour. we'd like to have accept, when you have a chance to reach up that direction. --"
... couch ...
that's affirmative. yeah.
"well, i'm going to have to turn around a little, i think, so i can help you."
hello.
"i got the rock. i got the _ock, and there's some dirt in there. maybe i'd better get a little bit more dirt."
(cough)
we're back with you.
"okay, jack. i don't think you need to read back all the circuit breakers because we copied them as you went. if you just want to read back - the panel 8, panel 9 changes."
"well, you can't believe it, tony, but that beauty is coming out."
"oh, okay."
okay.
"roger, 11. we show you terminating battery b charge at about 51 hours 30 minutes. over."
"did you say you had sunrise, charlie?"
"the old sun angle comes down, you start to see more and more features around king's rim. this real white stuff looks like it's all streaked flow. it's hard to tell. right now it looks to me like maybe some of these pools of things - they've got dark blocks in it and a lot more ripples. and it almost looks like that white cliff to the north had material flowing into the pool, rather than vice versa. and yet the stuff in the pool looks like it's flowing down and lapping into the crater itself. that pool of _-terial runs out to the north. and this time, we'll try to follow some of these things out. the terrain out here doesn't look significantly different. it all has a somewhat radial pattern leaving king."
"we're still two revs from the sleep period, aren't we?"
and mine's 39. tell them.
"okay, houston. challenger's go; coming up on 02:30. we're through 19k."
okay. go back to slew.
okay. i'm in.
that i believe.
"- - ... ""unsnap the second tiedown strap."" time skip"
- - and we'll give you state vector and target load.
yes.
"dick, you couldn't look out the aot and - and see this thing. hell, i can see the stars in broad daylight with the cockpit light up. there it is."
"question ll: to what extent did fatigue affect your performance? for example, do you feel that you would have been capable of a full y-hour eva-3, lift-off, and i_ jettison all in the same day?"
"roger, gene. and we - we time the parabola for that, and we have one excellent measurement of g on the moon now."
"okay, gene, we copy that. that's a good observa- tion. and i also gathered that most of the rocks look pretty much the same."
"yes, why don't we do that? gad, there's stuff in here. 07 09 43 03 i/_p shit! okay; where's - where's the time line?"
okay. will do.
"looks like the walls are vertical. i'll admit the lighting exaggerates it, but that's how it looks."
"oh, you can count on that, deke, i just like to think about things."
... counts.
"okay, dave. that sounds good. however, we'r_e interested now in typical rock types and hopefully, an area that's going to have a lot of fragments around it, not necessarily just one boulder."
i said aquarius ...
"well, the covers are closed now. they weren't."
roger. 'papc 57/8 yagc_ 2496
okay. that's pretty good.
"okay. with the binocs on the area now, i'm looking down into north ray crater and south ray and the interior structures of those two don't look quite the same. there's a lot more light and dark material in the south ray; but that may be caused by the fact that it's just a- it really has been a fresher-appearing crater all around. the areas - trying to see if i can see any shadows or anything - there's a bright spot down there, but i think that's just a double spot itself. i don't see anything with the binocs that i could say i could see - i can't stabilize them quite that well. coming down the traverse route from - where they're going across survey ridge - i don't think survey is going to be easy to spot. and when you get down - there is one definite terrace - looks like the - looks like stone mountain is formed with one, two, three terraces, but they are much larger than the kind of things that we were drawing on the map. the rest of that is very fine subtle lineations. the area around north ray, particularly up along the area that they were going on the eva - i can see it now, and it almost looks like that little pile of material that runs up to the south of their track and i'll give you some coordinates on that. i'm looking at my chart a - oh, let's see, 9 charlie - yes, let's look at chart 9 charlie. and there's - this is a pretty lousy picture, but if you'll remember at a point about cy by 79, if you'll draw a line there and then draw a line down to about cu and 81, that's a - that represents a ridge, which shows up in the photographs. and looking down on it vertically, that looks like sort of a flow of material that runs up over the lip of north ray and down into it. and it shows some craters on it, but it almost looks like a flow that runs up and down into north ray rather than being some of the other kinds of things we've talked about. and i didn't have much time, i'll try to concentrate on that on the next rev."
"ron, n_flast call, i promise. i need - here's your h2 tank configuration. we want h2 t_k 1 and 2, fans to off. h2 ta_uf 3 fan to auto. and you can delete cryo stir from the presleep checklist."
i'll hold it up if you'll lock - -
"well, i wanted to get in the sun so you could read it."
"roger. hey, we're way high, john, we got to get down. way high on the h-dot."
"cabin repress, close."
_ad 1 light? we had a quad 1 light then?
i'tl probably he running out of film.
"okay, ed. look at this - you're going through - just kicked up a layer of some very light gray fine underneath the -"
okay.
"casper, you're go for pyro arm."
that's correct. configure for .jettison.
"okay. tell me when, charlie, ..."
okay. get ready to - -
i never saw that.
see how that sample bag is -
"hey, bob, i'm 3 meters to the west of the trans- mitter and about 2-1/2 meters south of the line going west - -"
"okay, we'd like it in heaters, now."
"i got some updates for you in the flight plan, back in table 2-15, the transfer-after-docking table; table number 2-8, page 2-15."
okay.
"abort/abort stage, reset."
okay. i got it.
"okay, charlie. i don't know if i can - i keep hanging up on something back there. what - -"
okay. we got that.
yes. £.620 48 46 cdr-eva - - about 2 inches or so.
"okay. hey, why don't you sock up some water. we need ... cool."
"columoia, this is houston. do you copy nv pad? · over."
"in fact, the whole area does, looks like just a big slump. something fell out the bottom. because there's no rim to this thing at all, john."
"okay, just a minute."
better get ready for the burn. 05 22 54 24 l_ okay. seven minutes.
"boy, i don't see him anywheres."
"tony, did you read?"
"okay, houston - stu. and - hey, since we only got a watch on houston time, could you give us a time - what time we're supposed to be up in the morning?"
closed.
okay.
"endeavour and falcon_ houston. we're going to delete the vhf check at this pass, just to give you a little more time."
"aquarius, houston. over."
yes.
"okay. right below the docking target, and it runs right into the top of the aps propellant tank. 00 07 18 23 _ thatrs affirm, and that axis is almost parallel to the plus-x axis."
"but look at that, narrow. you should - there is something wrong with the beam switching. 08 2b 04 57 cmp ... better signal ..."

"hey, mike. you maneuvering to sleep attitude?"

"oh boy, tony. this has been a good traverse up here ... - -"
"and just looked at the inlet screens and you're right, they're - go ahead."
"well, that's what he has in his talons, is an olive branch. o1 l0 bo 16 cc copy."
"here's the countdown .... 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and-"
"go ahead, houston."
okay ....
no land - no radar aborts.
go ahead. ready to copy.
"okay. as a matter of fact i'll make sure we're balanced, i'll hop off."
"- - aos before we do the docking probe, don't you?"
don't have any room there is right. any place we can put your bag on it? isn't your -
we don't really have to sign them now i guess. we can do that anytime.
same thing on the eratosthenes? okay.
they are all gray. are we gonna ...?

okay.
that stuff is really soft.
*** still got an antenna; i haven't looked recently.
"okay, 17. we need jack to put on magazine nancy. and we'd like, gene, for you to pull out the dsea tape recorder at this station."
"okay. stand by; i'll get everybody watching. okay. first of all, i'd like to be sure that both the pilot valve circuit breakers on panel 8 and both delta-v thrust switches are off - both circuit breakers."
that's better.

"roger, 16. houston's reading you."
i'll give you the final trim at 4.
stand by 1.
that sounded real good.
okay. we got them all.
one second.
"took a while - took a while, hut it made it."
"yes, it should be."
"oh, i must be getting old."
loud and clear.
ready to copy.
"and then went to narrow and reacq, and it looks like we got it now."
...
"oh, that's right. that blasted service - command module is back there. scratch that one. that one?"
"yes, we'll probably get there ..."
"eagle, this is houston. are you calling? over. 04 00 22 08 lmi° roger. how do you read? over."
...
shutdown.
okay.
"okay. thank you. tony, this jett bag must weigh 100 pounds."
"okay, houston. how do things look to you down there ?"
"okay. and i've got a question for you, joe."
it will. my hands aren't going to be any good for sampling.
core but it wants to slide out. it's full. no rocks in it. it looks like just the same stuff we've been traveling through.
and monitor your tank pressures.
okay. copy that.
there it comes. i see us - -
"ah, yes, it's about the same place it was when we opened the hatch. l0 02 25 15 _ okay. hatch is locked."
okay. fine. but the reticle is not parallel to the horizon. i'd have to move off quite a hit in order to get it parallel to that.
yes. that looks level to me. can you see it from there?
that's what i'm talking about.
okay.
go ahead.
"... supposed to leave it there. o0 o1 2_ 12 cmp looks like we leave it in retract, all right. talkback gray at full extension. did all those things. that's all did [sic].

"it looks like - it doesn't look like a breccia, tony. it looks like a crystalline rock."
"well, let's dump - -"
"there it is, is right. it is laying on the lunar surface. better go to intermediate cooling, get good and chilled down. okay?"
"jack found it. he uncovered it as he was walking on the rim, and we worked with that, and then, as i went around the crater to take the stereo base pan from within the crater, i could see alterations radially down from the rim farther beyond where we were working down to the center."
torso tiedown. adjusted. three oxygen con_ectors locked.
"attitude translation, 4 jets."
"sure does to me, ken."
"okay, ken, before los here, after you exit that 52, we'd like to check your boom talkbacks. 07 00 12 50 cml° okay. stand by, and i'll be with you. okay. i'ye got - -"
"0.15, now, neil says, charlie."
"okay, stand by 1. - 04 09 o1 59 cmp okay, houston; endeavour. go ahead."
"so the sooner the better, i guess, which i know you know already."
"roger. about three-by, mike. we've got a lot of noise in the background. it's clearing up now. break. eagle, houston. do you read? over. 0_ 00 26 12 lmp houston, eagle. about four-by-four. go ahead."
nothing in u-2 like that. that's where it was.
"and, houston, when do you want me to turn that s-band transmitter/receiver off?"
"okay. burn status report. burn was on time. burn time was about 24.0 - about half a second shorter than predicted; there was no trim; residuals were plus .6, plus .0, minus .1; delta-vc, minus 4.4; fuel 29 - 29.25; and the oxidizer was 29.55; unbalance, 100 increase."
- - csi delta-v is going to be about 46.5. over.
huh?
"yes, they got it."
"no, i don't either. i don't know what's the matter."
"thought i'd just send y'all - got you back on the omnz - or correction, high gain now, hank. say how do you read?"
right here?
"okay. lmp-ia! i think that'll be better, isn't it?"
"that's why that's an - i knew that's what it was. what is this pressure you've got to keep lower than, charlie? explain that to me."
"roger. we're keeping an eye on it, too."
"that shaft couldn't ... trunnion, though."
everything's go at 1:30.
"hey, pete."
okay; beautiful.
"roger. just might mention the diameter for those who are watching at home. that's about 180 miles across, i think."
9 to 3. steelers over the oilers.
okay. i dumped that in the src and it's on the rover. we're gonna use it tomorrow.

hello_ houston; america.
"well, you look brighter than any star or planet i've ever seen. against that black sky."
yes.
roger. indianapolis-indiana; but that was my line.
"no, it's got a bag around it. it's all bagged, *** there."
we're down through step 7 on page 23.
copy tha-_. cmmp i got baco-a gl-cs° ti_ose are easy to fi_.
ready for the bus ties.
i can do it.
"and that's going into bag 397, houston."
"drop her. okay_ houston, one tv camera in the bag and - our plan of attack is - al?"
"no, it's no problem."
"main bus tie, off. let's go to 60 85, and what are our trim rules?"
"- - you better - boy. i better have your camera, because - i have - let's go out here where it's fresh. 06 04 00 31 i_mp-eva let me take the camera off."
... keep talking ...?
"no, we understand. thank you."
"how about a range and bearing while you're at it'."" cdr-eya yes, i;ve been t_king 10 or t2 clicks most of tile time."
"okay. without suits, it doesn't do us much good either though. 02 12 47 52 i24p okay. and are we going to continue to be able to operate off the omnis, jack. so can i leave the s-band antenna powered down?"
"okay. we're going to lose you here in about 9 seconds. you are go and looking great, and we'll work on it. and if you get another mev [?], will you check the r.er for us?"
"no, we're al_most there. what a ... 04 o1 03 00 _ okay, jim, how do you read forward omni? over."
"could you give us high gain, auto position?"
it's a lot more comfortable .... relative position.
"288.30, 27.100 .... star."
"say that again, ron?"
and swim's got a visual.
that's affirm.
so crazy they didn't even answer me.
he disappeared.
"at 196:47, laser altimeter, on; image motion, on; mapping camera, on; t-start; image motion, increase, barber pole plus 1. and your t-start is 196:49:43."

"17, houston."
"i'd say it's premature to be making those kind of statements, tony. and i would like to wait until we get all that data in and take a look at it. it's just too soon to be on - on hearsay and - and - and not having the real evidence and not having the - all the data analyzed. it's too soon to be making any major conclusions about the region. it's just - i can't see how you could do that."
"okay, houston; america. the lmp is donning his leva now."
outstanding.
maybe i ought to get up there and do one ...
"does that look like the right kind of plug, anyway, al?"
okay.
"huh? no, just dust it off. can you get my gloves a minute, john?"
"closed. cdr-i24 suit fan delta-p, closed."
little glass balls.
"pitch and yaw, maybe, huh?"
roger.
okay.
"okay, joe. after a picture. we're all loaded up. 06 22 08 34 iawp-eva two undocumented 6-inch blocks."
"charlie, houston. 01 03 40 33 i_p go ahead."
go ahead.
"... the first one.... second ... thinking about all the ... okay, thatts all down ...."
we'll do it for you.
"geno, it's time to charge them again, if you want to."
"now, all we'remissing is s, per his ..."
"roger, dr. parker. shield, on."
don't want to get it dusty. 05 05 39 10 imp-eva yes.
roger.
"go ahead, houston."
yes.
okay. (laughter )
"that's affirmative. i'm about to drop the hatch. 05 23 52 18 lm3 okay. overhead dump valve, auto, al."
"okay. we'd like to do that, too. wait a minute; stand by, jim."
... right-hand lower pocket?
"now, here's what i'd like to have you do, if you would."
"okay. okay, turn ... up."
"okay, fine. we're timing."
"on, talkback, lmp."
"okay, good idea."
"pretty good size, isn't it? 06 00 52 01 iafp-eva yeah. here, let me have the shovel. okay. i got it."
yeah.
"hey, bob, how long have we been out?"
"bob, just to keep you and the people there thinking a little bit, today is a relatively short day; but it is a good day because it gives us a chance to again get acclimated finish our stowage and just generally go through all the things that have to be gone through for the rest of the mission. we've got 3 eating days today, and judging from what we're thinking and talking about now - that the last two are going to he sort of stretched into one eating period because three meals on this particu- lar day just is not really going to be stomachable."
okay.
okay. how much further?
"i didn't get the latitude, but the longitude is minus 165.67; range te go, ]]629; ve]ocity 36291; 142:41'30."
why don't you get a flight line -
how do i ... that one?
okay. okay.
"hey, that's a- - teonfident"
"yes. great. hey, now i know why you got to check the tunnel for water."
photo 25. go.
"roger, karl. might as well get them now."
i'll set up ... before i turn the thing on.
"okay; and why don't you hop on and let me get your seat belt, we got to get moving. time's a wasting."
"*** _awing right 40. okay, auto start and normal shutdown."
"oh, anything you want to give us."
auto cdr.
i never thought i'd do geology this way.
"and, ken, for your information, john and charlie are almost through getting the alsep out."
copy 472 on that. you mean the south half of the split boulder?
"outstanding, charlie."
"loud _nd clear. 04 08 25 11 i_p-lm okay. you were clipping a livtle bit, john_"
"orion, you could do your final comp at 10 instead of 8. your preference."
"yes_ that's right, you know."
roger. auto and narrow.
how do you read_ _r_erica? you're sounding great now.
we're going to go through that data and make sure we got every single one go.

"fredo, did you get my - -"

that's what i'm doing right this second.
"we're going to let you play the return to the ai_ep game there, jack. we've got a few things for you to do out there, when the time comes."
"okay. iso valves, two, to suit disconnect."
"roger, jim. good readback. and i have some in- formation on landing area and weather and recovery forces, if you're ready to copy that."
sure did; 93:07.
"okay, al. i - i missed the beat there. the one at 163:10 was talkback barber pole plus 4 steps at that time. and at 63:40, take it to talkback barber pole, and leave it there."
high.
"wait a minute, charlie, take up on the mesa and let me roll this cord."
"okay, ron. we'll have to break away here a sec- ond. pan camera mode to standby."
"apollo 15, houston. your gamma ray, gainstep, shield, off, please."
"okay, copy that. it's a blue-gray rock, it's not part of the trench, right? you finish with the trench?"
"yes, we got a pretty good look at that."
"okay. and the water and glycol tank pressure, the pressure valve and the relief valve to both."
okay. mine is back off.
"very good news report, gordo -"
"go ahead, bob."
okay.
no. we want to hold the manurer until 55.
"okay, no problems. 06 03 05 49 i_4p-eva we're -1most back to the lm. the freshest one was the one that dave just gave you - gave you the coordinates on."
... cut i_ h_e .... ? seems like it ... on the gimbal? ...?
"hello, apollo ll. houston. we've lost our command interface with goldstone. we'd like you to switch to 0mni delta. over. (goss net 1) tape 20/7"
thank you.
i don't? i feel a little ...
great.
#** we're right with you.
"oh, man, i tell you, i wish i was putting a drjli hole in here. looks pretty nice. 05 21 58 29 l_-eva okay, bob. the next sample is mostly the medium gray fraction of the marbling. it's mixed, though."
understand.
(laughter) the exer-genie was your pacifier.
"we haven'z heard anything about sensors in the last couple of days. 05 21 37 32 i2_p l;o,maybe they gave up."
yes.
"yes. allow about an inch of overlap, and tape both sides of them."
"okay, the flight plan is out and the door is open."
33180.
"yes, but it's a straight line. i don't know what the wander factor was, but i'm sure it was pretty high."
"okay, if you go out south, be a little careful on that cable - it '11 be pulling - pulling at 90 degrees then."
"jack, we'd like auto and na1rrow on the high gain. 00 19 15 38 _mi° there you go. okay?"
okays copy. yourre moving.
yes.
"_itch is actually far enough off, but i'm afraid - got - got about 20 off there in that piddling s_ound (sigh). they wanted 286. wanted a 10-degree dead band. t think i'm going to have to go back to that attitude. verb _9 enter. yes, i'm going to have to go back to that attitude ..."
"america, houston. ron? over."
that sounds tragic.
"it - oh, it's up above the red mark. and it got progressively harder. so i think that was a good - a good reading. i don't think that was necessarily a rock down there."
"okay, i got it."
"okay. i'm coming, jack."
okay; let me look at something here (laughter).
yes. i show it just about at 38.
"samples in other bag, right? okay, it says, ""dosimeter taped to bottom"" - of something."
roger; but we have to have the wheels rolling - -
"- - get a reading on dave's camera for us, please."
"15, this is houston. could you give us a comm check, please. 08 21 58 -- begin lunar rev 70"
we got them.
"hello, houston; america."
no.
with the leva bags.
let me see. we've got one sitting right in front of us for 233:40. do you want that one? c_ i don't have that one.
"that's right. because, if i had it on 2.2 -"
good for you! fifty-lout's on the moon.
"apollo 15, houston."
then how come it went below us?
"all right; the next thing is csm/lm final sep, two of them, on, up."
roger. read you the same. 02 21 13 21 msfn roger.
that's right. and 050 - - 05 22 28 12 cdr/lmp 05060 - -
"hey, what do you ...?"
"well, we'll get ready to go anyway. you're not very far away. we'll see."
(laughter )
"okay. right now it reads, ""to exit g&n ptc,"" then you've got a pen-and-ink change that says, ""auto rcs select, 12 main a and b."" and you come down to the printed step 1. we'd like to take and move the ""auto rcs select, 12 main a and b"" down to be the second step, so the procedure would read, ""step 1, manual attitude 3, accel command; step 2 auto rcs select, 12 main a b."" step 3 would be, ""verify dap load,"" and so on. over."
wait a minute. you'll -
it seems to ... 00 02 40 19 _ it's a bull's-eye.
6.7 is what the ground predicted so - -
"- - continue looking here until we pass - oh, do you need an attitude change now?"
everything looking good so far.
"tranquility base, houston. 05 03 18 hl cdr go ahead, houston. (tra_q)"
"okay, we have one mark, no noun 49s."
what buses?
"oh, yes. or whatever it said. cdr-hm yes. lmp-i_ disconnect - disconnect 0ps hose. is that what it said? cdr-ia_ yes."
"okay. on my trusty watch, i had about 3-3/4 seconds long."
"did you see the seven rilles of aristarchus, al?"
he says he'll do that as soon as he gets around (eagle there.
"... i'm really ... hey, i'll watch this side, dick. 06 20 49 51 cml° okay."
okay. .._ransponder'son now.
yes. that's right.
"take a picture of that crater. we're driving - we going - the - the road ahead i'm going through. 06 22 31 40 lm_-eva oh, yeah. i did."
"i can't - forget it. i thought i saw something. 05 1_ 39 08 cdr i'm beginning to think that these rocks that look red to us, if we'd just crack them open, we'd find they're plain old basalt rock on the inside. we just don't ever have any cracked. we ought to pound one of those things with a hammer in a minute."
affirmed.
"okay. no medication, and the prds on cdr is 5019, and the lmp, 8023. both ples - plsss took their recharge well, and i think they're ready to go for tomorrow. and i guess we're done for the day, so wetre going to roll up the shade."
"yeah, i understand."
"did you get this ... on, jim?"
*** ahead.
i think the constraint to landing is you.
yes. loud and clear; how me?
"okay. we copy, and you're spoiling my good record of two watches without saying anything."
"orion, will you turn s-band ranging switch off? 04 06 06 06 l_-lm ranging is off."
fine.
you want us to get off? what do you mean?
"copy, john. we're working it. oh 09 59 06 cdr-i2_ yeah. the suit gas di_yerter valve is chattering; it's making a sort of a purr. o_ 16 0© 05 cc okay, john. we'd like you to switch water sep- arators. oa 10 o0 32 cdr-lm okay. we're in pull to sep 2."
"well, turn up the lights. i don't know what the hell -we're conserving electrical power or some- thing. i don't know whether i'm right-side-up or upside down in this danm inertial world. i could tell myself, though, right now, if i took a quick peek."
drogues are out.
that's correct.
"okay, 17. for antenna management tonight, we'd like you to select omni bravo at the current time, and stow the high-gain antenna. and we'll take care of managing our antennas from here on."
"and, gordy, i'll watch the cranapple."
"yes, you're going to have to, i reckon. but, that may do the job. let's see, does it come over the - i want it about right above the axle - let me - move your hand a minute. let me align it. okay. hold it right there. let me get the -"
"okay, bob, i was looking at the flight plan, and it said field of view is 4 degrees."
"we reviewed our entry stowage last night. we're going to do the stowing this morning. and in the process, why, we came up with one extra little bag up here, which we're labeling lm return items, which is essentially the same thing as 14 brought back. and i wonder if you might check with our good fido and see if he wants the details of that, or whether maybe ed mitchell can give you the - the general kind of items, and that would be acceptable. but we have one - one bag, which i'm sure you're aware of, and we'll stow it and tell him exactly where we stowed it. and if he wants the details, well, we'll give it to him."
"yes, me too. okay; let me know when you are up."
okay. i'm over there now.
okay.
"eagle, columbia. i am.reading you loud and (columbia) scratchy. nell is not coming through too well on his vox. could you be quiet for 15 seconds while i get this locked on. 04 oh 48 13 lmp okay. ( ^sle)"

"okay. it's the loi and descent team, presley, green, and deiterich."
"okays, houston, could we proceed through malfunction number 6 here?"
*** can't get those darn things out.
roger.
"if we can just find - r_ 05 02 29 33 lmp-eva as we drive along, there's several craters 3 to 5 meters in diameter. there's one out at - a rather large one out at i o'clock to us now. we have a heading of 215. it looks fairly recent - there are a lot of angular blocks on the rim of it."
"if we get short of film or something, farouk says the last part of this orbital science photos, after you get to the end of the run and change to 1/125 of a second, is kind of marginal for photography anyway. cn__ (laught er) right.

'_'_ that' s affirmative l_ _-_nat'svery strange. may have to pass you the camera in a hurry, geno. i looked. 08 20 58 00 _mp you know, gordy, the craters we're seeing around sulpieius that are orange or - orangish are very clearly orange - orangish gray and the whole, or at least most of the crater is that way. we looked at shorty today, and ron said that even the little bit of orange that he saw the other day is not visible, and i'd have to agree with that. the amount of orange we saw on the surface certainly would not be comparable to what we're seeing around sulpicius gallus."
one thing's wrong in there_ ron. the ge time - the lift-off is 188:04 on the coelliptic rendezvous pad - 188:04:14.
what? this one stopped twice?
you have another set of them by the pgns.
good enough.
okay.
roger.
wilco.
"okay, at 01:30 - just couldn't believe that these ..., and i'm already so baffled by these things that i wanted to remember about that i need to do. i w_s trying so hard to remember times and things; and there just wasn't any way."
"give me the next step. 04 l0 48 13 cdr-i_m go ahead, jim; read the next step."
that's exactly where the nav system says it is.
"i can get the other one for you. lmp-i_! okay. number 2. okay, ... many."
"roger. _mp following that a little bit farther, looking into dawes, the lower talus slopes of dawes have about the same hue and are overlaying the first by a zone that's producing - or several ledges that seam to be producing white talus and then above that is the - or make that very light-gray talus - and above that is a tan-gray talus slope that carries right up to the rim of dawes. so, there are three distinct major stratigraphic units showing up in the talus slope in dawes that i can see."
"no, thank you, charlie."
and let me get - get a bag open here and i'll be ready to copy while i'm drinking.
what ?
"well, okay, but - l_-eva which is sort of in the same class."
"roger. thank you. 05 2b 40 18 cdr-eva oh, whoop, whoop, whoop! i wish i had a movie picture of us driving."
"oh, just fine. that last sequence worked out just right on the money. clicked the last frame off, and up came the sun."
"roger, dave. are you just going to mark up the flight plan as i read it to you?"
"houston, 15. go."

and good thrust on 1.
"no, i think that's camelot. horatio didn't - -"
okays that's great - -
"roger. in the table, under item number 8."

"cap c0_, goldstone. roger."

"okay, we're about there, go ahead."
hold - hold on. we'll find it.
"call houston and give them your 02 reading. lmp-i_ okay, houston. this is the lmp on mode a and my oxygen is 94."
yes or no?
got good signal strength.
"and casper, houston. we've got that sim bay configuration when you're ready."
okay.
"mark. i'm checking the thurabwheel down to zero, up to 1, back to one-half. the yaw thumbwheel is going over to ... and i don't - let me try it again. there it goes. had the motor on; now i'm turning it off. i'll turn it on one more time. ... it's stable. i'm taking the trim, which is now set at a little over 1 on the thumbwheel, down towards zero. i move it slowly. it gets a little dynamics, and then it stops. i'm going to take it down to zero at about this rate. it oscillates, and now it's diverging, and i'm turning the gimbal motor off. i'm going to hold in this configuration."
i can't believe that they can tell any difference. that 's roll - yaw.
okay. go ahead.
"uh-oh. 07 01 04 49 lmp-_ja uh-oh. ah! we missed it. 07 01 o_ 51 cdr-eva ahh, good suspension."
"roger. and be sure to get the thing to external before you cover it there, gene."
okay. how do you read now?
"okay; the first horizontal strip, joe, is on the upper layer - not layer - upper region - of the far side. i can't really see our a, b, c, d that we thought we might see."
"from - from behind me, where we were. i_4p-eva well, i think i'll just take my radial right from here to the rover."
"- - giving you the problems, so you don't have - which one - which attitudes to avoid."
"oh, okay. yes. if you can get over there, i can get it."
going to external. mode switch to 2.
okay.
"i was a little slow on the ""now,"" but leave it there for now and press on with the normal procedures."
twenty-five.
did you turn this on?
sitting down there in that hole.
pull it up on a little more level ground.
i was just looking over the electrical system. do we have a battery a charge scheduled this afternoon?
"yes, there's king over there."
yes. sure is.
... are still out. going to 5000.
"... supposed to do that, you know where we are."
"i - well, you've been there all the time. i - i don't know. got great tv - really fine."
... yaw ...
where is it?
"okay. got a water sep light, houston."
"i'm coming right around the front now. houston, did you get that position?"
"roger. stand by about a half a second, here. okay. your time of crossing the 150 west merid- ian will be 77 50 05. over. 03 05 34 10 if2° thank you. (sossnetl) tape50/5"
...
"16, the h2 tank 3 fan should be off."
...
roll over and let me take another look again.
hook on to what? 06 05 44 ih cdr-eva hook on to the up - upstairs.
"the core's in there, isn't it?"
"i am not sure, vance."
roger; vhf coming off.
"camera is - hey! good morning, robert. how's it going? c_ real fine. real fine. lousy weather, but we're all here. cmld (laugh%er) okay. let's see - pan camera - that's verify standby. okay, it's going up to stereo. turn the old power switch on. the v/h is still in high altitude. 07 13 0i 44 cc you may be interested. we just woke up the chal- lenger, or maybe they woke ms up, i guess. they gave us a song here from - from there first, and they're all fine and they're in their surface checklist - getting ready for ascent."
right on.
okay.
yes.
"yes, right."
i thought you watched it the other night.
"okay. ags got a little bit out of plane. first one was 0900. okay, engine stop is reset."
"good show, let's get one of those."
"that's affirm; he's already left. 03 08 28 02 lma° boy, he doesn't stick around long, does he? and he wanted to read that pad to me; well, that's too bad. okay, gordy, i can take the pad now."
roger. copy.
... - -
"oh, about 20 minutes."
six feet? 05 22 51 02 ij__c - - 6 feet's infinity. 05 22 5i 06 cdr okay.
"yes, i couldn't see it. that camera stopped. it wouldrve been fantastic. i don't know when it stopped - -"
"see, you gave me an update on 30704 and 31005, and i just erased it."
...
"... or break the tool, no kidding."
"okay, charlie."
when do we pick up houston?
"that right? 06 01 06 37 imp-eva yes. a little angular fragment, joe, about 2 inches long."
"roger. in the event of the possibility that we may have had some water channeling in those hydroxide canisters, we recommend you stay in the cabin mode from now on. over."
"0k_ r, i'm gonna turn the oxygen hack on."
"hey, that's right. it looks real dark way down there."
that all right? 05 22 lh 31 cdr-lm yeah.
...
"- - 00; 01:26; roll 015, 297, 000; north 02. over."
i - i can see with my gold visor. l._-eva let me put a sample in your bag.
...
"houston, 15."
"and, 17 - -"
"and, next, page 36, on the left-hand side."
okay. thirty seconds. ac breaker.
"roger. will do, vance."
yes. i think the problem is i'm about 2 feet and it doesn't go down but to 4.
"too big for a bag, wasn't it, john?"
"okay, they wanted it - look, itve got an area right over here that looks like a good area to work in. okay?"
okay. copied.
okay. i would believe the strip chart.
okay. in work now.
"okay. i'll give a call and, of course, your first frame is - -"
roger. and also a surprise. they didn't see any evidence of bedding in the crater anywhere they looked.
okay - -
"okay. and when you get a chance, we'd like you to stow those hoses. i guess we don't have enough friction in there, and the water separators are running wild. okay. and if you can pull your- selves away from the window there, we'd like you to hold to the schedule of starting presleep in about 20 minutes."
"yes. put just enough air in here, we're - okay; it's open, babe. okay; it is open."
that's affirm. al's digging - busy with his trench.
we copy.
"yeah, i am. okay, it's on the wall. okay, so's yours .... extra 4 inches on this hose? super. push."
"okay. no, that's good on the hydrogen and oxygen. and, i'm ready to copy the trim p30 pad."
need a piece of tape. ought to be a piece of tape around here somewhere.
t-horizon: 96:57:10. stand by.
"okay. understand. we'd like you to slide it just out of the sun so that you think - or you feel pretty confident it'll stay in for the eva. and i have a new setting for you. just try to hold the alignment you have now, and we won't realign it. 06 21 42 57 i_mp-eva okay, tony. i got the batteries in. you've got a signal strength of 4. you're on - -"
"... okay, standby. let's see if i can turn around here, dave. 06 19 26 27 cdr-ir okay. 06 19 26 39 irp-ir back behind me? 06 19 26 40 cdr-ir say again. r 06 19 26 42 lmp-lm if you can turn right, i'm turning left. 06 19 26 46 cdr-ir okay. that's right. doesn't matter."
"want to get some of these here, charlie?"
"i was informed that you called, did you call?"
"america, houston. standing by."
wait a minute.
"roger. lmp-_ gordy, just a couple more words about the north massif. it looks like a good distribution of boulder tracks. many of the boulders are acces- sible. they are - the tracks can be traced up, at least to midslope. that's at my 3 o'clock position. and occasionally, at that midslope position, par- ticularly northwest of henson, you can see abun- dent boulders suggestive of outcrop. that's something that we had m_ssed seeing on the pre- mission photos. but - and it isn't as abundant as on the south massif, but there are apparent ledge formers about midslope."
"okay, my ascent eca control is open."
"okay; go ahead, houston. we're standing by."
that's the right direction.
"that sounds like good news. 02 09 36 05 i_mp okay, jack. about how long is it?"
"okay, that 's suit gas diverter, egress, cabin gas return - egress."
"okay. eva station pressure gage still up? cml° eva station pressure gage - it's ... i can't see it. okay. still - yes, about one-third - -"
"see if you can get - whoa! don't hit it again. there, you've still got some - still got some contact there."
...
"okay, jack. the plot shows you about 130 000 miles out, which is about, gee, 10 000 closer than you were when i came on a couple of hours ago. and let me check with fido for your rate of closure."
sure ... to working right now.
... you go to b. i go to a.
"yeah, that's what it is."
"tsiolkovsky's coming uf on this window. ' confident!-, 4"
"sheel oh, isn't that something! beautiful! i'll be darned. that's a ... of something."
verified.
"- - a perspective on that crater. could you give us the dimensions, please? 06 o0 24 b1 lmp-eva where we're standing? 06 o0 24 b2 cc right. 06 00 24 b6 lmp-eva what do you think, lo meters, john? 06 00 24 b8 cdr-eva yeah. it's an old 10-meter crater; it's really an old one. this - these other rocks around here might have been caused by this - matter of fact, this might of - no, i don't think so. i think these rocks were laid in here when south ray came in."
"well, i never did get to use it, but that's okay. go ahead."
"because if it doesn't, there's no guarantee the switch is going to do you any good."
"okay, ev gloves are donned. let's check our pga connectors. do you want to check mine?"
"yes, i think we got them all."
thank you.
"okay. 00 03 25 38 _ i can shift that camera if you want, dave."
"pwm select is both; drive enable, 2 in forward: pm - pwm 1, reverse; pwm 2. and houston, i'll stand by for any comments you might have on that readout."
"yes, my rate needles are bouncing back and forth a half a degree (laughter)."
... hotter ... our ...
old eecom was watching vhe currents there. he had you pinned do_t_. (laughter) good.
"and those are your crew options for the rest of the mission, those two mags."
"okay, bob. i'll give you a quick readback on that - on these. 118:30:48; 120:29:00; 122:27:10; 124:25:21; 126:23:32; 128:21:44; and 130:19:54."
"engine arm, off."
pm.
"houston, aquarius. are you calling?"
"no, we did not send v-data. eagle. over."
187/1.1.
okay.
"hey, that stuff - that stuff that you just brought in - ... time skip"
"- - if you say so. we have got a pretty neat spaceship. the only bag of worms we're leaving dick gordon will be that big bag of - stuff here. fortunately, most of this food is - done."
"15, this is houston. the batteries in the she all look to be in excellent shape, and we're ready to secure the instrumentation. they can go ahead to page 1-18."
that's for sure. l0 00 27 16 cml° at least not up my watch.
the freaking 28 inches of core tube is going to be all the same.
"15, houston. if you'll give us accept, we'll send up a new state vector."
"in other words, it ain't good - it ain't good science. 09 21 h3 35 cc yeah, john. i think - i think you're right on, and i hope they heard you in the backroom, because i - i think i said the same thing this morning."
"(laughter) oh, tony, now."
"okay, we copy minus 99.0 and minus 98.9, geno."
"did you get suit fan, off?"
is that what they call a nonproputsive vent?
and dick gordon has got to watch his p . e
take 7.
okay; 354.6. okay; verb 60 enter.
"let me see. c_k° no, here's the sulpicius gallus. no, you're up too far, you're up too far. it's closer to sulpicius galius. right in that ridge basin, right in there on the red line. c72_ and, we'll get a picture of it."
you want me to crawl under the lm?
huh?
they did?
"there, you come up on 3.5. cdr-tj_ okay, when you hit 3.7, i'll be with you. so you can -"
come around this way with it.
"okay, we got both of those."
"okay_ it's connected and locked. okay, and your pga diverter valve should be vertical."
"670, 012, 901; 670, 012, 901."
"okay, ed. i didn't hear the solar wind called off there. did you get that one stowed?"
y'all going to give up on the heat - are you going to give up on the heat flow?
"one minute, 305."
yeah .... you ... whatever you ... it ... much to open it.
"okay, that sounds good."
"okay, houston, looks like optics calibration here is 89 995. i get that half the time and 997 the rest. so (laughter) we'll use 995, i guess."
"*** jack, you're loud and clear."
okay.
"yes, what do you need? you mean the one from hawaii back or something like that?"
"... okay. 03 02 30 30 imp mark, 2 minutes."
"okay, houston. coming up on 2 minutes."
"yes, just keep waiting,"
"- - mapping camera - oh, let me take a look; i don't think i can get my head over there far enough to tell that. yes, they do. they come right up to the pointed edge."
bucking bronco.
okay.
very appropriate. my congratulations and n_ hat off to the eecom.
okay. we'll work on that information.
"well, we'll bring you a small one of each. i'll tell you one thing, i'm glad we brought the rake, because we - we really can do it."
"yes. we're at 40 - okay, i'm with you, gordo. thank you."
change this ... around.
16. should be right now.
"no parking constraints. we'll park at 045, gene. or wherever you like, really."
what's his name? ...
"i already got the pan. 05 12 49 18 imp well, pete says he's already got it."
"yes. yes, i've already scratched mine ..."
roger. all we are trying to do is get pgns and ags aligned together. doesn't make any differ- ence on the gimbal angle.
"okay . ""terminate 509 after p24 complet_ed. "" now let me - is that the last one or you got some more?"
"okay. i'll push the other button then. okay, your readback: flyby, sps/g&n; 66839; plus 1.21, minus 0.12; 081:17:21.03; plus 0091.1, plus 0204.1, plus 0459.3; 121, 153, 321; ha is na, plus 0021.0; 0510.8, 1:17, 0506.3; 26, 096.5, 33.9. boresight star is na; plus 15.57; minus 175.00; 1099.9, 362.43; 153:24:11. sirius and rigel; 256, 152, 069. no ullage. remarks: 1, burn docked; 2, ptc refsmmat assumed; 3, lm weight, 36281; and 4, assumes no midcourse 2."
you sound like you're talking through about 6 feet of grits.
okay. 2- 8 nfidi
"there's some big black ones. see those big black blocks there, john?"
okay. start sliding it in the camera box .... i got dust on it. *** put him *** we *** got the *** baker 2.
- - we'll be around by john in a minute. 07 02 46 21 _p-eva okay.
roger_ gene. do you have a scale on the size of the crater?
"gene, do you think - got you gnomon, huh?"
"that's affirmative. and we have one update. we would like to move up to 252:10. we'd like to move up the ir cover, open - -"
"25. 05 21 36 06 l_ attitune/trai_slatioi, l,jets."
"how can you see - i didn't know you had any thermometers down there. john, could you - -"
"can you photograph it, jim?"
that's affirmative. over.
take a bath.
open my checklist.
bats 5 and 6 are on. warming up.
"yes. left front. right where the swc - i mean, the core stem bags were."
"okay, ken. i have your - - 04 06 09 07 c_l_ thank you very much."
"very goo_, dave. 07 03 5_ 25 cc and, falcon; houston. as far as we can tell, your acs is completely go. we see no reason for the master alarm yet."
okay.
want to set this clock counting up to doi?
"yes. now, we're swinging around to the west, heading, 270. heading right towards bennett hill. dave, i'm going to call that big crater, wolverine."
"roger. good readback, jim."
okay.
wait a minute. you've got to cut the other side of that little hole.
"okay, by the way, mag lima lima is empty. 165 frames showing there. started mag mike mike with frame number 95. finished the orbital science at 142. took the crazy camera at f/5.6 at 1/125. when i got ready to change to f/5.6 at 1/250, i looked at the crazy thing and it was setting at f/ll. maybe those first frames in there, maybe they can develop them a little different or something and still bring - get them to come out."
"and, pete, now for your reference on the photos. your shadow length now is 18 foot."
okay.
okay - - f_ 06 22 14 44 lmf-eva - - we're doing about 8 clicks.
"hold it - hold that, pete."
roger. i'_j/?_54
"ai:l righty, coming back down."
"... i'm going to look out this window. this is by far the best window. 0h, there's orion."
okay. how do you read now?
"yes, sir. looks like - although the blue-gray up on the hill looked like a fragment breccia, if this is still related, then it's - been some partial melting at some time."
"... should be minus 35. p72, right there."
"okay. ken, you can go wide dead band, att hold."
"okay, *** plss 02, on."
okay. let's try ...
111 - 192.8 - -
okay. have a picture. you're right there by a crater.
yes. there it is. the tracks are across the mid- dle of it.
roger.
we copy you fine.
... go around that crater.
okay; mine are stowed.
that's ...
roger.
"mono, okay, go."
"- - the last we heard, the bears were losing. bob, we'll wait and you can get up the late evening news prepared for us here the next time around."
"direct, two, off."
"well, that's because we have a whole day to learn out here."
"boyd bolts are off. bob, does it bother him that the base of the lsg is touch - touching soil? because this is pretty soft."
okay.
what?
"hello, fred. go ahead."
"hello, apollo ll. houston. we'd like you to reject the noun 49 stuff on the dsky right now, mike, and try it again. over."
"vance, you might be interested - the way we're - the way we got this thing arranged, we have one helmet attached to the comm lines attached to the lm hoses, and the guy that's got the duty wears the helmet, so the other people are free to maneuver."
"casper, you are clear to go power off on the pan camera."
"i'm - what do you mean, ""come on?"""
"endeavour, this is houston. you can expect us to give you a no - go/no go for loi before los. no, that's - that's right; that's a go/no go for plane change _ pardon me, i'm a little bit behind time here --before los, and_ since - since your burn is so close to aos, we'd like to give you a pro- cedure here, so that we can lock up without your having to go over there to throw - to throw any switches. can you copy it now?"
"ah-ha. i have it. 06 lb 20 56 cc okay. it's t-start of 160:41:22; t-stop is 161:26:47. and the remark that goes with that - you don't need to write this down - but the t-start time is biased l0 seconds prior to when we really think sunset will occur. if you see, visually - - apollo 17 air-to-ground voice transcription"

"wow, i'm in the dark. i'm at the lm ...."
"al, we can have pan camera power, off, now. 06 01 52 01 cml° okay. pan camera power, off."
only if you tighten it down. there you go.
"houston, this is falcon. standing by for a voice and range check."
"apollo 16, houston. the pis say that you should be calling your marks also down on the loop - on the air to ground."
all righty.
"okay. this is the tli plus 90 abort pad, jim."
okay.
"roger. 05 22 05 35 _4p 02 connectors, three, locked?"
"we confirm that, jim, we've got you locked up on the high gain and narrow beam."
hold it.
"and, bob, i'm really only penetrating - i'm only penetrating about, at the most, 3 centimeters into this area with the rake. i've picked up a very good sample of bla - of boulders but most of them were - were in that distance of the sur- face and projecting out of it."
okay. they're loud and clear up here.
okay. yaw 1.
i'm going to knock a piece of that off.
no. (laughter) it's just that you got a thermal leak there.
"okay, pan camera to operate."
"yes. that's the flattest place around here, though."
yes.
okay. can't argue with that.
"okay. you're looking at it, houston."
just a little bit on it. this one is -
roger.
"okay, at 252:30, close uv cover. and that's _o be done regardless of the fact that we're ser'_tbing midcourse 5. just close uv cover at 252:30."
"falcon, houston. throttle down 7 plus 23."
stand by.
"how we doing on time there, houston?"
"yes, i did, as a matter of fact. i think i did:"
"okay, let's look at the right one and see if the right one is the same way."
suit? 03 11 21 26 cml° wonder where it came from.
"okay, i couldn't tell from here whether that'd gone up or not. that - at a hundred hours 20 minutes, we'd like to add ""charge battery a."""
"okay, bob. i'll get the core and let jack get the 500. 559 is the kilogram of soil. i think we've pretty much covered the general variety we've seen here. i think we've seen most of them ._ in that boulder. _"
we're -.]most to split now.
"hey, you can probably tell by the comm that this is jerry. this is - the gold team has been handed over to the able hands of neil. before things go too far, i'll be around watching for the rest of the flight, of course, but before things got too far i wanted to pass my comments on to you guys that - boy, this has really been super. you guys have - between the performance of you guys and the performance of the hardware, it's been a piece of cake down here. i hope it's staying that same way up there, and we're really looking forward to fin- ishing this thing up and getting you on back home. and my hat's off to you."
"okay, it's in auto."
cabin gas return is egress. okay. ready for the ops hookup.
"you might want to go min, jack_ on your diverter."
... not take our plss antennas; that's a good thing.
"yes, okay. x-ray to standby."
5.0.
okay. you got the 02 locked?
"hey, we flew right by the crater, houston. but this ground looks neat out here; we're not going to have any trouble going back there."
pull it over a little bit more and level it up.
okay. we'll go rake.
huh?
"okay. you know those chamber runs we had were probably some of the best training we ever did. i hate to say that, because it was some work. push that thing on. there you go. good. keep trying. it was just a little sluggish. let me verify it. lmp-i_ lock?"
no - stand by on that.
"okay. put these core tube caps under the seat. got more core tube caps now than we know what to do with. 06 03 16 43 lmp-e_va listen, those rocks that are under the seat. i'll put those in bags - well, that bag that's under there before you drive off."
"16, houston. you're go for orbit. predicted cut- off, 11 plus 49."
"tranquility, houston. i'm counting down to t3 time. if you'd like to give me a hack, we can set up an event timer. over. 04 07 34 22 if4p okay. how about counting up? (tranq)"
"ohhh. you know what i ought to - as a precaution, i almost feel like pulse torquing that platform tomorrow."
"columbia, houston. we are through with the computer. you can go back to block. over."
those ... will be firing all around you in a minute.
"i think it's too short, dave, it - for - -"
and our corem is better because we have the 210 up now.
i know that.
why?
"exactly north of double spot, john."
"endeavour, this is houston. please start your battery a charge at your convenience."
"read you loud and clear, jack."
okay.
okay; we've got l/4-14. go ahead.
"well, i was noticing the roll - the drift up. see, you're going to a - a half a degree dead band - -"
okay. copy 2-1. then finish that page and go to the - to 3-4.
proceed.
"omni alfa, 16."
"okay, endeavour; falcon. our radar checks out okay, and your b-b, off, and transponder, off, are no longer required."
*** try.
okay; ready for t2.
and quad d going open.
okay. i don't either. but maybe someone who's more of an expert can clear up your question on that. i'll let you know.
i want to put that lid back on there. it would probably be best if we just left it off.
"the zero-phase riding is pretty tough, joe. we're going to have to make sure we keep at an angle. once i look into zero-phase, it all looks flat. there's a nice little round 1-meter crater with very angular frags all over the bottom and the rims, and glass in the very center. about a meter across."
"okay. negative on battery bravo. that's main a, bat charlie, closed."
my report to ...
three - tape 3_/]2
"okay. charlie, why don't we get a - whatever it is you do to get a verb 86."

"oh, that's sure nice, charlie. i'm sure glad you gave me that tsb."
"tony, i'm going over to this crater and get you some of this white soil. i think it is coming off of this rock here, but it looks like caliche. i never thought i'd use that word up here, but that's what the coating looks like. right here. right here."
"yeah, i got the pencil you bet me. we ain't got too many pencils. i hope we can get back without too many more flight plan changes."
only one?
roger.
okay. can you come in a little farther? okay. hold it right there. got to preserve one good antenna.
"okay. you've got the gainstep, one step, then it's back at shiei._ up."

"okay, jack, we'd - quick break, we'd like the high gain to auto and we'd like to get on with this flight plan update, please. 08 13 _h 12 lmp okay, you've got auto."
"houston. on your comment about the mare lapping up to the terrain - mountainous terrain, is that an impressior like a lava flow coming in around ayrominence, nell, or is it more -lcoks like it's sloping up at that point? over."
"yes, sir. it's open. 00 00 31 00 _ okay. we can - i got the window cover on. we can remove helmet and gloves and stow in pga bag."

how's the rockboxes ...?

"that's normal. gosh. who turned the lights off? we got a burned out light in one of the pumps down here. let's see, scissors. hold that for a second."
"okay, houston. we put in 2 feet per second aft. and that was done just at local horizontal."
....you got them down there? 05 22 58 k2 lmp ices.
just as well fix this bag now. let me get this bag - it's going to come off at the bottom if we don't. it's going to come off again. i don't think the harness is tight enough now.
"charlie, this is houston. we're having a hard time copying you. john's a little bit better there. would you check that your mikes are up to your mouths or have john say it?"
yes.
i'm going to do it right now.
that's great.
okay. i'm at 22.

"no, thank you."
there's a valve ...
*** the pro.
what? the tv lens? where's the tv?
"okay, the plan back at the rover is now we'd like john to take an lpm measurement and, charlie, if you could sample around the rim there near the rover and take both angular and round whatever you find. 06 01 40 38 lmp-eu;a okay."
"houston, ri reads plus three balls 44; r2, plus 26956; r3, plus 00054. over."

"i will, bob. that bubble's just not working. i - i can't figure that one out."
"okay. let's move directly toward that big rock ut; there, about halfway between here and there. it's about right up in there. 04 19 58 54 _ip yes. i need _his clear area down here for that th_._per."
okay.
"i'm not, huh?"

very good. sounds like they're doing quite well down there.
you've got the emergency regs shut off.
"tony, we could really -"
s-band normal mode voice - switch voice to off. is that it?
much debris in there?
"okay. tony, on the lioh cans, i verify two green. 05 05 h2 45 lmp-lm copy, tony?"

you have it.
okay; tilting up to you.
"okay. roger. i guess as per our agreement this morning, why - you'll get a cmp and an i24ptonight."

and we're rolling.
"endeavour, this is houston. how do you read?"
"roger, ed."
okay.
"and, dave and jim. as you - as you drive away there, i was a little hasty on my time call. mickey's big hand was actually over his head, and we're running about 30 minutes down now, but we're still looking good."
"well, i can say it in truths. i don't think."
"well, it seemed like it went from the left eye to the right eye."

no.
"this beeby - this baby is flying it right on! ags and pgns agreeing. at 4 minutes, john, we're looking for 285_"
"hey, we really haven't used much. you're right. we used most - most of that at launch and the rest of that was just nothing."
"okay. i guess we're going to have to have you stand still for a little bit here while we cali- brate something. while you're doing that, how about an emu check, and did you get that pin back in?"
"ail right, that's good. six minutes, i get this."
"and, jack, we'd like to go to india on the maga- zine for you. okay. magazine india. my goodness, we'll never get started. cdr-_fa man, we are down in a - look at where we came down, jack. and that was just one of the hills. got to go back up and then down some. hey, thank you for that fix on the fender, by the way, because i'd hate to see what it would look like without it."
that photoelectric cell is a good device. it's worked very well.
"rather interesting sight, houston. i can look straight up and see our good earth back there."
yeah.
"oh, you beautiful ... you little beauty. hoo, hoo."
"look at that red line on there, where it was supposed to be at."
how long was your eva today? 07 08 37 57 cdr/lmp 5 -

"okay, thank you."

right.
"yes, like this? how are we doing on time there, _-_ houston?"
"well, they're pretty close. i thought it was red and i thought, okay; that's good. that's the right time, i guess."
okay?

no.
okay (grunt). thank you.
*** okay.
"0kay, bob."
"okay, and i'm going ..."
"orion, houston. you can now turn voice, on again; close the power amp. apparently their little test didn't work."
"and, falcon, houston. do you know if the circuit breaker was out, or did it pop? can you verify what - either? -"
"okay. give me a mark, al, when you start using film."
huh?
"okay. the atvitude after the p20 option 5 plus-x forward will be 096, 097 and 252 and orb rate is 0."
"say again, dave."
"okay, well, stand by and let me get hold of the people and see if we can get some news for you."
"yes. i see one fairly large and isolated one. there are couple of more off to the left, but this one looks fairly good size. it could very well be the one that just passed over you."
"and, charlie."
are they vertical now?
"yes, sir."
okay....
"okay. something's a little different on this onc_ here. right at the top of the flow circle, it looks just like a finger, it's a curved surface that goes out and almost touches the - the cir- cumference of the dish. and it looks just like if you're holding your finger up and looking at it. it's that type of a shape to it. it comes back down, and it's about a half an inch wide. the flow again emanates from. a source that is almost on the fingertip, you might say."
"no, it's albedo."
yes.
- - ...
"yes, sir. you're slowing down all the way, jack."
copy that.
"okay; and i guess you't_e - you've got the idea here, charlie, that everything else that's indi- cated on this, you're going to have to configure. like a bunch of these you're going to be closing. 07 23 43 34 tz_p ye_pl, i know."
okay. we're supposed to start the landmark track- ing ... here.
okay.
yes. 06 00 04 15 _ okay. let me have them.
"hey, how's the systems test look, 5b?"
"the crater we're going by now, we're just to the north of it, fredo, is an old subdued crater."
"csi time, 143:01:50.60."
yes.
"okay, look, you can see where you dug in that; there's still some under you; why don't you give me another scoop right in there? 05 12 23 h_ cdr okay. a good idea. 05 12 23 h6 l_ there's not much in here. okay. _ere pete digs up - sure enough, right underneath the surface. you find some much lighter gray - boy, i don't exactly know why at this point, and you can look around now and see several places where we've walked that the same thing's occurred. we never have seen this at all - boy, that's going to make a good picture, pete. never seen this at all on the area we were before. hey, that looks nice. there's really quite a contrast there between the - -"
roger. we confirm skirt sep.
i guess that's probably right.
"and, dave, you might want to check tv remote."
"okay, do you want to say any more about that boulder? did it seem to have more or less the sa_ morphology, in addition to the variation in vesicle size that the other rocks in the vicinity of the alsep, and the other rocks out at station 1 had? i_p-i_ it's very comparable to the ones that we saw at station l, as a matter of fact. tape 8_/15"
"houston, how do you read? over."
just give me that stuff - there's plenty of places to stuff. good old 06 20. al1 right.
"houston, it really is bright outside. the - the surface looks almost white to me."
okay.
that looked to be a pretty good alignment from where i saw it. there's 07 for you.
"okay. i guess i'm just not breathing hard enough, huh?"
there she comes.
ail right. sounds good.
your back is clean.
"i think it's the back side of a piece of glass, but it 's brown."
roger. a good point.
and any change in the light? 00 05 57 39 cml° i didn't see any change. and it's off.
"i can see your thoughts there, ron. you're going to get those 20 shot up before jack ever gets up there, huh?"
"okay. it'll be load delta, and the octal identifier 05, and its new value is 01637."
"okay_ plus 4.5. re,er. ocay_ e_'s go v.c 2-_i, which is a pretty easy page. 07 23 30 _/o_ l}ep here ! am."

roger.
okay. plss 02 pressure grage [sic] gate opens at 85.
a lower out of mybag is all we need.
and the hatch is yours. unlock it.
"you know, i could have landed the lm in the bottom of that crater. it would have scared me to death, but -"
"yes, that's good, geno."
"i took a picture of it and - okay. we're at 228/b.0, and we're not - we're headed south and not quite on the - on the east rim."
"i read all of his reports, too. it didn't say anything about us photographing the wrong one."
i thir_ you should when you see lightning down there. ed and i saw some when you were copying that tli pad.
you don't want to?
"we're on the way now. about ready? okay, very good."
"yeah. we're not docked, but we're rendezvoused."
yeah .... of those ... _p.
"okay, ttouston, the direct 02 is coming on; we're pumping her up right now."
"now there's something that sure looks like leach, swirls, what have you. i'm going to take a picture of that guy. it's - let's see, it's now 127:_6, i mean, ll -where did mv camera go? you go at the time i want to take a picture. come back here, you. in there with the urine bags. what a place for a camera. 500 - okay, that's frame 38 on magazine victor. that's taken looking straight down at a place about - well, let's see - could that be abul w_fa there, maybe? ... find king. i've just passed king, so it must be -"
"and could you go wide on the high gain, please?"
careful. these - there. how about those right - right there? there. right - there. see them shine?
here's one that's got 15 on it.
there's one.
"say - say again, vance, on that last."
okay. mapping camera: t-start 105:29:27; t-stop 108:2 - -
"okay, ... little gadget ... i think ... 101:22:36."
thirteen.
don't move yet; don't turn around.
"okay, bob; we're about 15 meters from a 20-meter blocky rimmed crater. it's about b - b to 4 meters deep. all the blocks on the rim look like the pyroxene, plagioclase gabbro - the vesicular rocks seen at the lm. at least all that i've seen so far."
roger.
"i've got the f-stop all the way open now, vance; that's quad - quad i you're looking at with the lm should - the moon should be in view just over the top of the quad."
"my backpack's already been _±oa_ed. 06 05 30 41 l_._p-eva okay. va got two bags out that we - - 06 05 30 h5 cdr-eva yeah, extra. 06 05 30 47 12.p-eva we!i_ good. okay, we're going to have three - i don't know how full mine is. 06 05 31 0c cdr-eva okay, i _ot it .... 06 05 31 15 ii,_p-eva got it."
"well, don't - don't get me wrong. driving that rover is ... but i'll tell you, it keeps your attention."
okay - -
will you be getting i_ on downlink?
"yeah_ but i didn't get - i didn't get a closeup. i don't think we can turn that one over, john (laughter). i can move it. i can rock it."
"translational hand controller, neutral."
... they give us 2 minutes to dump.
"hello, houston; _erica. how do you read?"
"okay. we'll try another one, and it's a little better centered. in fact, the only other one we have that shows the whole picture. we're in the forward d-10 of the aot now, position 2, and you should be seeing something familiar like a radar antenna."
"all right. nothing, bob."
mm-_mm.
"roger, houston. understand. p30 pad, circ burn, sps/g&n; b7679; plus 0.49, plus 1.04; 101:38:58.19; plus 0068.3, minus 0000.1, minus 0000.7; 000, 107, _-_ b58; 0064.9, plus 0054.b; 0068.3, 0:04, 0057.2; 10, 171.b, 40.0. vega, deneb, set stars; 288, b40, 346. four jet, 14 seconds."

yes.
okay? i think that's good.
"no, i was looking for the map update at a different time."
"see, you can just barely see the horizon."
"okay. go ahead, charlie. one thing, you mentioned two rock types - the black and white ones and then the all white ones. do you see anything else?"
"apollo 15, houston."
"tony, i guess it's really a bluish cast, instead of - instead of real black to me, but in this sun it looks bluish."
what kind of a deadband you got set?
"roger, 11. press on. if you think it looks l_rel by eyeball, go ahead."
"ain't nothing you can do that's evil right now, babe."
"uplink squelch, enable."
roger.
i -
"yes, but not quite. how about putting the tip of the tool on it and pushing it. there you go."
"okay. comm, you cheek, too."
"arid that map system, tony, has got us pointed right at it."
roger; copy.
roger.
"breaker - circuit breaker configuration looks good, too."
"... lmi° what? okay, houston. i've got 3.4 on the signal strength, and try me again."
it'll be goodto get down on the lunar surface and do some physical work. you know that?
"ken, we were enjoying that. sounds like you're having a lot of fun."
"okay,"
okay.
"no. i need a little finesse, though. *** thing to reach over - here and do this on level ground. i don't know if i can do that *** falling on the battert/."
"even this thing doesn't want to go on; it's so dusty. okay. it's on and it's locked, and here's your reading. 670 - 670, llt, 301 - that's 670, llt, 301. tape ll0a/_6"
(laughter)
"16 - 16, houston. i've got a map update, rev 1_ it's at about 73:20 in the flight plan, and also i've got some answers to ken's earlier question about this glitch and what if it occurs following a burn."
now. 04 13 16 22 _ip shut it.
charlie!
"i just can't reach it. 05 06 32 52 cdr-dm okay, it's off; 94.5 percent. houston, 94 and a half."
pete and ai_ we show you 1200 feet from the lm.
"image motion, on; mapping camera, on, t-start; and image motion, barber pole plus 3, and then on. 04 23 50 10 cml° okay. do you have a t-start time?"
"okay. wait a minute. - let's wait a minute, okay. verb 34 - let me turn - well, you can, well, wherever you do that to him - okay, voice, yes. we cut you off, ron."
okay.

"man, we are really up high. rolling smooth hills as far as you can see. and on the - near side of the rille as we go down to - or up to the north, why, there seems to be quite a bit of debris, whereas in our present position near st. george, there is very little. it might be covered just with a downslope - -"
"hello, houston. 08 02 47 2h cc roger. where are you in the checklist now? 08 02 48 21 l_ houston, 16."

"could very well be, dave. 06 21 19 16 i_mp-eva *** at 12 o'clock there."
say again.
okay. your perilune seems to be - -
"(laughter) yeah. that was a little tight. i went to a - to a - half degree per second, and we made it. seems like i had some things i needed to bring you up to speed on. let me see if i can find out where i wrote them down."
"okay. the p52: noun 05 was .01; noun 93 was plus .029, minus .025, plus .018; it was torqued out at 211:52:00."
"okay. i hope you got all that. it was a beautiful burn, right through sunrise. did you get the numbers ? i tape5/2"

okay. we still have both mode control switches off. over.
"is that the right way, now?"
every_thing's looking good.
"okay. i'll cut up a little bit here. that should be about right. and we pitch. 05 23 23 30 cml_ houston, what that is trailing is a little bit of that foil --"

"hey, pete?"
stand by.
"we're doing a little zig-zag navigation. i'm - literally came up a slope at about a heading of 240. we couldn't get through the actual turn to the south because there is a big crater right at the foot of it. so we're just making our way through some relatively local undulating slopes that get pretty steep, but it seems to be no problem."
okay.
"i read you 5 square, dave."
yes.
"well, if it won't come out, i guess we're stuck with it."
"and, 13, houston. as a final effort here, we would like you to turn on the fans in tank 2. over."
"yes, we copied your vi and your ems numbers, and we've got a number for you. maneuver start time will be at 03 plus 3b plus 27. latp okay, we got you. maneuver at 03:33:27."

okay.
"okay, dave. we want - a heading of 203."
"boy, i tell you, there's no question that right at the terminator you - you pick up relief that you normally would not believe is there in the mare. i remember bill anders talking about the appearance of a sea swell within the mare itself and that's certainly clearly shown right at the terminator. unless you start to see the shadows from all the very small craters that otherwise don't show up as much more that just little depressions, if that."
ags and pngs agree very closely. ( ne)

yes. you can see it's blue-gray because of it's contrast with the light mantle.
you should see the vesicles in there - and the alinement - the orientation - of the vesicle.
"okay, 1 minute. yes, we're right _ver vitruvius a, now."

okay. here's your camera. filter's off.
okay; we copy.
"when i get a tei back, i'll copy it."
let me get the rake sample here.
"okay. and, jack, you're getting ready to take care of the charge; remember ep-4 goes within the rover seat, and ep-5 we're going to put on one of the footpads in the sun. probably either the minuz-z or the minus-y footpad, whichever is more con- venient, probably the minus-z is. just as long as it is sitting in the sun is the important thing on the footpad."
okay. pan camera power is off.

"not any large ones. there are a couple of sm_ller disturbances. well, there's one maybe 300 miles north of cuba, but it doesn't look cyclonic."
"pretty interesting, gordo. we can - we can see we're right over south america and, of course, we can see up the gulf coast. and it looks like houston is covered with clouds, but poetically enough, we can see the cape, at least we can see florida."
"we understand it checks out. we're kind of glad to hear that. 0b 01 47 17 cdr it's not quite centered, but it's about a diameter, a little bit less than a diameter, just to one side."

"real fine day's work up there, guys ...."
"well, yes, i guess that's what it'll be - it's going to be an rcs burn at about ll-foot per sec- ond. it'll drop the - it'll circularize the orbit, and then we'll do the plane change burn."
"apollo 15, apollo 15, houston. we're going to take down the network line here for 20 seconds. we'll be back up with you after that."

"america, houston. you're go for ncc-7."
i said we're getting some great tv down here. looks good.
"bob, if i'm not waking you up, an observer from another planet certainly - probably could decide that we have such things as clouds and at least large thunderstorms because right at the terminator you get a brightening of the sunlit side and a long, long shadow out to the - out to the east that is reminiscent of what we saw in the early days look- ing at the moon at the terminator."
i already got enough to do - -
"sure. took my gnomon. you'll have to get - you'll have to get the shadow for scaling, houston. here you go."
"system b light, on."
"okay. 08 13 57 _2 cc america, houston. you're about 2 minutes from los here. we've got two items - the america is looking great and as you go around the horn there's no problems open on it. if you do - we would like the lmp - jack, if you'd push on your ekg sensors a little bit - we're - the data isn't too good - the ekg sensors. and on your h2 tank configuration, ron, we'd like you to take h2 tank 3 fans to off and h2 tank 2 fans to on."

"falcon. requesting that you unstow jim's plss antenna, please."
"roger, dave. we'd llke to have you start the battery a charge first."
"well, i think it's just the outside. i looked at the lens; it looked clean."
"he meant - 052 is what's nominal. what's the sample again, bob?"
we'll want to make an integrity check.
it's - good. it's not quite as gaseous as that in the command module.

"okay, and did - okay, did the 100-foot tether also get into the etb?"
"okay, we've got it for now. later on, we'll have to change the cue cards for eva-2 and 3 and - but that's - that's the extent of the checklist change. we've got one note here for you. we're going to have a - a change to the material - the - the gear that you bring up during the - during the transfer on the eva-l, and i'll catch you before you go up and remind you about it."
"i think it's doing it now, ken."
"good morning, commander. cdr-in how does america itself look?"
it's hung up at the top.
bag's empty.
my little paw. so i'll get you a bag; let you take a picture of that. i'll get a bag; then you can get the soil.
"while we were - while we were ... i guess the weight was 25 pounds, 10 percent. 03 04 57 58 cml° man, it's frustrating when one of these things pops those things in and out. wonder what it is that makes it do this; it doesn't do it when you look at it. it only does it when you hit the binoculars. one other picture. 03 04 58 09 _ waste water dump still open?"
"okay, bob. 240."
yes.
and we're at cmc in auto?
"roger, ron. read you loud and clear."
i'm going to put them under the seat.
"oh, i would say - estimating 60 to 70. and you can track it right in, up across, over - over the ridge - it blocks out wreck and stubby - into south ray. we're going downslope now, off of survey; still heading southeast."
"roger. you don't have to prove it to me. l_-eva yes, i do."
"the rake is on the rover. the scoop's on the rover. we got the - you put the core under your pan, right?"

"good morning, down there. this is the commander of the spaceship america, and i'm glad to see that the capcom console is well guarded this morning."
"okay, joe. what reading would you like?"
"psid, hank."
"jack, houston. we'd like you to go ahead and get that waste stowage vent open now, so we can keep to the schedule on cabin enrichment."
understand you're planning to power down the fgns?

here we go....
"roger; we copy. copied the lm as plus 29465, plus 28996, plus 35502. over."
"okay, karl. got a few numbers for you on the ex- tension times. we started the whole thing off at 84:06:30. and got the covers open, the mapping camera extended, and the extension was about 3 min- utes instead of 4. then we deployed the gamma ray and the mass spec booms for barber pole plus 2 sec- onds. the gamma ray turned barber pole after 6 seconds, and the mass spec turned barber pole _mmediately. and i was suspicious of the mass spec, so we tried them again and got the same results. turned the x-ray, on at 84:15:10 and laser altimeter, on at 84:15: 30."
"i think that's a negative, ed; i used option 3. stand by 1 and i'll check."
"ok_, let's go to the entry checklist, page e/l-2."
"okay, then. why don't we move it down some time past 3 seconds, a little later. how would that fit you?"
"if you can grab the tape right off, but don't spend a lot of time on it."

"okay. and let's - let me brief you here on the ¢lobeout tonight, 17. a number of things we - we're going to do here that are slightly dif- ferent. we've got some stuff for you over at the alsep, jack, and i'll get with you when you go over there. nothing we have to worry about in the meanwhile. when we unload the rover, we're going to take the sesc out, and we're going to use that to collect the contaminated sample out behind the footpad there as per plan, and - when we take the traverse gravimeter off, we're going to want to get both a gray and a bias read- ing, because the pallet was swinging in the breeze there. otherwise, let's press on with the close- out, and we'll get with you as times change."
we'll pick it up a little later when we come back to the falcon. just leave it there in a con- venient place.
(laughter) i don't know. i had a pretty nice little home here by myself.
"okay. we're cmc. optics are - ... no, it's the wrong calculation (laughter) ...."

"okay. ""po_q_r a_,[plifierto secondary,"" ""tel_i_try to lo,"" and delete ""voice to voice."""
that's got it ....
we'll be ready to start in on that checklist in probably about 10 minutes or so; but it just didn't seem like it was proper to go ahead and press on the rest of the day without stopping for something.
"okay, ron. you're clear to torque it."
"okay, tony. the etb is stowed over in my corner."
okay.
stand by. i'll check. but why don't you go to the - to the surface gravimeter?

okay.
"here, put that one in there."
okay.
"okay, i know i told you we wouldn't update the ones in the block, but the very first one is inside the block so you - where it says ""lopc target load."" just cross that out and make that ""trim target load."""
"okay. that's what we're going to do. we're going to wait until the lm people get theirs, and then we're going to discuss it and coordinate things here, and make sure that - that we don't have any interface problems. and, if we have _uly more questions, we'll be coming back at you."

okay.
okay. what time is wake-up time?
"al, we've got your angles and you can torque them."

ask him if you keep it in auto maneuver there.
you're going to put it up; how am i going to know when you're finished?
okay. everything looks good here also.
look at the ice go up there.
is that affirmative?
"okay. it's going closed. and then stay over there as far as you can, because i got to get the over- head dump valve."
now i'm going to put bag 1 in the src.
okay.
"yeah, we sure are."
you got that solar stuff?
i think we've discovered that it is quite easy to *** you're all very familiar with.

we copy.
wait a second. wait a second. go.
"okay. we copy that. and we're ready for you guys to leave this rock and press on and either get the rake soil and cores near that crater down below the rock just a shade, or else go on to some other different variety rocks in the area."
okay. let's check out the vhf now.
okay.
chart fits right in its back.
roger.
"that's a roger, jack. you guys might also be interested, here in the houston area, all of the ground voice or air-to-ground is being carried on fm stations a hundred percent of it. and kuht, the television station, will cover the - educa- tional tv station - is going to cover 100 percent of the evas, all three of them, for all the time."
roger. lmp reads 09018. over. (tranq)
remind me to turn them off.

i'll tell you.
"that's the cockpit temperature. i've been noticing a little gage, and it (laughter) - it doesn't ever move. i think it's got a - i think it's plugged into a dummy load somewhere. but the cockpit temperature does, in fact, change quite a bit. and on the way out, in ptc with the three of us in here, it never really got cool enough even for people as warmblooded as charlie and i. and we were wondering, you know, gee, if it was like that in ptc, what was it going to he like when we got in orbit. and the first day in orbit there, it was - it really was kind of hot and stuffy. and i don't know when it got cool, but last night it was nice and cool. and, in fact, i woke up this morning because i was cold. that was the reason i woke up. and in the past, i've had a hard time sleeping sometimes, because it was warm. i don't know whether that's a - that's caused by going to the 60-circular orbit, or whether that's caused by having only one body to take care of in here, instead of three. but it was very obvious. unfortunately, we'd get a chance to - i couldn't tell you yesterday. i was wearing a suit, and so it was never really comfortable most of the day. maybe when john and charlie get back, we'll notice again, and see if it gets hot again."
"i guess the next question is do we dig a little trench and lay them in the trench, or do we just put three in?"
"okay. i got the magazine off the dac, tony."
"we'll wait on that; we don't have that checklist out yet, pete."
"76:28, man."
you cut out. say again?
"okay, dave. let me give you this."
i'm decaying.
okay - -
need to ge_ the whole thing.
looks like you're going to have to cut the cue card slightly.
"yeah, i know that."
"yeah, i can get some sensors on."
"okay, ed-babe. how about a temporary stowage bag?"
auto shutdown.
okay.
"cabin pressure is 2.0. 09 02 41 b6 cdr okay. , 09 02 41 37 cmp fixing to get ... off the peg pretty soon."
"okay, houston; hadley base on vox. how do you read?"

we agree.
"roger, jack. we're going to be going a little bit south of that area."

"4 jet. balance couple, on."

okay.
"hello, endeavour, this is houston."
this velcro just doesn't work. i just come right up off it.
"15, we copied. and stand by; within i or 2 min- utes, we'll be able to give you a go."

"yes, yes."
"hey, a1 .... ?"
roger.

challenger; houston. i have a new ags k factor for you.
"okay, pete. let me level it up. i think it's pretty near level. it's lined up exactly east. if i give it a couple of pushes."
roger. copy.
"yes, i believe you, gene."
"okay. we can leave the vhf powered down, too."
yeah.
"okay, al. the mapping camera comes off in about 30 seconds."
okay.
"two of them are around this way. cml° does take a lot of tape, doesn't it?"
okay. i'll tell him that right now.
"i guess i agree it surely would be nice to docu- ment it someway _f we can, but it doesn't look like ..."
both weigh the same?
"lm water is open, and 02 is open."
"it's down. cdr-_za i'll take a look at that gage again, but the gage on the high battery looked like it may have failed. okay, lcru blankets are open, battery covers are closed and pushed closed, dust lcru -"
yes.
our 19:16.
"even my total body weight won't do it, so i'm going to have to stick one arm under you."
roger.
"are you using the 16, charlie?"
the cover?
"on 8-16, change the time ""171 plus 33"" to ""175 plus 32."" change the time ""171 plus 35"" to ""175 plus 34."" and at the bottom change ""171 plus 40"" - -"
"well, through the - to the visual - just to your eyeball, it looks like a - i'll have to catch that again later, but it looked, to the eyeball, like it had a little crater in it. when i got the binoculars on it, it looked like there was just a section of it that was broken out."
okay. sm/ac power is on.
okay. and ... all these goodies. and i'll help you with your snap. meanwhile -
"okay, locked. i'll get the back of it. can you lock - verify your own alignment?"
i'm okay. oh 15 29 34 _ about ready to send up the lec?
"roger. i guess part of the camera's been burnt out down there. these are really beautiful pic- tures now, buzz. over. real clear."

"okay. 'i'mgoing to start right now, vance."
yes.
"see, we - our range rates should be -"
okay.
ecs looks good.
you want to get - you want to hang on the rover?
165. you better change that out.
"okay, tony. this is really a - really a ray. you can - in fact, you can see coming out over the ridge - you can distinctly see the rays from south ray - the whiter albedo in the - and the contact between the white ray and the cayley here. quite apparent."
"copy that, ron. okay, we think it's starsing to clear up, ron. if you'll put it ir extend and leave it there, we'll give you a cs_ll- or else until it goes gray."
"ron, comm is getting pretty bad down here with us, we're going to lose you in about 4 minutes, maybe 5, completely. and we'll pick you back up at - 120:28 thereabouts, 120:28."

"roger. we'll let you know, jack."
"okay. there's one a couple of inches. most of them are an inch or so or smaller. they're angular to subrounded fragments. some of them look like the inclusions. as a matter of fact, the ones that are broken open look like some of the light-colored inclusions we saw in the big boulder. the others are too dust covered to say anything about."
okay; that's my last picture off.
okay.

"okay, bob. we're looking good on board and stand- ing by for .05 g."
- - the attitude we came up in.
"houston, as we go across here, this ground is - al's probably previously described it_ but it's ve_f undulating. i would suspect that there is not 10 yards, at the most, between what were once old craters. they are, most of them, worn down 9 but the surface is continuously undulating. there's hardly a level spot anywhere."
"no, it doesn't, jack. apollo 13 air-to-ground voice transcription"

just move it over out of the footprints.
we were just getting the hoses set up here for the burn and noticed that there's a little bit of water ccming out of the - the blue hose in the suit loop. thought you might be interested.
"roger, america."
"it doesn't say. it says, ""remove center couch and temporary stow under commander couch. stow couch straps in r-5."" ""meed and cover, a-7 - with cover, a-7, installed."" no, no, it doesn't say what to do with it yet. why don't you just don't worry about it. huh?"
"okay, we were just talking about that, charlie. apparently, we had a real nominal burn. our data down here showed a burn time of 6 minutes 14.2 sec- onds, which is right on the money. and i got a few words on that pc drop. i understand that's completely normal for the first dual-bank burn, due to some helium bubbles that are normally trapped between the ball valves. so that wasn't unexpected for the first dual-bank burn - you shouldn't see it again. and as far as the sps pressure lights that came on, we warned you earlier to expect that, due to the pressure surge of the tanks pressurizing, we - you were right on the 200-psi limit - that triggered it. the second pressure light you got, which is apparently still on, is due to heat soak back into the tank. so it's not unexpected either."
"you want the lights on, now?"
we got a - that's a unique one.
huh?
i'm afraid we'll knock it over if i set it any- where else.
0kay; thank you.
roger.
okay.
right up across that little ray.
i didn't get to brush my teeth this morning.
170.
"okay. what do we - what do we need, dave? why don't you read it out to me now? ..."
"it's up against the stop, houston."
"that's a good readback_ gene. i have a tei-75, preliminary tei-75 pad for your update book."
"okay. we're in our 180, 0, 188, 11.1, 0.1, 30, 120, off-scale iow, off-scale low on the amps, bat - bat temps - looks like we had a failure on bat temp 1. it's belly up off-scale iow. let me whack it once. nope. bat 2 is 140. left - left front is 225; 210 right front ... 225."
i think so. there's a fairly fresh one here with - angular blocks on the rim. t
"okay. stand by, ron. okay?"
"no, i don't think ken wrote this thing. don't worry about the dosimeter."
"okay, number 2 is going to off, now?"
okay.
"okay, houston. i'm starting the lrv checkout."
how do you read on omni alfa?
"stand by a min_e, fred. we're in a bad comm mode."
okay. we got that.
you want me to get my scoop under there? probably won't fall out.
okay.
okay.
enter.
okay. you got it.
"okay, gene, are you at the rover?"
did you - did you this morning?
"okay, ken. we don't have high bit rate. the way you can do this is - - 08 03 0i 29 cmp _._ihatshould they be, please? 08 03 0! 33 cc okay. we just want the single-_et authority in roll. that's the only thing we have to worry at3out the boom. and you're gonna have to hum out the - your y as if you were %rimming the plane- change burn, using that same roll and - roll 90 degrees to get rid of your y. 08 03 02 08 c_,[p if i go into attitude, i can get it all in - get rid of the y anyhow, can't i?"
i don't like that. i don't like that. i want to reject it.
okay.
"okay, chartie, hold still a second and let me get your - old plss strap tied down on here a little bit. 05 23 05 53 i/_p-eva 01d plss strap tiedown."
"okay. before we change it, why don't we check it? i - i hate to change it."
yes. clear.
"16, you're loud and clear. do you read houston?"
"yes, angle uphill here - -"
"okay, you're clear to close the mapping camera/ laser altin[eter cover."
okay.
"bob, it looks like we're going to make it on this 0ps depress. she's reading 0, and she's just barely bleeding out. we're somewhere around 5.5, so i'm just going to let it bleed out now. and then we'll stow it."
"eagle, houston. coming up 8 3!!;you'rc ],-,kiug great."
you take cabin photos during rendezvous.
"okay, it's locked up in auto."
"ken is, huh? (laughter)"
"roger. we already look iow, and we got 180 degrees to go, babe."
i wish i wouldn't lose - start concentrating. i'm forgetting to take my pictures.
"okay, the master craftsman."
"contrast has increased and only the sunlit side of these ridges remain illuminated, while the dark sides and the shadow will become com- pletely black."
"okay, dave. be advised the program manager says he'll wait until tomorrow until he decides about that engine bell."
"would you please stand by, eagle. we want to get to the proper sleep attitude before we proceed on with the comm check. over. 03 11 1i 23 _ standing by."
okay.
loud and clear. you're loud and - -
(laughter) i'm one of those darn octopies [?]. i -
go ahead.
"okay. now that there's no noise, you can give ..."
okay. copy 91.
"trans control power, off."
"okay, the delta-v check was - test was satisfactory. it was a residual minus 21.0 in l0 seconds, and the null bias was .8 feet in 100 seconds."
"oh, the old white team's bright-eyed and bushy- tailed. we're ever alert down here. 01 06 51 33 cml° ever alert and ... hey, you got any m_dics down there watching high grade? i'm trying to do some running in place down here, and i'm wondering just out of curiosity whether it brings my heart rate up. 01 06 51 _$4 cc well, they will spring into action here momentarily. stand by. 01 06 52 >_2 cc hello, 11. we see yo_ir heart beating."
"trouble with the terminator, this moon is so ragged, i can't - do it even. i'll get a decent terminator shot."
"okay; and, gene, you need to close that caution and warning flag. it's heat sink when it's open, i guess."
"well, i don't think we've left you with too much to do, al. i hope not. keep an eye on those guys down there."
"okay. let me talk to you about rover status. the additional distance - this 0.6 - will - and your new position - will not affect the electrical power profile. it's really a very small and almost trivial distance. and, secondly, the lm slope, the 9 degrees by 9 degrees, is within the angles for which the deployment is specified, which is 15 degrees, and also within the angles for which it's been tested. and i guess a couple of days ago they did test 15 degrees of pitch and 5 degrees of roll at marshall, and 14 degrees of pitch and 14 degrees of roll. and, right now, we will, in real time, have the moekup at marshall positioned corresponding to our pitchup of 9 and roll of 6 degrees. over. 04 20 34 37 cdr-i_ okay. that's nice to hear, and it sounds like those fellows are planning ahead as usual."
"houston, apollo ll."
"apollo 13, houston. the computer is yours. over."
yes.
"houston, 15."
okay. it's probably the most concentrated boulder field on camelot.
"what the heck? my checklist floated to the wrong page. u.s. aos, 01:28."
ready to copy.
"yes, reading - oh, it's just about - it's 10 on bat 1, joe."
"okay, tank 1 is on."
and there's - the pictures ought to be able to - the pictures ought to pin down its - at least the end of the boulder track pretty well.
"would you believe 360,000?"
"well, it was going in bag 19; it's not anymore."
"- - barber pole plus _."""
"... see, you're not - you're not only arming with the abort stage; if you don't get it, go engine arm, ascent."
"we concur on that, too."
are you through?
"and i got some pictures on the back side of - icarus and the - and a black of the sea of moscow. 03 05 01 40 l_p and the material to the north of us at the ter- minator, we don't think we got ... for. apollo 16 air-to-ground voice transcription"
"okay. you know, maybe they'll have that information."
"well, we're trying."
- - when convenient - -
okay.
"okay, ken. you're at 5600 feet, closing at 4 feet a second."
"eagle, houston. roger. we copy your signal strength 3.8."
roger.
"okay, go ahead."
"okay. and, charlie, if you see any more of the su%tle marks, how about calling them and just call them a subtle mark. we'd like to record that informat ion. 02 01 30 35 l_ ok_. apollo 16 air-t0-ground voice tp_?_scription"
it's did with the purge. 03 04 31 18 cml° oh. all right. okay· okay. this is off.
...
okay. use modified lm dps/rcs 30-minute activation checklist.
"ron and gene, we saw your master alarm. did you have any - anything on the matrix light up?"
sure look like shocked rocks to me.
"oh, you little bastard - come on."
do you have a tone?
"- - 20 21 and 30 75, and i'm going to p12. okay. i need a p12 time for you."
stand by.
low bit rate.
... fit there is long ways.
"okay. okay, that's locked."
- - that is spectacularl
okay. landing antenna to auto; it's in auto?
"okay, and just before the final comp on p34, we put the optics mode to cmc. let the p34 finish and once i'm in p40, i give the spacecraf_ control to cmc; bmags, three, to rate 2; and accept the maneuver. when i 'm in attitude, i can go back and do scs control; bmags, three, att i/rate 2; and, should a burn be required, i'll make an scs auto burn. i'll null the g&n residuals, still remaining in scs control. i'll proceed past the noun 85 before returning control to g&n. and it'll be bmags, three, to rate 2 when i get - i think the safest place is when i get in - all the way into p35. when i get it - there, i '11 return space- craft control to cmc and take the maneuver. go back to scs control; bmags, att i/rate 2, all three. deadband, max; then i'll take spacecraft control, scs; and then optics to manual. prior to the final comp, we go optics mode to cmc. again, at p41, we'll hold spacecra_ control to cmc, and i'll be bypassing the maneuver. and i - but if we - if we take the ma_neuver, it's bmags, three to rate 2. again, we'll proceed all the way through it; and, when i get into p35, i'll take the bmags back to att i/rate 2; and give spacecraft control to scs. then, optics to manual. same procedure for mid- course 2, except that at the completion of mid- course 2, why, i'll just stay in scs - i mean, cmc."
"here's a nice sharp little hole; look at that. bob, the texture of the light mantle - surface texture - is really no different on the scarp, on its flank, or out here to the east of the scarp. fragment population, crater population, everything looking about the same. if there is such a thing as a light mantle, it seems to be uniform across the scarp."
"go ahead, houston."
mark.
"hasn't changed any, has it?"
we tried that - they just don't have - they don't have the push.
there. they're in.
"up ... about 2.8 g's here. got a potential of 65, 65. 8,000 feet a second."
- - right there ... - -
ail right.
"yeah. i think you're right. i think we could turn that one over, charlie."
"yes, maybe i -"
"okay, let's see if i got it. step 2 is ""balance couple 's off; dead band, min; attitude control: pitch and yaw at pulse; yaw, direct. mode con- trol will be in ags, att hold; guidance control will be in ags; we'll damp the rates; pitch and roll with the ttca, and yaw with the aca; and we'll probably have to have some reference point, so i have to try and stop on the earth."" over."
"well, i don't know. i'll check and see if ..."
"*** there, gene. scb-6? scb-4; copy."
"ah so, here we go! hey, we're going up to where it's more cobbly, tony, to get the rake sample. it's pretty smooth right here."
"roger. they're in the flight plan at 216. the first one is the solar corona photo pad. t-start is 216:03:55. down below, the mapping camera photo pad: start, 216:18:30, stop 217:18:15."
go ahead.
good boy? okay.
yeah.
no problem?
like that?
"roger, eagle. and you are stay for - -"
what do you see out your upper window?
i'd like to enter aldrin in the oatmeal eating contest next time.
"yes, burn time is 9.6. clock's right on."
"you know what we can also do, dave, is wet wipe the mags. might be even better then - wet wipe them - get a towel - damp towel here - just wipe them off."
"well, do you want me to recock it and fire it?"
0h!
"(laughter) sim sup is having a f%eld day. okay. this will take me a f_w minutes, but i'll - i'll get there. 07 21 hh 09 cc i'm considering resigning s_fter this shift."
"17, did you call?"
yes.... bad.
"yes, that's horatio. we're right on course, sir. there's a little depression we didn't talk about, though, between horatio and camelot. but it's a depression and not a blocky crater at all. as a matter of fact _ the total block population has changed out on the - once we get away from the rim of camelot the block frequency is quite a bit smaller, it's down - maybe to only - less than 1 percent of the surface."
"there's a little black thing, under ... houston, we just found one of those little black things. 04 23 32 o0 _ip-eva a little black disk. it looked like it's probably a bumper guard. something in the stowage area, tony. but it's no consequence. man, can you thing - sling things a long way. look at that. went into that crater. too bad there isn't something to lean on. i have a tough time kneeling in this suit."
okay.
"okay, i'm looking up here."
okay.
give me that last one again.
"bob wanted a core here, too, huh?"
the up-link activity light went out.
"and, ken, i'd appreciate it if from time to time, you'd just give me a idea of where you are in the che2klist."
"gee, that's very interesting because i would say that the jolt in here was very minor."
let me check my circuit breakers first.
roger. reacq.
then what?
"roger, jack. read you loud and clear; how us? you're loud and clear. and no change systems- wise that i've seen."
roger. so you estimate your present position less than half a mile approximately west of this large crater. over. 0h 18 46 56 cdr that's correct. (tranq )
let me - bend over and i'll get your antenna. i'll put my visor down.
*** good. ial 8 _ 5-217
"okay, let me - we're at 4, 3.8, 3.7, 3-1/2. close."
"okay. what's it look like? ...? 05 22 37 51 imp mi:_us 40. that's pretty damn close. if you'll change - let raegive you ariapogee and perigee to reset on. there's 44 1 by - by 59, so it's l_ by 60. okay."
you don't need the h_w_er - we don't need the hsmmer.
"okay, on my mark. 3, 2, i - ok l0 57 24 cdr mark it. we heard it."
"well, yes. as a matter of fact, we have a little bit made up here. i guess along the personal line, we checked with barbara and jan and the kids, and they're all back home safe and sound and they men- tioned that they're going into their own personal quarantine period, glued to the squawk box. over."
...
stand by.
"yes, looks like it's all the way in."
what ?
ail right .... lot of space.
is it locked?
yes.
"okay, you going to read up the procedures real time on the mass spec boom?"
really got what?
and- -
mode normal.
why don't you come over here and get your scoop and scoop me up one big rock?
"and, fred, the computer has your target load in."
"did you get all of your jettison - optics dust cover jettison checklist, stu? 00 00 32 39 cml° yes, i did. 00 00 32 hl lmp okay. g/n optics, on. optics zero, off."

"yes, sir. helmet's coming on. yes."
"jack, there's no need to go back. just keep on going."
and i'm going to ....
"apollo 16, houston. everything looks good down here. you've got a go for doi, and the monitoring limits in the flight plan are good."
"right. and the station 4, 5, and 6 area - you mentioned that 5 and 6 got progressively - the surfaces got progressively firmer. i wonder, could you see any contact or was it a gradual thing? 06 08 16 51 _4p-_ no, we couldn't. just when we got off the rover and felt it under your feet. the softest spot was up on the top, at svation 4. progressively firmer as we went out, like you say, went down to 6. and you just noticed it when you got out."
"ycu just over'ourned, anyway, by god."
"aquarius, itouston. over."
"okay, houston. amp-hours, i'm reading 115, amps are 0. volts are 82 and 82. batteries are - 95 and t10. forward motors are off scale iow, off scale low, and rears are off scale iow, off scale low. houston, you with us?"

"okay, we just didn't hear your call and we want to make sure of that. didn't want to miss anything here. cml° okay. they are - they are verified closed, and jack just checked them again."
push on the orange juice and everything will be fine?

2:11. v circular.
"this hole out here - you know, this is just such an easy site to find out and to identify yourself on and to land in. but, i tell you, all of a sudden there is so many local holes that i can't think big enough."
"ken, did you ever get the meed locked?"
"houston, endeavour."
"you know, this side of the moon here, i think, is really pretty. the other side's ugly."
where did that one go?
"there's b. 04 22 28 44 lmp-i_m we have a tone, a vent flag, and a press flag, and a plss 02, rated 85."
okay. and i missed seeing you set the verb 44. did you get that one in?
"okay, houston. standing by on an rls."
"yes, see if they're ready. c7 03 27 40 cdr houston, falcon. 07 03 27 _5 cc okay, falcon. there we have you. we had a little net - net problem. i have a fip_ bias uydate for }roll."
"okay, understand that. say again, where that one is? _._p yes, that's the one above rev 62 or direcviy north of the wright brothers(?), in the 12:00 position from the wright brothers."
"that's a real great day, guys. i really enjoyed it."
okay.
okay. *** ahead and i'll - $ okay. you want to get mine or you - -

you can barely see the lm over there. that - that fills that square.
oksy.

"okay, vance, give me a call when you're ready for our e-memory dump."
... damn son of a bitch! i hate this ...!
... going to shut down at 5:52.
beautiful.
yes. that - that makes a surprising difference.
"roger. and somewhere in here i need to give you the new abort pads, whenever you can get the chance 04 06 47 10 cns_ okay. let me get the maneuvers started, and let me get myself squared away and get the t_me line i tion c_opyheatdhema.nd then i'll give you a call."
"- - something we ought to do, if we want to drag the met with us, is - see that white boulder down there?"
"we can't see freak all out here. wonder where our service module is? 10 04 13 20 cml° man, it's out there in the boonies. look at all that crap we're leaving behind us."
"okay. at 219:59, laser altimeter - on; and at 218:30, delete happing camera/laser altimeter - open; and at 218:09, delete mapping camera - retract."
okay.
coming on.
the right; you?re right.
"ah ha, okay. that sounds good, then."
yes. seeing the other end of the gnomon up there in the sky it's moved a little bit.
looks like somebody's been chipping up there. i_._p-eva looks like there's been a geologist here before us. 7
"well, there's no changing our minds now, ahe plsss are going to be hard to retrieve. but you could if you had to, though."

"i don't know. what will we do, though? we ought to think of something."
roger. i'd better clarify that cabin mode a little bit there. what we mean is you go ahead and stay in the cabin mode. helmets and gloves on are your option. and we really have no concern with the co2. over.
it's supposed to go on at 88:12. might as well get it on.
"good morning, houston; this is endeavour. doing - doing fine. reading you loud and clear."
"go ahead, jack. r g"
"well, okay. if you can get up."
how's the pressures?
i think that'll stay.
there's the lm directly ahead of us.
all circuit breakers on top row coming open.
"well, i've had my one for today."
"yes, they were also in my documented sample here, too."
"thank you, sir."
"that's affirmative, jim. you read it correctly."
"okay, understand."
"there's a lot more of these sharp depressions. i don't know whether to call them grabens or what, but these - these little sharp lines that run across - there's a lot more of them than i'd guessed you'd find."
"are you all done with the aifmed now, ron? cml° yes, i've got to get it to - get the plate moved back down there yet."
"you're getting a little farther in. now you can raise up. dave, you can start to raise up."
"yes. al, i can't hardly hear you for some reason."
why don't you mark final comp. get you back with us.
(laughter) i just about rolled downhill again.
roger.
fantastic!
"gordo, i'm just going to stop this maneuver this time around at 39 degrees."
i don't think we're too far off.
"ken, can you observe whether it's possible for sunlight to directly impinge on _ortions of the spacecraft equipment?"
why?
okay. we've got one bag left - we should have there.
"roger; 04399. 00 02 36 25 _p okay, fdai number 1, inertial; rhc nu_..ber2, locked."
it's the s-band.
"okay, jim. how's the attitude control?"
okay. we'll just leave her go.
roger. thank you.
everything looks good here.
"hey, hank, we just looked at - at the battery com- p_rtment pressure. we're reading 3.4. you want us t3 vent that thing?"
"roger. we copy. c_p okay. bob, if - would you give me a call when you get ready for that mapping camera stuff? i was kind of shoved off this morning, and i got to sample their buses."
"hl, houston. we do have a few items for you here, entry pad's, consumables, and so forth. ttfter you've had a chance to get organized, _enever you're ready to start on a few of thes_ :terns, why, we'll resd them up to you. over."
"parking instructions. okay. let's see, do we want to hit the upper rim or the lower rim of spur?"
but we think it's pretty small.
"jack, you might worry about whether your camera lens is dirty or clean, jack. i don't know what you could do about it."
"select is in 1/2, the source is in attitude set, and the attitude set is in gdc."
90 ... 59.
"yes, sir; buckle up there."
16_ houston. we're going to do a shift change now. don's coming on. that was a real great job.
i got it.
roger.
"- - cross-sun - okay. going back across sun - the tracks, we just barely penetrated the regolith maybe an eighth of an inch or so. whatever it is, it's going to be real firm here. hopefully, we can get - isn't 13 a double-core one?"
that's affirmative; we just wanted to tweak them up as best we can.
"you got it, jim. fix it (laughter)."
yes. --'
roger.
"okay. here's another piece right there, john."
"13, itouston. we'd like you to start making your way over to the lm now."

"okay, houston. we're opening the lm pressurization valve now."
okay. okay. i'm going over and open the seq bay doors. 05 04 l0 b2 cdr-eva okay.

"yes. can you see it at all, gene?"
"biomed, off."
"we get - we gather that there's no color change in the dark-mantle material at depth. in other words, the footprints, wheel tracks, and the rake sample, et cetera, were sort of uniform in color."
"15, this is houston. we're having a comm problem down here on the ground and i need to check still your noun 48 and your noun 33."
"well, i got to go get a couple of pictures."

okay.
yes.
yep.
okay; understand. no update on the weight.

roger.
no steam pressure yet? 12 07 05 19 _ it's going up now.

i think it was when you closed the repress valve.
it's not moving?
"yes, i was going to remark about that on the - the downslope side."
"hey, the lens in this one is clean, too; good."
"dave, could you physically move - i guess maybe we've lost the signal or something."
oh. there's a ... look at that.
copy that.
you remember that - that plastic bag like we ... the last day of the lm - threw the lm? there were two of those left over.
"okay, those two craters and that crater that you pointed out."

okay. good.
roger. doing fine down here. can you fellows confirm lm closed out and ready for jet? page 1223
roger. we'll see you on the ground.

"okay, charlie. it's - -"
okay. my water light is out; i have a good boiler.

and looks like it's back down.

"no, the other way."
"well, it doesn't have any halo around it."
"just something to think about. in about 30 minutes, we can generate the pads that we have yet to send up before the sleep period, so we could sup- port an earlier sleep period if you so desired. and - but, it will take us 30 minutes to get that stuff. the other thing is any time you're ready to copy, i can read up the solo book changes. over - and, also, two pages in the flight plan."

"you know, it's a funny thing, houston, in one- sixth g, these - even though slopes are steep and everything, these rocks just don't want to go anywhere."

okay. let's sample this out - see these frags right on the surface here?
yes.
that's for the cmp. do you believe it now?
that belongs in the command module. let me read you the stuff that belongs to us that's in that bag.
you have a go for closing the hatch.
"roger. then, after that, we would establish ptc again."
"next. cb, lm power 2, main b, open."
yes.

"okay. if you head into that little - well, that's a crater there."
how long is it supposed to take to get the feed- water to start feeding the cooling?
"treasure. okay. that will hit. we just made a sample of - glass bead and some local rock on the south edge of the surveyor crater, houston. and they're going into bag 14-d."

"that is that the - when you manuever, you know, in a simulator, it's just like the eye-view ball. you know, it's nice, smooth transition, you know. you look at the gdc ball and it goes, it kind of takes a jump in pitch and then a jump in yaw; a jump in pitch and then a jump in yaw. you put it on ball 2 ... ball i and it all does the same thing."
roger; copy.
okay; go ahead.
and for the - for the cmp - what did you eat on a-1 and b what - a and b?
if it's not in your way.

"joe, mag romeo has 21 frames. and i took a few, random, and probably not very good 500-millimeter of the north and south massifs - north and south massifs."
"hey, all of a sudden i get all kinds of comm. could you hear me? ok 18 28 18 lmp yes."
"houston, neil. how do you read? (tra q)"
- - where'd you leave the filter and all that stuff?
good. didn't want this vox to be too good.
"about 2 feet a second. and you're about 3 - about 2.5 feet a second from the ground. and the z comparison is 9 feet a second, so ags and pgns are both good."
"i haven't quite learned how to pick up rocks in my hands yet, bob, or i would of had you a sample. that's why i fell down. my day will come (singing). oh, oh! it's an old blue traverse gravimeter."
"apollo 13, houston."
"and, houston; i'm back in the lm without a great deal of problem."
"okay, america, tell challenger - - l_-lm and we're reading houston."
"no - bob, i don't think any of them are inside. let's see i've got - -"
"ma3{kit, and the ascent feeds are already terminated."
"al, would you turn the laser altimeter, on? laser altimeter, on."
"you hear them, jack?"
"roger. 08 05 47 bo lmp joe, how is the time going on my 1 hour? 08 05 47 b3 cc okay, jim. my sand dial shows about 15 minutes remaining. you'll be going around the corner los shortly. we don't have any more instructions for you on the experiment or in fact on anything else going on. we would like your present - a descrip- tion of your present position in the spacecraft. and, we'd like for you to remain in that position for the rest of the 15 minutes in the experiment. over."
whew. whew. well.
fifteen degrees to go. will that hack it? (_fp how's that? got me in the clear?
you can terminate the purge on fuel cell 3 - 02 ·

"tony did some of it, anl jack's been wor_ing on it, too. so we've had _ big effort on it."
"okay. man, it's really soft here, tony, on the rim. you don't sink far, but when you walk on it, it gets very -"
let me get up on this ***
okay.
"okay. we're there now, jim. jim's got it. go ahead with the gyro torquing angles."
"hey, houston. we're approaching the alsep, headed back to the lm."
"roger. give us accept, please."
"okay. can you read me on vox, henry?"
it sure is.
mark cdr. o2 o4 o3 58 l_p mark lmp.
"okay. we never got around to debriefing you on pdi, but the out-of-plane indications you saw on the ags during descent were proper. we had changed your - your vector slightlm just prior to pdi, and so the ags was navigating and indi- cating properly. we just ran the present ascent targets in the lms with the half-a-mile crossrange as shown on the pad, and you're going to be steer- ing south. that's the way the stearing direction goes. that's to your left, for geno's benefit. and the crosspointer indicated a m_ximum of about 13 feet-per-second out-of-plane velocity at about ignition plus 3 minutes and 50 seconds, and then came on back to zero. over. that - that velocity was ags velocity."
"okay. and, vance, did you ever have any los/aos times, and - and a startup time for us to jump into this activation checklist?"
okay.
huh?
roger. stand by.
chamber pressure's increasing.
pull up your tent?
"hey, now, do you have the tli card in your pocket?"
look what i got.
yes. the rim's right up here.
good to hear your cheery voice. how is everything up there?
"okay, here, you'll need this. 0k 23 23 kl cdr-eva wait a minute, that rear wheel isn't locked."
and i'm vertical.
right. can't get it ...
"endeavour, this is houston with the new 02 heater configuration for you."
"well, it might be air in the level bubble or something."
"well, is that a unanimous vote in the spacecraft, dave ?"
"houston, go ahead."
see that? yes. two little squares.
"hey, john, that's better. i move the mesa back down and it's - man, it's supernice. don't have to fight the suit. the src-1 is open. hey, what i'm going to do, tony; i'm going to bring up the tv for you."
and 04672.

okay. stand by.
take that back - or you can just put it in my bag; that's where it's supposed to go.
in pressure.
"0 - okay. all the film that we brought out, except the two mags - the mag on the dac and the two mags on the camera - magazine f and magazine echo are still on the cameras. john's seat bag is empty of film."
"okay, we've pressurize the - the - pressure in the sps now."
yes.
"and, after you finish your postsleep up there, before you stop ptc, we'd like to update your checklist or flight plan. we've got a couple of changes on the - the ptc initiation, there."
okay. how now? i just switched omnis again.
"apollo !1, this is houston. go ahead. 00 03 48 i'5 lmp roger. lm looks to be in pretty fine shape from about all we ca_isee from here."
okay.
roger.
"mark it . ah-ha. okay. g line comes across at 9 z - g's (laughter), and range indicator indicates 0.0. outstanding."
"we're coming up on antenna switch, and i think the comm is a little bad; but, right off the bat we'd like for you to remain in ptc."
"very good, houston; they're looking good on board."
... here?
roger.

"()kay. fine. and, on the lrv, we're going to ask you to go back to the normal configuration on -the pwm. if you experience any difficulty, then, we'll go back to the pwm configuration you're in now. and the attitude indicator on that pitchup problem won't - won't cause us any serious -3roblem. just when you do the nay update, try _o park in a level area, and the backroom is hoping _hat the nav problem was a temporary one; that'll be okay for your eva-3 either way, you shouldn't really have any problem because you can probably see the area you're going to, and you're going to go right back along your tracks so we're not too worried about it if you don't have the distance. and we're projecting hot battery again on eva-3, and we may have some changes during the eva on that. your - your mobility rates during eva-2 were very near those predicted, and we have a large margin of battery power so we're in good shape there. also, they mentioned that if you have a dust prob- lem from that missing fender - rear fender, there is a way of putting one of the front fenders on the back, but, golly, i don't know whether you really want to do that."
"hcw's the trench going, al? are you getting - getting down there?"
"okay, i have 91.00. and we'll use the present pitch and the present yaw, and you get the waste vent, closed."
"houston, do you read aquarius?"
"okay, houston. we'll start catching up now. we've kind of gotten over the initial checkout on how to walk and move around, and maybe we got - we won't have any problems with this hardware like we did with the - - 04 20 31 08 _ ... here you go."

i'll get it. yes.

that's affirm. sierra sierra.
"okay, that's where they are and the temperature is 100, about 104 and - -"
roger.
you are dusted; and you're shiny bright all over.
and how - how do we look right now on your time line ...?
"okay. the surface is not changing in terms of the detail. the surface texture of the fine- grained regolith still is - has a raindrop pattern. we're more - the blocks still look very much like what we sampled yesterday around the lm. they're light colored, apparently gabbros, with zap pits - zap halos. occasional craters show lighter colored ejectas both all the way down to - say half a meter in size. other craters that are just as blocky as those with bright halos have no bright- ness associated with them. most of the brightest craters have a little central pit in the bottom which is glass lined. the pit is maybe - a fifth of the diameter of the crater itself. it's a fairly standard thing for most of these fresher craters, is that little central pit."
"and you can use your purge valve to depress, if you have to."

got to switch mags here.
"okay. how about when you went around on the other side? did they poke out at you there, or were the - what i'm trying to get a feeling is - did it indicate a top and bottom in the rock, or did it just poke out all over the rock?"
i broke that one.
roger. we have no update on the entry pad. you are nominal at this time. i do have your weather information and your ship recovery call signs. over.
yes.
"okay. in your summ_y there, you answered a whole mess of my questions here. i got to slide down the list and find one you haven't answered. okay. how about that albedo change in the subsurface soil that you talwed about? it s_d like, course you saw it first time at flag and more - probably more excited about it there. was there any dif- ference in that- in - in its nature between there and buster and bt.gep mud i1_? _x"

"*** knock that seatbelt off, dave, i'll have to get off and get it."
"yes, i think we agree with that suggestion, too."
no. sure don't.
"okay, houston; 15. the tunnel vent ... pretty good, so we can go ahead and start the experiment. rape34/2"
roger. i have some switches and circuit breakers we waist you to take care of to try to improve the corem s_tuation. i'll _ive them to you as soon as you're ready to copy.
yes. there are two or three of them right at the base. 05 03 38 47 i2_p-eva yes.
"and, ken, i got a few items for you whenever you're ready to work them in. i've got a mapping camera photo pad, a flight plan update, and an update to your erasable loads, and a g&c checklist, whenever you can get a break from eating there."
okay. an i holding still long enough?
"roger, jack. the base can be touching the ground. 0b 20 41 37 lmp-eva okay. it's level, aligned, the sunshield is shaded inside. the level bubble is just touching the outer circle; a one circle. and i improved that. it's perfectly centered now and i'm going to uncage. whoops. i moved - the experiment moved. it's still pretty good level. okay, it's uncaged; the gimbal is swinging."
"boy, i'll tell you, you can hardly make out much of anything about kapteyn, due to this high sun."

"well, i can't say that this week hasn't been filled with excitement."
i wouldn't be surprised. 03 06 51 11 lm]_ we're passing some steep ridges here. the edge of some old craters that were photographed by apollo 10; and those - the crew of apollo l0 was very impressed with the steepness of these ridges when they came over them at about 50 000 feet. (goss net 1) tape 51/7
"okay. i)oyou have it there, and how long is it ..."
"america, houston. the lm has a stay for t-2."
"well, so does that big one - -"
"no, it says f/8 at start. and then according to the flight plan, you change to f/5.6 and you'll change that at about macrobius a. and then you'll go to 1/125 right at the littrow area."
no. one second point 53. 1.53.
put that back in the med kit and forget it.
very good. that's all of the update.
copy that. l_-eva okay. we ought to be going be - really between horatio and camelot now.
"okay. (;o_lc.ad, van."
"large filleted rock that - a1 photographed. okay, let's go on. do you want me to pull awhile?"
"see that crater out there - i don't know whether you can see it out your window, dave. the one i mentioned looked like it had a contact right through it; one half of it was gray and the other half was white."
what?
sure does.
"yeah, man. you better believe."
"i thought you might say that. okay. take some of this stuff back, and we'll have to walk up there. but that won't take too long."
"okay, gordy. you read that?"
"we got until 5 o'clock tomorrow morning. o0 02 13 56 limp here, take the flight plan. let me put that up."
"he may know that, but he doesn't even know whether his grass is wet or dry."
"okay, houston. it's out of sight."
peak - and average. 00 o1 05 02 _ alc to peek.
"that's affirmative. you will be running right into the sun; and directly at your 9 o'clock posi- tion, you'll see the lm; a couple of more steps and you'll be right there."
"okay, it should read that. 07 07 04 39 l_-lm that's what we figured. thank you."
okay. that sounds like a pretty good game.
"man, we are filthy!"
"i'll tell you an interesting thing about this bubble, houston; no, it's okay. it's okay."
... on this. ia{p-eva what would you just -
"okay. we're within about 300 feet of the lm now, houston. coming on at a full gallop."
"hey, al. here's a neat spot to put it out up here. 04 20 55 15 l_ is it flat for a good piece?"
you might have to help me to get back up.
now we believe you're here. we see you in person.
shut up and let's move.
check your helium valves and check your n2.
"i'm looking at a rock here, houston, that is a very angular rock, and it has white clasts with a - with a breccia, or it has a brecciated appearance. i'll take a picture of it and sample it for you."
(chuckle) well. tell me the page again.
"okay; well, let's go on a little further closer to the lm and maybe we'll come across one that isn't so - it's more - -"
"don't tell me, davey, let me guess."
looks like you guys are still there.
yes. co co 34 47 lmp ...
"except we're between - looks like we're between two contrails, one guy above and one below."
... is all in there.

"oh, man, i've waited - -"
"okay. let's take the throttle up at 26,"
"okay. 06 05 41 19 i_p-eva this is the best way to get the dust off, john, is kick against the strut. look at that stuff go."
that's - that's the soil.

"okay, tony. i'm going to be taking the scbs up ontc the porch."
roger. i understand.
"i can see that lightning, too."
...
"it might be a - no, it's not those - the colors aren't that distinct, bob. i was just giving you shade_;."
i got it.

"looks like the best way to get a steady view through the monocular is just steady it out and let it close when it's in front of your eye, and then you kind of float up next to it so that you're not touching it at all. it has a very slow drift, and you get a better - steadier view that way."
okay. do you have any updates for me before we have los?
we got the delta-v test and ...
okay. mine's min.

"sounds like you are taking a picture of that old dome out there, huh?"
"okay, tony. i - i put the - stuffed the geophones stake in, by just pushing on it about - oh - about - a foot. you - y'all better think about that two-tenths cone penetration; it stopped 10. it looks like the 5 would be the best all the way out. i think i'11 just go right up to the hilt with it, too."
how's the tank pressures look?

see you vomorrow.
"say again, 117"
"yes.... time. oh 23 16 08 cdr that's pretty good cooling, isn't it? oh 23 16 09 lmp beautiful."
"and it looked good here, falcon."
okay; good show.
roger. we agree with that.
"ah, you're using it just a hair faster. we'll probably take a couple minutes off the eva, but it's nothing real bad."
"oh, okay. you're right."
okay.
it's not my imagination. everything does float up.

"oh, did you fall?"
go ahead.
"i'll come over there, dave. i put on the other mag; it doesn't work. i think the shutter's working on the camera, but the drive is not."
"and we're gonna change our shifts around too, so i'll be on again in the morning, and then stu'll get it in the afternoon."
"okay, where we are: the low gain antenna is coming in on my checklist, tony."
"okay, i'm reading 8.6."

"roger (laughter). 06 05 58 28 cml° golly. i06 05 59 19 cmp okay, hank. i got a better visual on that little thing we called a cone, and i guess it looks like it is a crater in the top of it. and from where i am, it looks like the southern end of it, which is away from me, probably has just about reached down level with the mare floor. the rest of it is just a smooth cone that sticks up. it does have some small craters on it. the rim looks relatively sharp, and there's a couple of fractures go through it. its texture and albedo do not look significantly different than the mare around it. there is a little expression of perhaps a subtle depression around the eastern side of it that looks like it might be a little flow characteristic there. i'm going to shift my gaze down to these other two features, and i guess - my guess is i really had those things reversed. they in fact were shallow craters."

"and the big news around houston today concerns the astros. in the sports world, the houston astros rallied in the ninth inning at cincinnati to dump the reds 7 to 4. going into the ninth however, things looked pretty bleak. :the astros were trailing 4 to 3. then with one out, jesus alou stroked a single to right field. john (goss net 1) tape 47/4 edwards hit another single to right, and sandy valdespino hit a double tobring in the tying run. julio gotay was walked and joe morgan dropped a bunt for the game-winning play. a wild throw to the plate allowed another run to score, then a sacrifice flyby dennis menke brought in the final run. they really came through in the ninth."

wait a minute. get the safety locked.

"jack, just to ease those words i said before, we looked at the schematics here a second, and you'd be dumping urine out of that same line as that waste vent, and that would probably cause the pressure to build up enough to slow the 02 flow. and we noticed that the 02 flow is climbing back up to where it belongs. lm2_ well, that's clever. okay."
better let her drop a little more. it's a pretty heavy pull there.
"roger, joe. understand."
"and, let me tell you, this is quite a rover ride."
"*** what i'm looking at is the - northwest *** gatsby, where there's a very, very concentrated block *** on the inner wall, except where there are on the southwest three streams and on the northwest and north a continuous stream, if you will, on band, radial band, of mantle that is bur - appears to be burying that field, overlying and mantling the field. we got stonepretty pictures of it, i think."

"man, oh man."
roger. understand.
"say, ron, this is houston. and there's no more scheduled o_oital science photos. we can't seem to run down farouk to see if he has anything up his sleeves. _nere are a couple of passes with black and white coming up; one next rev, and then a couple just prior to tei. cm_ okay. looks like what we've got left here, as far as i can tell anyhow, is just - we've _ot all of magazine papa papa, and maybe four or five of them on november november."
i'll give you a call.
"houston, i don't think there's any hope for using this leveling device to come up with an accurate level. it looks to me as though the cup here that the b-b is in is now convex instead of concave. over."
that's the bottom.
huh?
"okay, copy. csm weight is 37679; lm weight, 36630."
okay.

i remember that now.
how're you doing? okay.
okay.
okay; stand by for a mark on t-2.
"okay, you want to call p61."
"falcon, houston. looks like we need to do a verb 96. you're doing - going through an integration loop."
"yes. head towards that track area there, anyway. there are a lot of boulder tracks coming down from the blue-gray rocks, bob. we'll see whether or not we're going to get to those tracks at nansen, or we might want to move over to the track and see if we can find the boulder that made them."
i was just collecting in this area.
"that would be an awful thing, wouldn't it? go for 4 days without comm and trail in there to the second at ... 5g.... the sext stars all up. is that on that pad?"

these will be the lm. you got all of them?
that's affirm. you want to read those out?
"hold it up just a little bit, pete. lift it up just a little ... better there. there you go. 04 22 47 _0 cc pete, will you confirm that you have the steres- camera over in the sun?"
okay. i got to take a look and see which one's shorty.
"for a 380-pound guy, that's pretty good."
"gordo, we - don't have any contact - comment. all three of my teams lost today."
"okay, hank. thank you."
"we're in - we're in good shape, ken. we're down a little on the flight plan, but we're riding 168 above the above the red line. we're - on the flight plan, we're down a minus 133."
"okay, joe. i guess i didn't see the same thing that dave did - and - talking about the intensity, i guess that's a very subjective thing. but i guess the analogy with the flashbulb ... was very good for the brighter intensities, and it seems like there was - there was one flash maybe that was of ... an intensity in the majority of the ..."
okay.
we got one back there.
"a is off, and the light remains off."
... a check - copy that.
huh?
and do you have an up-link for us before we start in the p577
"yes, i am. instead of going straight down the hill, it curved into the hill."
"it's right exactly - this is a very small crater, houston, probably about 3 feet in diameter and looks like it was made at - not very fast-moving or energetic or heavy/ projectile. yet, right in confidential, the middle of the hole is some of these glass- covered rock fragments. and, on some of the other rocks that seemed to be rested in the hole, i'm putting them all in a - sample bag 1 here, i mean - some of the others don't have any coating on them at all. i'm picking them up with the tongs, but i can't tell how strong they are but they don't seem - they don't seem to hold together too well; they seem kind of weak. there you go. now, i'll head on over where pete is."

open.
"okay. ail right, houston."
i maneuver now?

"houston, eagle. for your information, we're doing the glycol pump check now."

"okay, i'll go in."
"okay. this is on the pan camera photos. when you want to start looking at something, look for a small - okay, just to the east of abul wafa, there's a small crater. about - oh, he must be about 2 to 400 meters in diameter. and he's got a black strip right on the western wall - going down - going down the western wall of the cra_er. it doesn't look like the strip extends beyond the rim at all; just down inside the crater wall. also next to a - now i forgot where i was."

say again. yes. okay.
"okay, bob, as far as any of the things we talked about trying to see at the surface, dynamics or a variation of the light mantle, i think you've heard it all, there isn't much to say about the dynamics right now. i have a feeling that the surfaces are old enough that all those kind of detailed relationships have been obscured .... is just about the same all over here, it varies, but there are no systematics that i've seen."
"and, ron: that terminator crossing comes fairly close to the burn, so you might think about - if it looks agreeable to you, just go ahead and we'll use that as the burn attitude. you'll have to get a new p40 trim to take care of the gimbal offsets. so you may see a slight pitch and yaw attitude change."
"okay. right under that about 151:02, delete all that - that block about the lunar horizon. in other words, starting with the little block with csm checklist all through - right on down through ""set 0mni d."""

"charlie, charlie, let me do this."

"houston, how do you read?"
"we're in a pretty good right roll, tony. about 5 to 10 degrees right roll, and climbing up a steep - steep slope. and, john, here's a great ditch right up here. it don't - it might be a crater. just right in front of us about 20 meters. why don't we stop there?"
"go ahead, houston."
"and, ll, _his is houston. a little more infor- mation based on our snalysis of your last sps burn: ;itlooks ilke you got a good solid bur_ there. we show.94 psi chamber pressure and it looks like the sps is e nitely oo. over. 01 04 39 )6 lmp good to heer it."
"okay, and do you have an opinion on what underlies the sculptured hills?"
"roger; honest (laughter). o! 13 37 02 cdr houston, let me read you this cryo tank configura- tion, and you tell me if that's what you want for the sleeo period."

"houston, looks like maybe we ought to start dumping out of the waste so we can dump out of the potable tanks. it's still leaking and we've got everything but the check valve between the potable tank and the chlorine nozzle isolated."
"see him, john?"
"roger. you have it, houston."
"okay. i'll go over it again. i'm on descent 1, now and fuel is about 64, and oxidizer is 65, and i'll go to descent 2 - -"
it's this one right under here - you can't - no? there you go.

"yes, good idea. mine's in the station."
"okay, geno, and how are your hands feeling?"
very good. i've got it.
018 - 018.
"are you busy? i'm sitting here looking at a couple of questions that they wanted to ask. _s.d whenever it's convenient for you - i'm not sure just how busy you are right now - and just keep in mind i've got a few questions to ask you on the traverses, and give me a call when you're ready to talk about it. lmp-[_4 okay; we're suit - unsuiting, ken. let us get unsuited, and then we'll be back - be back with you."
"and let me know when i can have the computer, please."
"okay, houston. this is __uerica. i've _c,_ pligh% plan change for you if you're ready zo copy."
okay. down a little bit.
"pan camera power going off. 0b 19 24 24 _ okay, houston. beginning the fuel cell purge - 02 ·"
and - -
"okay, i'll crank in these. get that gdc set up. 007.5 ··."
"okay. had nv headset off here, and i wasn't paying much attention when aos came."
"roger. that's a normal indication. that eliminates that as a possible source, so you can go ahead and do your verb 40 and recover and go back to cmc control."
you read me?
extra sample. l_°-eva are you a mess!
"ron, i had the meatball all the way. jack, are we going to have some nice boulders in this area."

"yes. yes, yes, i see it."
"okay, i maneuver to the moon check attitude; at which time i put the 36 window line on the moon, and just prior to ei, the earth will occult the moon."
freaking checklist isn't nothing.
... 05 degrees.
wow!
houston_ this is america. that was frame 145 to 150 on magazine oscar oscar.
i don't think - i don't want sunglasses.
"hello there, houston ...."
"auolio 16, houston."
"yes, let me get that - -"
"okay, would you like for me to return it to zero with she switch in manual this time, just to see if you get that glitch?"
your consumables are fine.
okay. where is it?
"okay, don. can you see any picture yet?"
you have it.
yes. okay. they'd like that brushed away. and you can give me a call - -
"okay, tony, how far do you want me to close the hatch?"
"okay, now. there we go."
"dave, which of the upper ones have you touched now, r both of them? 05 20 54 28 cdr-i_ yes, that's the only way we can get to them right now, joe ·"
okay.
they didn't tell us that.
mark.
okay.
"as you, i'm sure, understood. '_ 04 12 26 49 cc dave, while you're sipping your - cold tomato soup there, was the black rock that you called out to us on a crater rim?"
"of course, we don't want to, but if we have to, i guess we can. okay. let me start this pan."
roger. }laveyou effecthvely established ptc in the opposite direction then?
"there's a lot of noise so we can't hear you vei%_ well, but - - 07 09 13 13 c_,_p - - ... pitchover or something here."
roger.
"that's right, jim. standing by."
three minutes and a half.
"when you do that, you get the cmc guidance."
no. i want to be safe (laughter).
"no, i don't think so. i can't imagine why it's really a problem anyway, because we got the bypass, on, there, and that heat's not going anywhere."
stand by.
"apollo 11, houston, you're go for pyro arm. 08 02 15 19 c_ thank you, houston. 08 02 16 36 c£! apollo 11, houston. your command module pres- surization looks mighty fine to us. 08 02 16 41 lm2 looks good here, ron. 08 of!16 46 cc and 11, houston, i've got an update for about four items on your entry pad."
"okay, bob."
"okay, we'll close the repress 02 . what the - okay, ... place for a valve."
okay.
"bags are a pain, aren't they? okay."
operate; she started at 42:12. okay. recorder's on; radar is on. go to work.
"did you get some flow there? o0 00 ko 5k _ a little bit, yeah. 00 00 40 55 cml° okay, i may have ... in ... a little long - -"
...
... kind of surprised me there.
roger.
"go ahead, houston."
i'll just come down and stand on your side. 06 01 13 08 _mp-eva on my side?
that's deleted. 09 21 55 33 _ that somewhere down there - -
copy that.
"11, this is houston. can you discern any differ- ence in color of the illumination, and is that an inner or an outer wall from the crater? over. 03 05 15 34 cmt_ roger. that's an inner wall of the crater. 03 05 15 43 tjv_ no, there doesn't appear to be any color involved in it, bruce."
"roger' i.h:_[;. 03 23 22 514 lmf and }iow do 3ou re,ad, ,lee?"
good. 00 00 06 if cdr pitch 2 is on -
"yes, i did. there it is, right there; 60.5 by 8.9."
"okay, houston. we'll wait on your cue then."
"dave and jim, the science input now is that we want to forget that large block entirely. we want a- as large a collection of smaller frags as you can get us, and you'll probably be working near the rover for those."
good work.
"we were dig - we're on it right now, babe. i'll tell you."
"okay, ready for 2-3, _nd step 2, you can scratch the first line about ""if l_ is to be acti_e_"" et cetera. and, just the priic evap ""flow 1, open."" that's step 2, now. 07 23 25 0_ lmp okay."
stand clear of the treadle.
okay. thank you.
"lo mult. drifting. okay; looking good. perfect place over here, john. a couple of big boulders. not too bad."
"this is one of the better visuals i've seen, dick."
"we'll think about that, bob; but, offhand, none of us can remember doing anything like that."
yes.
"okay, ron. pressure reg a to cabin. verify it rises."
"15, this is houston with an update for your procedures for uv photos."
"okay, translation control power, on."
"well, that's what i hope. 06 00 09 26 i_mp-eva dac's off, tony."
i don't believe that.
we got them all.
"yeah. except this is the first time to move the boom, and i'd like to move it. but i got to have the flight plan to see what time - go ahead and finish your menu. no, it's on the other page."
"well, good night, robert."
"f_tares, houston. no state vector updates are required. c_;er."
that sounds like a good fill.
"well; we're reading it both in the checklist and flight plan; bravo 2 and delta 2 are the ones to use for spinup. cm2° yes, you're right. okay. we got - we're reading the wrong ones, i guess."
"okay, i'll get it."
"understand. the new line added above ""x-ray, on,"" and it'll read ""x-ray, off, i second; then."""
roger. we lontt want you to get ir%o another p52 before we hives time to talk abous i_. 02 0c 21 10 cmp ail righty.
"we'll be watching you. 00 01 22 3_ cmp hand controller, not a ... control. okay."
yes.
"hey, bob, that's a good point on the thing. those weren't exact times and, as matter of fact, we looked - kind of looked away and it was about in - you know, somewhere around that - that period of time. we looked away and when - when we looked back, it was gray again, so - next - -"
"apollo 16, houston."
...
"okay, 1/250 is that setting, and i'll take pictures of the ... let's see, that's ... 07 09 14 46 i,mp that's the back part, ken."
"roger. 09 20 03 28 cm3 you know, houston, it's also interesting to note, that the - the range of color, from this altitude and from 60 miles, doesn't seem to change at ail, really. in other words, the same impressions that i had of color in the 60-mile orbit are the s:_e impressions that i have now_ of the ssar_eareas."
"auto, commander. ..dlmlllbl; -!"
all right. can you tell me where i should start?
"better put them on, for a while; pull them before you get out."
80 at 5. minus 3.
i understand.
"hey, jack, don't lock it."
"real good readback. no problems. got a consumable update here for you on rcs update. we're right on the flight plan: we've got 56 percent remaining. and the 02 and h2 are basically right on the flight plan and we've got plenty remaining - no problem on that. and for the jack - for jack, for the lmp, i've got a special flight plan update on your crew option photo target on tsiolkovsky. would you like to copy that?"
i'm afraid you're right.
yeah. three feet a second; 2000 feet.
"go ahead, 16."
okay. go to egress. okay. let's monitor decay for i minute. imp okay. i'm about 3.7 - -
"okay. we're going to vent the battery - the bat compartment again, it's 2 and -"
"okay, will do."
"that's correct. okay, let's flip to page 2-2 and strike out the first two lines."
"verb 22, enter, 3, enter, pro. now, i want to enter and pick the first star. right?"
you got it.
need a b_mmer.
"we have a good comm check with me. no, i'm sorry; we don't need that. commander's gone to plss comm."
uh-oh.
okay.
but we'll second it from the crew.
"hey, why don't you turn up a little of that lcc cooling? i'm not - i'm getting hot, now."
"no. i - i think - now i tried it - purposely having at least, say, a degree mistrim and - when i would switch, and you'll get the transient, but the bell will - will steady out. now, i think going ahead and flying it in rate c0_d is - is acceptable; however, you are - you are getting the bell oscillating, and you are putting, you know, the currents through there. this atti- tude - - 08 06 56 14 c_,_ okay. i get the - sounds like - if you could - you could damp the rates - damp the oscillations quickly by getting it into rate command - i mean the - auto and then use the old thumbwheel proce- dure to change the pointing accuracy if you aren't pointing in the right direction. 08 06 56 _4 cc yeah. you - you don't have much control with that - with that thumbwheel in - in the auto. i think, probably, i would take it in rate command, go back _o my attitude, recycle my bmags, uncage them again at my - at the attitude i wanted, and then accept the trim - the mistrim in the - in the gimbal and - and let that damp out. i think you're going to be hard put to try to guess - guess your thumbwheel setting. however, let us think about that a little bit; and, also, i'd like to say this has been checked. i talked with north american this afternoon. this all agrees with the hardware evaluator, as far as our charac- teristics, so i think we're pretty close to your spacecraft. 08 06 57 39 c),_ okay. that's outstanding. sounds like you guys have done a mighty thorough job. my first choice then would be to - i think, based on what you said right now, just do the natural thing and take the oscillations unless they're excessive, and look - just download in the normal manner and ride it out."
that's right. you always find - -
okay.
"and then, needlelike black crystals in it, too."
roger (laughter). 06 oh 03 52 cmp next thing you're going to want to know how it came to be there.
*#* check.
"houston, apollo 11. over."
"challenger we have a good word from the old pro- gram managers even though you guys were pretty piggy there in bringing rocks back, we're going vo let you keep them all. you only busted the red line by 40 pounds."
i'm sorry; geno.
okay. i'll put the old - -
here we go. gosh! this thing take off.
"and, 16, i've got some block data, tei-65."
"*** we copy you, commander, and your feed water pressure is looking much better now, and you're probably getting cooling."
okay.
"when you get dust on the rcu, you cannot read the 02 quantity."
"hey, you guys have had some real winners there. don't change a good thing."
roger.
okay. that's got to be it.
"yes, that hydrogen thing, it's - i'm not sure, but i think it's a backpressure problem. if the thing sees any baekpressure at all, like when the bag is attached, well the flow rate will slowly de- crease to where it's almost zero, and you wait, and you wait, and you wait for that last o,_uce. you think you have its and you remove the bag, and then you very rapidly thereafter see maybe a glob the size of a dime or a quarter come out and just hang there. that appears to be true even though the opening into the bag is not restricted."
... 08 20 21 32 i24p yes.
okay.
"hey, jim, what did you do with those tissues that were over here? remember?"
"endeavour, endeavour, this is houston. roger. that appears to be the problem. stand by and i'll see what we want to do. do we -"
"yes. i thought you checked them all, jim. sure. check them all. sure."
"oh, probably - 6 inches worth. yes."
high.
"standing by for an ems mode, normal, ... - - age96 confidenti.'i,l"
roger.
"well, you've got one - -"
i think they've got our - -
say what? 08 20 17 lb imp were you listening to your recorder last night?
"okay. i got the same problem on the chuck, houston. i think the - the rock is so tough that the chuck bites into the core stem and just won't release it without that vise."
there's a good sample for you.
okay. i'll go run get it.
yes.
bet you at least l0 pounds must be the scb. __ / 05 07 l_ 32 cc (laughter) you collected a lot of rocks out there.
"the one that was down - _nen it was up, he was thrusting -"
... do you want me to take that picture?
aquarius_ houston.
a minute -
"wheel boy, when you do this and you go downslope, that first step is a long one. i'm having - this is the best way for me to travel. uphill or downhill."
"for some reason, we're breaking lock. have we gone around the moon?"
"here. let me get it for you. cdr-_ wait a minute. i didn't get it. no, there it is. okay, i've got it. okay. we going at the same time i've got us marked."
"okay, you guys, you better start ... out your belts, because they could get in the way."
"yes, i see what you're saying. and - it all - almost looked to me llke it was gradational, as you, - as you went away from the crater. in other words, more - more orangish - more orangish closer - closer to the crater than as you got away from it."
"okay, verb 01 noun 01 enter. 17 - 1173 enter. 21 enter."
"and, 16, you can delete charging battery a after the burn; it's charged sufficiently."
"go ahead, aquarius."
"at 56 minutes, slew fdai number i to pitch equals 17 degrees rather than 16; and, at the top of the next page, ensure fdai number i pitch equal 14 degrees rather than 13. over."
"aquarius, houston. we'd like to have apt omni, and we're going to lose contact with you for about a minute here while we try to establish tracking. and our latest data shows that your closest approach to the moon is going to be 60 miles perigee. over."
"well, - -"
"what do you stay in here for? if they don't have the high gain, there won't be no reason - well, maybe they'll get us on a 250-foot dish. i've lost my glove - no, there they are. '_ere's yours? you got your gloves somewhere?"
"i'll tell you one thing about that - that sextant business, don. we got so many particles off the lm out there that i don't believe you could recog- nize a star pattern - in the telescope ever, but they show up just perfect in the sextant."
"hank, according to that theory, it sounds like the hardest work i've done in this flight was lift-off."
"houston, this is ron. while we're getting dark adapted here, probably won't see any for a while. let me just record on the tape my impression of these light flashes as they occurred around the moon and at other times. in general, they've all been essentially - just a - as - as it says - a flash, with a - with a little bit of a glow, and usually in one eye or the other eye. and for some reason, most generally, they've been kind of - if you - you don't want to say it's in - it's in the periphery of your vision, because you get the feeling that maybe there was a flash over to the left or down to the right or something like that. but you don't get a distinct impression as to where the flash came from. well, you can - you can see where it came from, but not - you can't see the flash itself. like it was just beyond your vision. most of them have been like that. at one time and one time only throughout the flight, i can remember kind of a triple flash, so to speak. and in that case, there was a bright flash in the left eye on - on - about l0 o'clock in the left eye. and then it repeated itself again about 2 o'clock in the left eye. and then about, oh, l0 o'clock, a quarter of the way out, in the right eye. i just got a bing, bing, bing, just like that. three - three of them right in a row. and the rest of the time, though, they've all essentially been single flashes to me."
... here ain't on.
...
"oh, look how easy it isl okay, service module - -"
"say, america, aoout 30 seconds to los. see you next time."
"i'm sorry. little out of sequence, there. here - *** collision. (laughter)"
"apollo 15, go."
"copy that, good enough. thank you."
okay.
"hey, look. we can always disengage the real - the rear steering."
that's only 2.2 foot per second.
okay.
roger.
"yes, you need a reinfo - forced toe section."
"0k_j. 04 17 38 38 i24p pga is 4 8 and coming on down. houston, we are ready to start our watches."
roger. i'm right up with you at step 6. go ahead.
"go ahead, vance."
i hope i won't ever have to do that.
good boy.
"but you can look at me for a while. 10 12 41 03 cc yes, you're there."
"well, if you're going to do anything - -"
that's affirm. it was 0.6 and now it's down to - we been seeing it as about 0.1.
okay. 05 23 31 21 lg_p-eva okay. dac's coming on -
okay.
okay.
"no, it's manual."
i don't. i feel like i've been here all my life.
roger. inboard.
okay.
"0.5; okay, 0.7. pag5e66 izj'*"
"suit circuit relief, auto; verify?"
stand by.
roger.
"hey, you give me minus-x - start that whole p20 thing again, hank. tape 113f16"
"roger. and, ron, on the checklist on page 2-6 after the 16-minute ""end of test and proceed to next test,"" we'd like to turn the dac off at that position."
"i'm sitting in - i can't tell you, i'm sitting in volts right now."
okay. and this is a 30-second.
"roger. ,."
roger.
can you reach the feedwater for me? 05 11 10 51 i2_p yes. okay. just a second. let me - 05 ll 11 05 i2_p okay.
we'll pick up an extra minute on the next one.
okay.
"that a boy, and i'm glad."
the backup crew copies.
okay. panel 380. suit circuit return valve to closed.
"that's the way to play it, though."
"no, no, no. it's when you move it - when you move it."
and it's number 426.
"hello, houston; yankee clipper."
"okay, karl; where are the corrections?"
i don't save a hell of a lot of gas. that system was iow when we started.
"okay, i'm in vox. vox sensitivity is max, a is t/r and b is receive. okay. you can open your breaker and connect to the plss comm. houston, i guess you heard that."
charlie has 3.95.
"oh, is that ever pretty."
"that one's auto. 04 23 06 h8 lmp okay. let me look at something first. okay. plss 02 and press flags may come on during repress; if plss 02 less than 10 percent, manually control cabin repress to maintain positive pga pressure. forget it. okay, lighting anunciator and numerics, bright. 0b 23 07 10 cdr wait a minute, easy. there you go."
say again?
"in a few minutes, we'll get aos here."
"well, there are, indeed, little particles flying along with us."
"question number 2. near spur crater, you found what may be genesis rock, the oldest yet collected on the moon. tell us more about it."
okay.
okay; understand.
you want - you say you want to go ahead and try it without - without the - without the loops? what do you think?
okay. go ahead. 06 07 26 b0 cmp okay. pan camera photo pad for your 151:50 in the flight plan. 06 07 26 h2 cmp go ahead. 06 07 26 lb cc okay. it's 151:57:1_ for t-start. t-stop is 151:58:27. over.
"roger, america. this is houston. you're loud and clear. 07 16 58 21 cmp-cm okay, gordo. got my suit on."
like if we can't get it zipped.
"yes. bat c, up around 36.5. pyros, 36.9, 36.9. r. tape 19917 lp l0 17 33 cmp ... okay. fuel cells are looking good, too."
give you a little cooling. how's that? closing at about 4.
"hey, man ... okay, that was a -"
"(laughter) pulled the top out of the mesa blanket (laughter). okay, houston. i'm about to deploy the old uv here. the guy that invented velcro didn't know his - his own strength. *** get this blanket back."
"houston, how do you read me on vox? over."
"roger; i copied, charlie."
"yes, we understand."
0k_. i'll still need the - plenty of time to get the cockpit squared away for rendezvous.
"we're in the process of a little suit donning here, and we've got one problem. i went to retract the mass spectrometer, and the gamma ray boom came in fine, but the mass spectrometer boom indicates to barber pole and has stayed barber pole about 10 minutes. i went ahead and enabled the jetts. and i'd like for you to take a look at the - at the - telemetry talkback on the boom, and see if you can suggest something for me to do."
"i read you loud and clear, orion."
damn! you always seem to take it bad when you do an alinement.
you wonder why it's hard to get up the ladder.
"roger. out. iconfid %. i 04 22 42 19 _ i'll doublecheck it, bruce, but - i verify it's closed."
"i'm beginning to, i think. #** got a water flag. #** hot. stand by. ###"
"(laughter) no, i haven't. let me try. that's a good idea, though. i'll try that and see what i can come up with on that thing."
"okay. t-start time, 141:54:01; t-stop time, 142:18:24."
- - the lower one while i get the upper one in.
burning.
"stu's working on it now; i can hear him. hell, we can open the hatch, anyway."
"apollo 15, houston through carnarvon. over."
"and, vance, we're counting down to midcourse-2, we're up to, in our checklist, to minus' 6 minutes to go."
.... 56.
"they won't _ell us apart today. we both have red stripes. have to mush today, charlie. 06 21 hl 12 i2_-eva how about that? _,_on'tgo down. okay, it's down."
what?
but they've got to be lava flows running down the side of that mountain there - -
okay. let's - -
"okay. they're nice and positive, aren't they?"
"okay, karl. and we're looking okay up here. getting ready to do the gegenschein calibration."
"i can't think of anything really outstanding. we're just right now coming up on another charge detonation; however, i think i mentioned that the lcru is ""kaput."" so, we won't be able to watch it. we're looking at the seismometer traces here. other - i'll come back with any other words to update you on yesterday's report in a little bit here."
i can get that - i can get that valve myself right here. see there?
i 'm taking a pan.
mark's pretty happy too.
that looks good. that looks good. hold that heading.
okay.
"yes. jack, try a little higher. see that one right on the - right there. right -"
"roger, we copy."
and there's a beautiful little rock track here in - it went in a circular arc.
...
"true, that's true. and we're at 192 - at 192 at 1.9. hey, john. right, babe. look at that! hook a right, please. get this old pickachur [sic]."
"okay, dave. great. and you just gained about 2_0 more days for our subsatellite, something like that."
"yes_.going right for weird. head right for the big boulder. then, weird's right beyond it."
"thank you, gordy. and we enjoyed the day with you. see you tomorrow."
"yes, right."
"okay, houston; endeavour. you've got high gain, auto, and i've got the pan camera power, on."
"columbia, houston. you can undock at your con- venience, correction, jettison at your conven- ience. we would like you to jettison eagle a_d stationkeep - in p47 and stationkeep, and we'll have another attitude and a maneuver foc you so we'll be okay for tei. over."
"great. 00 01 55 51 _ okay, ken, i guess you can call p15."
"rot control power, direct, two, off."
"boy, there's a big block over there."
"that's o.7 still, gene."
roger. copy that. 04 17 43 o0 c])r-lm circuit breakers are configured.
okay.
"okay, from zero, you're on number k."
all set. okay. you saw what difficulties i was having. i'll try to watch your plss from t_der- neath here. apollo 11 air-to-ground voice transcription (goss net 1) tape 71/1 04 13 39 43 _p __llright. _e backup camera's positioned.
"go ahead, ed."
okay. 121:27. roger.
that's very nicely done. that's about - 22 min- utes. which is just about what we figured. you went back and looked at all that stuff. so that's just about right.
"roger. and when we come close to the right time, let us know when you're ready to start, anrjthen we'll let you know when we're ready. 02 il 50 '35 lmi' 15; roger."
"on row 2, flight displays, open thrust, open mission timer, open range/range rate, altitude/ altitude rate, and open the ac bus a range rate, altitude/altitude rate."
okay. just a second.

let's ...
one.
"okay. excuse - there we go. okay. see what i'm hung up on, charlie?"
"so do i. i might as well have stayed at the cape. okay. let's see. core bore neutron flux, and i'll get the drill and i'll go back and ..."
"okay. okay; turn around and let me check you. you're okay on this side. let me check the other side. you got a couple dangling, too. can you bend over, john?"
"at 7 minutes, ***7's your angle, 26 - ***7; that's _ great, 106 - h-dot's slightly high, but okay."
average g.
"roger. and we see the shadow of the lm. 04 14 o! 48 cdii roger. the little hill just beyond the shadow of the lm is a pair of elongate craters about - probably the pair together is about 40 feet long and 20 feet across, and they're ?robably 6 feet deep. we'll probably get some more work in there later."
...
if you can get the lights -
roger. go at 3.
"what do you suppose that is? 05 12 42 02 _ hey, we can't - here's something interesting, houston. hey, it looks like a surface - what we got is what looks like kind of a semiburied rock. hey, there's a small piece of it over there to the left. see it, pete? we'll be able to catch it and put it in the bag."
"yes, that was my fault, gordo. i screwed up here."
"oh, yeah?"
just going to have to repeat it again.
"go ahead and take it. i don't really need it to - to drive. 05 14 23 10 cdp, i'll go over and cut that baby_, and we'll - over here. okay, houston; i know that - we did not men- tion this white layer - down in this area before - that was so obvious to us just below the surface up near the flank of cone. but: it appears as though it is - quite a bit - well, itts relatively deep, as far as visual observation is concerned. and certainly not any would be kicked up by foot-prints, or by tracks, or the like. appears to be some of that here in this trench. ttconeiden;['."
"wait, wait, wait, wait."
"roger, al. the information on uv photos is to follow the procedures - okay - you want the attitudes - the procedure's on page 3-352, and the attitude to be used is 210, 242, 322."
thank you.
"gene, looking at our plot board, you're directly over the southern tip of africa or just slightly out in the indian ocean there, according to our plot board, which isn't exactly accurate all the time. but shortly you're going to start going backwards on the earth here and head back across the atlantic. that ought to be some sort of a first. you cross the atlantic twice, going from west to east, and then, now you're going to cross it going from east to west here shortly. all in a very short span of time."
(laughter) you'll have to get it down to my level. tall guys areall alike.
"okay, ron. the next couple are really down in the lower equipment hay area, and then i've got one area up in the tunnel - two areas up in the tunnel that are suspect areas, and then that does it. which would you like first?"
"roger. and then going down to 153:_6, we'll delete shield on."
"okay, ..."
okay. now careful when you turn around. you've got - ...
i think i know where we are too. if i can just look at that map.
give me a few.
"jack - this is aquarius. i'm not to_ sure h_,': long or with what force the venting is going to do to our trajectory. however, you might kee_ a check on that. it may have been going on fsr some time."
"casper, this is houston. we want narrow on the s-band. 4"
"the czar is brushing his teeth, so i'm filling in for him."
why you doing it again?
"_ad, you'll exit ptc prior to that - just put that ilajust ahead of the p30."
roger; copy. stand by.
"oh, thank you."
all the blocks look very much the same in the wall of horatio.
"magazine bb, 85 percent."
okay. turn it on 2.

"no, not at all - -"

"you have to have the 02 flow on, that's right, babe."
"okay. noun 33, 110:27:55.00, and roll, pitch, and yaw as depicted: 0, 105, and 0. right?"
okay; i'm parking east on a level slope here ....
"okay, i'm still on a tight dead band."
can i close the covers?
i just put it there.
"i'll take a look at it. i'm going to tighten it down so it stays, then i'm going to take a look at it. i mi_t turn this thing down too."
"roger. looks like nell is coming in five-by there, ll. mike, see you in the background. the definition is really outstanding. the colors are good. it's a real good picture we're getting here of commander armstrong. we - buzz, when you take the camera over towards '_the window where the sun's shafting ' through, it tends to blank it out, though."
"man, oh man, it's taking a long time thinking this over."
roger. plus .10975.
"did you? 03 23 06 15 irp yeah. 03 23 06 29 irp okay, we got it."
"just a second, pete."

okay.
"- - john, while you're still out there, we'd like you to confirm that the dac camera is turned with the battery towards the sun."
"bob, the first block i looked at here looks like subfloor gabbro."
"well, it looks like our big bag is empty somewhere in here."
"a cb(16) co_: se audio, close. plss pt ... maintain right, verify. a plss mode, a, wheel counterclockwise."
"houston, endeavour. can't seem to get the mass spec boom all the way in and i guess al's had a little trouble with it - now and again with the barber pole being half - the talkback being half barber pole. and seems to flutter there, close to the gray position, and doesn't really come all the way in."
"well, that's the way it'll be, because it's already punched."
"unbelievable! just think, just the little bit- tiest ones down there we can see are going to be our crater. hey, there's one with collapsed sides over there. see it?"
"oh, okay."
roger. a little closer this time. (t_q)
... diverter ...
kind of like our suits.
roger.
"pao is down there with ""well, the boys are in good humor up there"" (laughter). oh, pao, you look at this dse tape, you're going to kill me. how are you doing down there in the world of advertising?"
okay. noun 22 again. i'll go ahead and torque them.
"well, that's it."
"limit cycle's off. 06 15 01 2h lmp rate, high."
"oh, that lec came out of the bag in three pieces, and, as you would well imagine, i picked the wrong piece."
"okay. i'm going right now, if i don't fall over, i can -"
"not for two revs, charlie .... tomorrow ... full thing."
"gordy, no. but it's conceivable i could have been keying the intercom. ! don't think so, but it's certainly conceivable. i - i checked everything else around here."
"aquarius, houston. 04 01 41 20 i24p go ahead."
"oh, hey, there's one that'll look good, the dark shadow. you can see a lot more."
okay. thank you. (columbia)

"okay, go ahead."
i wish i could 6o back and make that landing about 6 or ? times so i could take in all that i missed.

"okay, fred. i can just barely hear you saying something in the background and i can't make out what it is."

"get the pusha-button, huh? okay."
"loud and clear. houston, intrepid. how do you read?"
"... firing it, john."
"where's the bag that the - that the - the good old uv - hey, charlie, did you throw my camera away?"
"okay. pre - pdi switch setting. vhf antenna, forward."
"limit cycle, on?"
"roger. take - take a look at the peaks and con- centrate on that mountain in the center of the peaks, if you will, ron."
"okay,"
"0kay; copy that, gene."
"yes. when we get over in this area, i'm going to ... this ... check-- 06 00 46 50 _ here?"
that'll be fine. i don't care.
yes. i think - i think we ought to head just about - -
okay.
okay. we'll do it.
"houston, america. when you get a hack on - on our track, i'd like to get a first-cut estimate at it."
roger.
... fails if you move.
"hey, tony, we're delaying slightly. the buddy slss bag was working loose."
"okay, karl. understand you want me to go back to normal dap load and normal weight."

it's moving.
"except for - move your wire, jim."
"hello, apollo 11. houston. we've got some sw[tc?i positions for you for the high gain. over. 02 10 19 33 _ okay. go ahead."
yes.
"roger. we copy. 03 09 26 53 lm? charlie, apparently there just doesn'l seem to be any slow way to get that repress tc auto without making a big bang."
i guess we can take those off. i don't know whether we ought to or not.
"okay, i'm reading you 5 by, casper. how me?"
"i don't know if it'll mean anything to you, but the shadow of the lm, the rendezvous radar antenna is pointing about one-third of the way down from the peak of family. and that, i know, is pretty gross. and, gordo, i - i must be right here abeam of trident 1. the only reason i hesitate is that i'm so close - but it's probably, well i guess it's close to 100 meters - 80 meters anyway - to where the - where the rim of trident i falls off. and i am abeam of the center of trident l, and that's the only possible thing it could be. and that would put poppy just about where i ex- pected it to be."
"no, it sounds like you all thought it out. i appreciate your letting me know about that. i think - is the time line worked out good enough in there to work in a p41? i guess it does - an hour before, huh?"
we won't ln_owuntil we get vhe high gain here at 21_

"and, houston, ed batteries check."
"okay, we're spinning up right now."

"question number 8, again for ken: what were your impressions of the back side of the moon, and were there any surprises?"
(laughter)
okay; suit circuit's about 7.2 now. should be coming off the peg shortly. i'm off the peg.
"okay, you got your hand controller locked, but it's armed."
"apollo 15, houston. over."
"okay. what do you want to do now, get the hasselblad? 03 /2 18 01 lmp jim, you're all right."
"yeah, ken, i think they're gonna have fun analyzing that one."
"okay, in this attitude, jack, that we're pitching around, i cannot use the aot to see stars. we - we're just not able to see them at all. now we may be able to maneuver off in yaw or - and/or roll and see stars. right now, we haven't been able to. the aot is useless. the command module structure is just radiating too much light into the - into the telescope."
"okay, houston, 2:30 - in the blind - we're still go."
"okay, jim. that's a good readbaek, and in the event of lost comm, use the procedures that i gave you. it may be that between now and tomor- row these procedures will change a little bit, so we'll go with what we've got now, and stand by for something better if it comes. over. f 03 15 19 28 cdr okay, jack. i'm looking at your burn pad and i see that the ... total gimbal ... 19.3 feet per second."
"how far is the lrv, charlie? well, we've gotta get our plss antennas up."
"about 5 min - 4 and 1/2 minutes to los now, ron. we went around the room, and all systems look good and you're just looking great. cml° okay. mighty fine, i'm feeling pretty mood."
"- - and jim, you may be coming up on a mag change, depending upon your frame counts."
"yes. see, otherwise - stu'll be suiting, and - you probably can move a hell of a lot easier with that suit on - without those damn things on, too. okay. okay. how you doing, stu?"
mark it. it's on the way.
okay; relay bus bat b is open - coming open. _-_ getting around to battery charger. bat charge to alfa and then to bravo. both about 30.
"roger, gene. okay, it must be about time for f/8 and 1/250."
"sure. i'm sure we can, joe."
"well, we're there, now."
"yes, but how are you going to keep all that stuff out there clean."
okay.
let's take it; we'll need it.
it 's chips.
"dave, you're loud and clear."
"and, jim; houston. in particular, of course, _,'e don't want any translation maneuvers."
you reckon you'd have one of the photo guys down there to figure out when we could get a full moon with an 80-millimeter lens.
"negative, jim. we don't necessarily know that. as far as we know, the data looks pretty as a picture. we just want your own feel for it."
zroger. looks like a real smooth joinup.
"endeavour, this is houston. go ahead."
"looks like a vesicular, very light-colored porphyry of some kind; it's about l0 or 15 percent vesicles. i'm right in front of the lm. they - quite a few of the rocks look of that type. sort of a pinkish hue to them. the texture is coarse, but i'm not sure how crystalline they are, yet. okay; back to work."
jesus christmas! you ought to see the dsky.
our water.
"okay. copy that, geno."
"rot control power, two, off."
yes. 05 22 16 37 lmp-/24 we'll breath it down.
okay. serv0 power is off.
thank you.
"16, houston. we're starting to see a high tempera- ture in the subsatellite battery in the sim bay, so what we'd like to do is go ahead and close the waste stowage vent valve now and get into ptc as soon as we can."
"okay, dave. go ahead."
the src doesn't have to be all the way closed does it?
"aquarius, houston. over."
you're not gonna trim.
"there's no level - there's no level spot to park, here, though."
yes. let me - 04 17 46 07 _p that's fine. can you get - reach everything now? okay. stay right there. itm going to help you. $onfidenttaijlw
okay.
"okay. my procedure, now, after service module jett is going to be to pitch up, in order to try to get the service module into the - to get the center window in view of the service module, which we are going to have somebody there - to photograph. why do you think window 5 will be it?"
how about giving me an ags update?
"yeah, charlie. slow down."

"and the rover boys at hadley rille have just had a tremendous session picking up all sorts of useful samples. the tv has been beautiful, the - all sorts of layering shows - in the - in the edge - in - in the - in the rille walls, and it's just very exciting."
roger; copy.
okay.
"yes. they're really - everything is really tied in the original theories on the structure and makeup of the valley. everything seems to be fall- ing right in there, and that's what has - has the whole crowd of scientists around here really smiling. let's see - let me find out what's next here. okay. it was strangway's turn next, and he didn't have any results to present, of course, because he's got to get the tape back first, really. however, the orbital sounder - the command module sounder - when they made the pass across the site with the transmitter on - no, i got it backwards. when it was in a listening mode, listening to the ground transmitter's signals, they found that the signal was in exactly the frequency range that it was supposed to be, and they - they picked up the - exactly the right sequence rate, once every 0.8 sec- ond. and when they calculated the power levels, that we were putting out just exactly the 1 watt that we were expected to put out. so that - that everything looks good as far as the operation of the transmitter, and without going into all the details which you know as well as i do about the thermal problems on the receiver, they're still - well, he sums it up, we have no reason yet to be sweating it too badly. they're very hopeful that when the tape gets back, we'll have good data on at least some of the legs, and they're - they're waiting for you to bring it to them. dick kruse is here, and he mentioned that all your pains, geno, in brushing dust off of it probably saved the day. if it's there, it was just due to that, that it did work, because it was really on the ragged edge here."
"okay, it should only have done that - did you reset at the beginning of the 15 seconds?"
"well, i got it the best i could. let me get the top of your lcru there."
"we had to do so much work around the - the rover, there's hardly a spot that's not - messed up."
"when you're ready to copy, 11, i've got a couple of small flight plan updates and your consumables update, and the morning news, i guess. over. 00 22 51 55 _ apollo 11 ...."
okay. we've got it.
okay.
okay.
okay. --_
still no reading on the motor temps.
"15, this is houston. if you'll give us accept, we'll send up a new state vector."
"okay, that answers the question. we couldn't tell from the tv whether it was the visor or the sun- shade. that's fine. we also heard some discus- sion about possible wear in the seats of the suits when you were dusting each other off. we want to know if you could see the - any hint of the alu- minum layers showing through in the suits. over."
"rate/err monitor, lmp, - landing radar/computer."
"wait a minute on that, ron. we're havink a debate whether we want to, maybe, continue the next mart in the same attitude or just rotate it."
there you go.
do we have another eat period before tv?
okay. we'll continue to make that assumption. thank you.
"okay. this test is pretty gross, so it doesn't really hurt anything. this is for my rate gyros."
charlie's getting the after on that soil in 368.
h-dot's 4 high.
"getting into areas that resemble, in their surface texture, the sculptured hills of the taurus-littrow landing area, here we're just passing - now where are we? - that would be (laughter) i got disorien- ted all of the sudden. proclus is there, so it""s in the ray-excluded zone of proclus where there is a mare surface projecting up into terrain that looks like sculptured hills. and that mare has a distinct bluish-gray color, in contrast to the regoiith associated with the sculptured hills - between the hills at least - which is a brown - let's call it a tannish gray. quite a sharp color hue contrast tomy eyes, at any rate."
...
"houston, based on the burn yesterday, is the data you gave us for the sps burn card still going to hold for loi?"
"now - and get your camera on it, because i don't - i don't have it - any film. how about this one right here that looks like it has some layering in it? maybe."
look at those big pieces floating around there. o0 05 48 11 _ - _ that just dropped down.
how are you doing?
enable.
"how come you're taking 24 minutes to track it, and i'm only taking 8 minutes of pictures?"
"okay, select."
you can bet we're not going to leave anything.
"a little darker now. let's see. there's my star right up over there. yes, that's -"
"okay, i got it."

okay; i have 60 hours.
i'll give you a time hack on the get at 75 hours 37 minutes and i'll try that bias at about a second and a half to allow for the time of flight.
did somebody in the background - do they accuse us of being compromisers? huh!
"okay, al; we understand. high sun angle may have made it difficult."

and the x-ray is on.
okay.
"endeavour, this is houston. ready to tag up with you on the tei procedures. and, dave, i guess we're standing by for your rec_mendation. do you want to read through the additions you now have in your p40 sps thrusting checklist, or do you want us to go through the changes we want you to have there? it looks pretty much exactly like your tli maneuver. there're just two changes; there're two differences from that, i guess. over. r_"

"okay. let's see, we owe you an answer on what to do with the levas. i guess they were supposed to be on the helmets in the pga bag. is that going - to be a real pain to get at, and put them there?"
master arm is coming off.

"okay, ron. that - that completes the visuals on this pass. we - if you want to look some more, we've got some time. we do have some flight plan camera pads and all that, but no hurry on any of it."

okay. i did - i fixed it.
"roger; at 46. looks like you gonna make it. and you might keep an eye on the middle gimbal angle on this thing. we're gonna watch it, too."
"okay. one of the items here has to do with reentry - with entry stowage. we'd just like to verify, or have you tell us about any changes that you're making relative to the normal stowage, that is, in accordance with page 2-17."
we do. we just want to put them on 00.

it's coming in.

"okay; and the reason why we're doing this is the cabin is coming up a little bit and we're going '5oopen the waste stowage vent valve for approxi- mately an hour. so at 154:30, we're adding ""waste stowage vent valve, open."""
e_ss and this thing are right together. couldn't be any closer.
"roger. houston, this is neil. how do you read?"
"okay. starting at delta-vy: nlus all zeros; 0h0k.6, 0517.0; plus 057.1, nius al! zeros, plus 001.3. over."
"well, let me get a piece of this glass."
"we copy that, pete. you got the nominal align- ment."
"okay. here's a note that i'm not sure i understand totally, but let me read it to you. ""observe tar- gets through viewfinder and shoot as desired with polarizing filter in different positions. mark exposure time with polarizing filter as data analysis requires the incidence angle."""
"okay. the next step is 247 plus 45, ""x-ray to standby. _'_ _-_"
"15, this is houston."
the only big one over there - only big crater over that way would probably be earthlight.
"still a little bit too much, but that's not bad."

"ok_, geno. we copy that. 07 16 19 26 cdr-_ 0k_f, gordy. on the radar test, everyshing is go. everything is within limits. the only anoiaaly is the one i just reported."
"okay, jim. the latitude is minus 021.62; i i_ave a correction on the longitude - minus 165.37. go ahead."
he doesn't know the difference between you and me. he keeps calling me you and you me.
look what 's underneath it.
"ok_r, that's a good one to know."
okay.
"on this - on this event timer, charlie, i got 04:16. is that right? 09 03 33 50 _ that thing ain't working. no. can you see the sunsight, ken?"
is stan serving coffee to you?
"okay, lift-off - - apollo 17 air-t0-ground voice transcription"
what?
probably.
main b - - 01 06 40 27 _ go ahead.
"okay 17. challenger, we are ready for jettison."
"okay. our first question here on the portable magnetometer - i forgot to re - i forgot to ask you. it was my omission. i was wondering what the temp label on the - on the electronics box read, if you remember."
"that's really just the line temp, by the way."
"- - to the - right there, let's see - no_ i can get them. the thing is, i don't know what it is."
okay.
"okay. retrieve purge valve, verify closed, and lock pin in, and lo. delta purge valve in red. 05 21 52 h6 cdr-lm okay. 05 21 55 07 lmp-l_4 okay. purge valve is in, and marked, and locked. 05 21 55 13 cdr-i_ okay, diverter valve's on vertical."
"okay, a little change in the priorities. when you get back to the lm, we'd like the _qfturned to look at the m_sa area, so we can watch the closeout, number 1; and then, you can shoot a quick picture of the solar wind."
imndwe're standing by for lift-off minus 10.
okay. we go to po0 in about 2 minutes.
okay. battery b relay's breakers in. charger's off.
"that - that's - the pallet, the pallet -"
screw around. i got to go back up in the lm - in the command module and take a leak. i'm going to disconnect from my comm and come back down here so i can get down here and look out this window and motor around a little bit. 03 17 39 17 _ ...
roger.
"i'm just coming on. did you happen to take a look at that docking latch? okay, i've just been told that's all squared away. so i don't - don't know of anything that needs to be done now before you go ahead with the integrity check."
"okay, ron. lunar sounder operate to operate. we're all set."
but don't kick dirt on this - -
"oh, that's too had."
"hey, gordy, as far as the food, medication, and sleep goes - no medication. gene had 5 hours of good sleep, i had probably around my usual 6, in spite of my poetic inclinations. and the food - we continued to do well, i believe. we've eaten a wet pack apiece last night. we got one this morning. we've eaten our scrambled eggs and sausage yesterday, and as we've run out of juices and tea. and which is somewhat of an inconvenience i might say. and if you've got any specific ques- tions, i can fill you in on it but, i think, food- wise we've done pretty well."
and i have you visually opposite the bright star.
copy that. how about an amps reading? we haven't had one of those for a couple of ... _- lmp-eva starting to rain again. got a crater ahead of you.
... with the dse tape.
"okay, i'm up on the time, i guess. see what else we've forgotten."
"endeavour, this is houston. over."
huh?
i think that's what we're doing. it's pretty - we - we got a little depth-size problem here and i think we'll figure it out here in a little bit.
"okay, lcg pu_p -"
"just like the simulator, huh?"
"roger. your attitude will be roll 12 degrees, pitch 270 degrees, yaw 0 degrees. high-gain antenna angles, pitch plus 14, yaw 263. over."
yes.
"charlie, i guess we'd just like you to leave the sunshade alone; let's - just let it hang there. 05 02 19 01 imp-eva i got it. it was wrapped around - a couple of times. i didn't touch the little bit level. it's okay."
"mount camera. i need to get the camera out. ,./! mimll"
"well, got to have a little stick time."
let's see - -
"loud and clear. 08 06 48 27 c_ okay, houston. the gyro torquing angles on the p52 option 3, with the star angle difference all balls, minus 0.032, plus 0.001, plus 00, - plu - excuse me - plus 0.034. and that was at a get of 198:24:35. and those angles were so small they weren't torqued_ because we went into the option 1."
"okay, charlie. you've got 6000 pounds of thrust pressure .... think it makes any difference."
"okay. one minute to cover close - uv, that is."
ncger. kilo-kilo hasselblad mags. 05 !1 33 ao i_{p yes. 05 11 3h o0 i2{p i've got the closeuu c_mera turned on. is that a__i the plugs? age -18 tonfidentiat'!i 05 11 3h 07 cdr there's one more hasselblad back there.
"roger, dave. we copy - copy your comment loud and clear. we're receiving you clearly. we agree, we don't have anything from jim yet, and we 're looking at it now. 05 21 35 53 cdr-i_m ... 05 21 36 17 cdr-i_m ..."
"yes. and the crater. a shame not to - well, maybe that's the wrong one. i'll have to check the map. a shame not to go to station 1. sure is a shame. why don't you consider station i as a possibility? okay, bob, let me give you some numbers."
it's in work.
that's right.
"(laughter) yes, man."
"john, it takes those little bumps - oh, it won't take that one, but it'll take those little ones just great."
"houston, lm/cm delta-p is 0.2 again."
"we got this great big filter floating around. why is that floating around? 09 05 _9 3_ lmp i'm sorry, dave. i'll throw it in the diaper bag. 09 05 b9 36 cdr gee, jim, we got to make another burn. 09 05 _9 39 lmp yes."
i'd ...
... let me close the hatch. f:o.nfidend!till. - day 6 page 403
"there's blocks, but i don't see any concentrated outcrops - -"
"okay, jim. understand you have the pad. sps/g&n; 36363; plus 0.61, plus 0.93; 192:13:33.30; plus 2799.7, plus 0609.5, minus 0098.0; 181, ll2, 0.15. rest of the pad na. ullage: 4 jet, 12 seconds. over."
"(laughter) you know, the - the most natural thing in the world, the safest operation you can ever think of, is go to po0. and what happens? the platform coarse aligns."
"and, 16, you can have the computer."
"it's going pretty good. we have about four dif- ferent methods of spreading catsup, right now."
"both hf and vhf look good, and we saw no visible interference on the csm telemetry."
"houston, will - will not the - we want to make sure - we want to make sure we knock the dust off those connectors before we take the caps off of them."
copy that.
roger.
yeah.
"okay, that's the jett bag."
"what's your vhf reading, ken?"
"i like the ones where i can push them in, joe."
got it; i almost got it.
okay.
"okay, 11. houston. roger. it sure is. eecomm is anxiously awaiting his big moment here for the logic sequence check whenever you're ready."
okay.
"hey, this crater isn't as steep as we thought, pete."
here's the interconnect bag.
"we want to get a dump prior to the uv work there, ron."
... turn that way .... try the other way.
...
enter.
is any of that tan or brown?
yes. p ge onfidential .... 04 13 _3 04 l_ - - maybe the 15-degree inclination's going to do something to it. i just always imagined it was right in front of us.
"do those blocks look like gabbros, you guys?"
"looked like it was going a million miles, but it really didn't."
"hey, jim, we had to turn on our window heaters for about l0 minutes per side to clear up the windows - right aft - right before undocking."
oh.
"don't get it out to look, but i just wondered if you remembered."
"there's a lot of water in those hoses. hey, houston, you read intrepid? 0b 18 38 10 cc intrepid, roger. we copy your comment on water in the hoses."
"okay, houston; falcon. how's the p63 look?"
"okay. oh, i guess i need to get another film mag, huh?"
"okay, jim. copy that - -"
"roger, jim. coming up on our tec partial gamma ray extension, and looking downstream towards that, we are requesting that you time the gamma ray boom extension, which you're going to do at 219 plus 19 - and we'll be standing by for that time. and also requesting - that you get on the biomed via the flight plan, please."
roger. we can do that now.
"we copy those, jim_ thank you. and normally, i guess, we'd like those in the postsleep period as opposed to presleep, which is when we got them -_ yesterday. i guess it's in the checklist that way 02 01 28 00 _ okay, we'll - okay, we'll normally do it that way."
not that i know of.
yes.
okay. at 3 minutes. 82's your ball number. *** still looking for the right altitude. so h-dot is -' high.
"yes, i guess i ought to put it to use when i start cycling on the cryo fans here shortly. you know, we - actually, we have plenty of time. i could put that 105 lens on again and take a colored picture. 00 01 54 33 cml° yes."
huh? can you get to the maps?
okay. we'll put it in ags. (tranq)
yes. i'll get it.
i'm looking at 118 degree:; of ?itch.
okay - -
"wild, isn't it? f"
"man, it's hard to see that -"
"hey, you want to take a look at this b-b and see what you make out of it? 04 15 04 30 cdp, i find it pretty hard to get perfectl_ level, too."
"okay] wait a minute. let's take ... 02. something's screwball here. look at this. give me that lox card over there, pete."
"hello, houston; endeavour. loud and clear."
...
... the command module.
thank you. where am i going to put that land- marking track ... this stage? ...
okay. we'd like to give you a little weight summary for the rock boxes. if - we estimate you probably got about the same in rock box 2 as you did in rock box 1. no problem there. the surveyor parts and tv camera will show a nominal 25 pounds in 15. what you could put in your bag that goes on the floor is about 15 pounds worth of rocks.
(laughter) okay; and - -
question 6: you've had a lot of equipment trouble during this mission. is there a common thread running through all these problems for which you could suggest an explanation?
"because you didn't want them to get moved inadvertently, i guess. it doesn't matter, jim, they can be out or in in terms of powerdown. they just don't count."
"i took about _ more pictures on the 500, joe, looking __ out at silver spur and the blocks that are exposed up there."
it's about - 3 feet. you want to move it farther than that? how far do you want to be? i'll pick it up and move it.
"copy that. we're ready for a bias, gene."
"okay, that's good. we'll take a look at it awhile _d let you kmow when we want power off."
"can't see that needle anywhere. can you, al?"
"hello, there. how are you doing?"
it's the only large - real large -
"okay, fine. 02 06 52 35 cmtv houston, we're going to open the direct 0,_ valve and start pumping up the cabin."
"you have about 3 inches left there. 04 20 46 24 i2_p well _ it - i-_was no proklem getting it ia, al. it's _z fingers won't reach a_ny further."
"roger, columbia. here we come with the teill. sps g&n: 37200, minus 060, plus 047. noun 33, 098 05 2422, plus 41448, plus 03719, minus 02422. roll is na, pitch 020, the rest of the pad is na. set stars are na. the ullage is two quads - (goss net 1) tape 54/4 correction, two jets for 16 seconds; use bravo and delta. in the comments, the undocked present csm- correction, this is for -tei ll is undocked. present onboard weight of the csm is 37200 pounds, about 50 alfa on your dap. over."
outstanding.
all right. i'll make a note of the canister and remind you of it later. f--
"okay, jack. 03 23 ]1 34 cc aquarius, houston. over."
"(singing) it's raining, it's pouring. well, i need some music to dump urine by. l oayn pagehs? day ll"
"okay. now, get out and make the double core tube here."
"okay. on panel ll, we'd like you to close the lgc dsky circuit breaker. then we want you to go to activation 25; do steps l, 2, and 3. then go to activation 30, and that will give us a docked imu coarse aline. over."
"just stay where you are, and put it in min deadband."
"pyro arm, two, safe."
"they haven't been able to level it for some reason, and they were afraid that the thing wasn't level. they were hoping also maybe by moving it that you might jostle it a bit and it would come to level, but i think we'll just have to think about it some more. the first presumption - the easiest solu- tion was to have it unleveled, which case we could fix it this way. but i guess that's not the case. we'll have to see what happens overnight. give us a chance to follow the tradition of coming back to the alseptomorrow."
"read you loud and clear, gene."
"that's the problem, you weren't in both, huh?"
"houston, we're preparing for the gimbal drive check."
taking some close-up pictures of that rock.
okay.
copy.
i didn't - i didn't realize we wore you out.
to the northeast.
yes. let's do. i think it's going to be the sa_e - -
"okay, jack. you're loud and clear. the background noise i've been mentioning, although i guess you haven't heard me mention it until now, is what we expect in downvoice backup and low bit rate. how have you read this transmission all the way through? over."
"okay, jim. we're getting it intermittently. we think we might get it steady and improve circuit margins if you would, in addition, on panel 16, open the primary power ampl circuit breaker, and i'll give you next step in a minute."
"0kay, houston; apollo 13. i think we've got high gain locked up now. do you confirm?"
"okay. okay, houston. how do you read on ...?"
"far_, on."
okay. i took all this - extra film and ...
"okay. go ahead, pete."
"dave, you're driving towards 1.8 clicks; 088, bearing."
"roger, geno. cdr-i_m hey, ron. i ma_ have to take back what i said. that thing i thought was an antenna is nothing more than your eva light out there. c_ (laughter) okay."
i've got - i've got two whole reels of color stereo.
"okay, 21118."
"yes, right there."
"houston, do you copy casper? 02 oh 03 oh cc read yo_ loud and clear, casyer, go a?_ead."
"well, it's not quite that cold in here, but there sure is a difference."
"you said 4 miles long, is that correct, houston? (columbia"
"oh, yes, you can dump it. i had to take the pallet out to get the tcu off."
roger.
roger. you got it.
all the pressures here look good.
"oh, excuse me."
"okay. comment number 1: use nonexit ems pattern. comment number 2: ret 90k, 06:01. ret mains, 08:26. ret landing, 13:17. constant g is roll _ right. and the last con_nent: get moonset, 304:16:14. over."
"it's going to be earlier. 00 02 02 44 lr_ yes, a little bit earlier."
"okay. well, that's to be expected, i guess."
"hey, pete."
"what do you see down there, al?"
"got a big rock there, too? *** you know, the thing that amazes me is that there's no subfloor around here."
okay.
"houston, eagle. (eagle)"
"stand by l, houston."
aaah. tape94/41
"yes, i need ... other charts here."
roger. cdr-_4 okay.
okay. sounds good.
go ahead. i'm going to run back in.
"go ahead, houston."
affirmative. pull them both out.
"t-start, 130:18:05; t-stop, 130:19:16. over."
- - speen should be lo; off.
okay.
it's probably going to be a bagful of soil when we get it back.
okay.
"rhc power, nop}/.al,too, ac/dc. 03 09 52 35 67gp ',}kay."
and we'd like frames when it's convenient on you guys.
"i saw it before it tumbled the platform, though."
"ph, roger, apollo ll. we got you going to a posigrade attitude and we want you - this burn will be using minus x thrusters at about 2 or 3 feet per second, and we got a load for you. we'll send it up momentarily. over."
"not too had, fred."
which shoulder?
- - aboard now. looks like you really put some weighs on our suspension system when you loaded it there.
how's the old green team this morning? did you have a quiet night?
"hold the bag. this big one, this one. no, the other one, the other one; don't."
"okay. you ready? 04 08 12 22 _._p yes. 04 08 12 50 ia_ okay, it looks like i got it, dave."
"i can probably work on this thing by myself, if i - darned umbilicals. age l ayl"
go ahead.

"okay, houston. ed bats a and b are 37.2."
"okay. v over h, high altitude -"
verb 76?
"i've got to get down at 5 here before i can turn too well and open the hatch. i'm going to let it come down a little bit this time, so i don't get down there unnecessarily. yes. it's got a ways to go yet. about 0.3 now. 0.2."
yes. _--_ cdr-eva rather than trying to chip.
okay. coas goes up. yes.

"okay. and, 17, houston - how's the dusting coming?"
"oh, yes. 'j'here'l]be somebody to be standing by, they'll run up into the bedroom and tell me to stop what i'm doing."
stars.
okay. ttold on a minute.
"yes, yes. i can't see over there, but - -"
"okay, dave. this involves delaying the sim bay turnoff until 238 hours and 30 minutes. and in detail, at 238 plus 05, delete the p30 external delta-v, and the verb 49 m,aeuver. lines: at 238 plus 20, delete sextant star check; at 238 _ plus 28, delete all the steps from there starting with circuit breaker scs, et cetera, up to 238 plus 55, ending with rhc power direct (2) - off, et cetera. over."
"okay. okay, let me just get the other two pan's, pete. be finished in a minute."
that's verified.
understand. we have it.
worried about that.
"okay, i've got my suit on and john's going off coremand getting his suit on."
"the old water bag is working super. this is going to be a good day, charlie."
no. they'll hang in there for about another 47 hours or so.
"yes, we did. okay. there is already one on the gate. *** one there. okay; scb-7 to gate, *** commander's - camera, we'll do it when i get back - 20 bags on the lmps camera, core cap dispenser to gate - there's one there, there's one under the seat - short cans under the lmps seat. i got to put that cap dispenser on him, i got to get my rammer, hammer - hey, bob, what bag do you want on the lmp? do we have 8 here? *** it'll be - -"
okay; p00 and data. you got it.
okay. t-start for the solar corona is 166:52:45.
"yes, it's all open. all set."
"lblsalt, 3.6 tc 4.3."
thank you.
that's correct.
standing by for enter enable. 01 06 40 46 lmp/cmp enter enable.
"we show you about south of the - southwest of the crater jansky right now. 03 06 31 28 _ smyth sea doesn't look much like a sea. it - the area which is devoid of craters, of which there's not very much, is sort of a hilly looking area. it's not like the maria at all."
oh me. oh my.
"thank you, joe. i think you are more than a casual bystander though. 05 02 27 23 cdr-i_ hey, joe. we've got - i and b - or correction, l's replacing the 3s and 2's replacing the _s on the plss."
i'll use this black ...
"bob, the walls of these craters, the big craters around here, that is, the ones that are, say, 15 meters in diameter, tend to be a little bit lighter albedo than ones down in the m_ntled area. i'm afraid those pictures on that rake m_y be a little bit made - be through a dust-colored lens."
"roger, al."
"wait, wait - sharp crater, that's funny; i can't locate it."
"that's - ail that's verified. (t q) t.]_ 04 18 52 51 cc roger. thank you, and i hope this will be a final _6 _ good night."
"okay. ed mitchell - ed mitchell must be working now. i was just about to ask you for that. and for geno, one reminder, you will have to switch back to lm/cm delta-p in order to read the delta-p. over."
roger. copy.
you are go.
3.8.
okay. i'm just starting p20.
"we're moving right along, houston. we're ***"
"yeah. for 2002, change the w-matrix."
*** it is. right there?
okay. thank you.
"roger, jim. the first one is at 53 hours exactly, and it's just a note for your information."
ed - ed this - you - you guys have been loud and clear to us every time on your uplink regardless of the dish.
it's on.
902 34 47. (rri q)
you were counting the seconds; i was watching the clock.
okay. we concurred with that. we were talking about it last night. we're going to approach it from the side.
breathe through the canister.
yes. get a shot of home.
"see here, charlie, when you get under the dirt, it's all white."
"ail right. now, just hold it right there. hold it; hold it; hold it. one - that is - two. okay, let go. ail the way."
"mode control, att hold. 03 23 26 12 _ aca/jet 4, disable."
"i think i'll - the footing is _ll right, except that you have to work pretty hard - to get back up, so - i think what i'm going to do - -"
"got a bag? bag 568 is a fragment from the surface. that's a corner, i think, off the block that gene documented here."
okay.
- - this in the bag. that's right.
"hello, aquarius; houston. how do you read?"
are we on mike now?
yes.
"and i'm copying down the reestablishing - ptc maneuver that charlie gave me. step 5 was, ""when rates are less than 0.05 degrees per second, attitude control yaw to pulse."" and just how am i to get my rates down to 0.05 de- grees per second. my - my rate indicator, at the best, is 0.1 of a degree."
"when it comes time to change refsmmats, to go to the entry refsmmat tomorrow, i've been thinking about our - our funnies that we've seen with the cdus, and when we were looking at that one this afternoon, it in - in some ways hinted that maybe we - maybe we didn't have all that d to a and a to d stuff working the way it ought to. would there be any advantage of - maybe someone could think about it tonight, maybe they already are - but is there any advantage to doing a pulse torque to change refsmmats tomorrow instead of by the usual procedure of using the coarse align."
"okay. how do you read, now?"
"lm power, 104."
"okay. c nfidenti ., ji"
"yes, that ought to do it."
okay.
"no. i - i was trying to move too slow, i think."
you hold - just hold the handle.
"okay, the solar wind is in there now, joe. solar wind, penetrometer drum. etb."
i haven't trimmed in roll.
"as far as i can tell, you guys are right on within a minute or 2."
] believe i would have expected a difference.
"okay, ... tv bracket."
(laughing). that was always my problem.
"right. do they - do they look like very similar areas, or are there some contrasts there?"
"okay. just don't let me get that cover. okay. say, why don't we close the door? 07 o0 02 46 lmp-i_ yes. 07 o0 02 55 _4p-lm prim water, closed."
okay.
i can do it anyhow.
i'll say it again. it's the one in the sleep checklist. you'll get to it at - you get to it down here at about - at about 2b:10.
"no, it's terrible over here."
"roger, jlm. 06 0h 25 47 lmp-eva did i index it after the last one, joe?"
"great, bob. i was - you had me worried there for a while with the comm. do you have a good idea what caused that?"
you're getting close to the end - we ought to - -
all right.
"charlie and i both saw you. that's a good data point. we been asking and nobody has the answer. you can't see it through the coas, but you can if you look around the side."
yeah.
okay.
okay.
"look out, ticonderoga, we're gonna hit you."
yeah. that's what it is. 07 01 03 22 lmi°-eva i don't -
"somewhere, i lost the ring sight that goes on the tv camera and the hasselblad. and it's probably wherever i put it. (laughter) but, unfortunately, i just don't happen to know where that is. i guess that's really the only piece of operating equipment that i've misplaced. well, that's pretty good, considering the shambles that this place generally stays in. 06 o1 51 53 cml° it's really puzzling. i've been sitting here - one of the reasons i'm not saying an awful lot is i'm trying to get some kind of an idea in my head as to how you describe the differences between the front and the back materials. and that's really hard. because every time you look for a - an objective thing, you really kind of find that there's a lot of similarities, when you get down to the details. it's not clear that the back side is - would be that much different from the front if we put a few mares in there and a couple of - of the big rilles."
"will now. thank you, don."
roger.
"hey, vance, would you monitor our rates and kind of give an idea of when you think they're stable enough to start ptc."
... nice and close on the inside.
"okay, you can bring on your gimbal motors. number. 1, pitch."
and 34 volts on the charge.
"you know what, bob? great as an experience as it has been - -"
"roger. 06 04 27 15 i_mp-eva okay, i ought to be collapsing the trench sides - i hope. 06 04 27 47 i_tp-eva okay, i'm about 4 inches out from the side of the trench."
"ken, houston."
yes.
yes sir. keep it that way. (columbia)
okay.
"okay. let's, just for the hell of it, take some pictures of that - top of that booster any_zay, huh? o0 02 10 48 i2__ yes, i'm going to try to. you mean with the has- selblad or what? 00 02 10 51 c_._' yes, the hasselblad. 00 02 10 52 cdp yes, with the hasselblad. _fe're supposed to do it only, you know, provided it locks anomalous to us, but i think we ought to just go ahead and take a few pictures - - 00 02 11 00 i2_ yes, z think we ought to - - 00 02 11 01 c._._ oh, yes. i think we ought to t_ke a couple as we come off. and then, when we roll smd it comes in the hatch windowg i think you ought to take a cou- ple out of the hatch window. ©0 02 11 11 cdr have you got a range sight on the car.era? o0 02 11 13 i2_p no, not right now. wouldn't hurt if we did, 'cut we don't. 00 02 11 19 c_ yes, i gct myself all strapped in now. 00 02 11 28 i2._ okay. asa 64."
fit - will that fit on the camera though? will this piece go onto the camera? 01 08 20 19 c_ i think that's the same kind of connection as on the - on the hasselblad.
"the helium went up; 31, 20. okay? okay, i'm gonna close main sov a."
"okay, go."
let me put a sample in your bag.
"fred, are you ready to start primary?"
"hello there, aquarius. loud and clear. how do you read me?"
"yes. 06 22 05 24 l_p-eva no wonder it was hard pounding. got a rock right in the bottom of the - 06 22 05 b0 cdr-eva might - might clean it off so you get a good seal on the cap, jim. get a good seal? 06 22 05 36 l_p-eva i'm not going to get too good a seal because po - a portion of the rock - you know."
"five by, charlie."
yes.
turn the volume down a little bit.
"okay, jack. give--"
the rover isn't steady enough for you to lean against.
"yeah, but charlie, we can't - we can't get off the samples around - -"
yes. the batteries need dusting.
dkay. everything's going very nicely.
go ahead.
it's going to jump to decrease whenever we pull crossover - -
"let me get the gnomon. i think i can get sc_e of these pieces over here. *** get that 90-degree angular flight line around this boulder, too. lm_d-eva bob, the more i look at this thing - here's the piece that fell off. here's the piece that was knocked off up there."
"boy, that's heavy."
okay.
"we'll be with you shortly. okay, jack. double- check your logic power breaker. lmp-i_i checked."
sure will. wish i could blow on it.
"- - that blue one that i described from the lunar module window, and my bluish color is because it's glass coated, but underneath the glass, it's a crystalline rock that, to me, has the same tex- ture as the genesis rock, and it's not a breccia. at least i can't - the part i'm looking about - at is it's not a breccia - maybe just one big clast. but the part i'm looking at is a one solid - it's an igneous, plutonic rock."
and tv camera'll be aft and down.
"you don't need your - depress with your purge valve, but you don't need it."
"okay, gene, if you can get that fairly readily, why don't you - you can perhaps just scoop it up with the bag."
roger.
"should give you very good performance on descent. 01 00 21 11 i24p we should have a lot more hover time, huh?"
"you know, the thing i - you know the thing i dread most? about closeout?"
"okay. ready for the commander's menu, day 9, meal charlie?"
... always ...
i think that helps out. we can see it better.
"okay, i got to let the cabin go down some more."
... you catch it?
guyot. just to the north and west of king.
okay. here - here's a bag.
"okay, vance, let us know when you're through with the dsky so we can load noun 88?"
"okay. and let's take the - - 04 17 37 20 l_ no, let's get the overhead. i think it would be easier, don't you?"
"yes, sir; yes, sir; three bags full. --_"
okay. we're waiting for the water flag.
"pete, if you'll write the time down over here for each rev, then we'll have it out and we won't have to look back. tell him to ... it here."
"al, this is houston. we still show you're off - okay. you're coming back in now."
"is decaying, the auto's working."
yeah. that's the gnomon stick. see the legs?
"okay, stani by while i check it. 01 06 23 47 cml° okay. we are terminating the waste water dump now."
"apollo 13, houston. the next thing we'd like you to do is to -"

- - but carefully.
okay.
"okay. and, charlie, we'd like to press on with the closeout."
we just got a change on that. let's keep the asa closed.
"fred-o, we've handed over now. how do you read?"
okay.
"jack, in looking at the sequence reports for hickam and hilo and that area, it looks like they just got their standard 3500 scattered, 4500 broken clouds, maybe a rain shower or two. but just their standard tropical fluffy clouds. apollo 17 air-t0-ground voice transcription"
"okay. the crew is complaining of some horizontal banding on their monitor. do you see ghat on the picture? 01 06 59 )5 ct stand by. o1 06 59 14 id_° they wouldn't see anything now. we don't have anythin_ i_ focus, charlie."
"with the binoculars, we passed over langrenus, and you can see blocks on the tops of the central peak, and some features that probably are there that i just haven't noticed before in that central feature. you can see an awful lot of - looks like a - the demarcation where the central feature - looks like a crack in it - has a whole ring of craters that kind of dots that boundary. and then, you see some more of those little craters up along near the top of the central lineament also. and you just don't see those kind of things stand out at you without the binoculars."
okay.

"okay, john. i didn't get that."
"houston, endeavour. read you loud and clear."
"hey, number i just went gray on the lunar sounder."
okay.
roger.
"wait a couple hours, ken, and it'll even get your attention faster. and when all of you've got a chance to listen, i've got a couple of words on the - on the cdu transient fuse [?]."
"john, when you come up, if you remember to bounce - bounce your foot - *** your feet on the struts - -"
"your comm is pretty weak at this point, mike. please say again."
okay. we'll come through with one more picture.

"well, bag 7 is dave's bag. it's on the - the left side. it's just a question of which one you want on the right side. in other words, which one do you want on me?"
over to the right a little bit.

"yes, there it is."
we're showing a foot a second on tapemeter. it isn't closing very fast.
stand by. let's run the lmp check here. -_
okay.
"okay. stand by, joe."
way out there.
"16, we've got a state vector and a target load whenever you're ready to accept."
okay. we need the up link breaker in then now.
"no. i wanted 208. i want 208, and you want 211. iatp no. i'm sorry. that's what i copied down."
okay. i'll get a new prog in and compare your estimage there.
"it's hard to tell at this density and pressure of gas, but comfort level is about the - about the same as the command module."
"yes, you might tweak that up. we are getting a good signal, but go ahead and tweak it up just a little bit."
it's a different albedo; it's amazing.
"we're just about ready to get started, bob. we're running a little bit behind, but - we'll catch up here."
okay. can we skim where the - can we skim where the pristine sample was?
"okay, john. you've got - 5 and 6 are looking good."
"well, i'd say'that the subsolar point shows the greatest change, but you can still - the zero phase point shows the greatest change. but all the oceans get darker."
"no, that's a pretty good theory, though."

thank you. 0_ 18 _5 16 lmp and the s-band cable both - got them both. back up. try it again.

roger. terminate charging battery bravo 51 30.
that's rig_nt.
"i think everything's been put up, here are these scissors; they could fall out. no sense in letting them fall out in the middle of a burn; i'll put them in my bag. everybody's happy with their gear, huh? no pens on the overhead?"
"- - almost 3g's. boy, ems has missed here within about 5 miles."
okay; 42. i got 22. i had the nominal time.
that one won't work ...
"okay, 8 seconds. three -"
i didn't think you were.

yes. i got that. th_n_ you.

"okay. we understand it now, and thank you."
"you're right, henry. 10 2_ 28 c}gp and, if you'll remember that little black dot that we drew on our map and talked about. there's a little black spot about in the right area, and i don't have my map so i just looked out at it. but i'll come back next time and take a look and - sure like it is something - entirely different texture."

...
okay.
"well, i'd get-the other samples - the small ones and particularly soils in the src first."
mmmm.
"okay. and what we're doing here now is, after you have pro and you activate the entry dap, at that time, your noun 46 first digit is dropped to a zerc. to reactivate emi°509, after the flashing 06 61 comes up, letts insert in there a verb 21 noun 46 enter, 30000 enter. and, of course, all we're doing here is putting the 3 back in noun _6 and this was dropped, as i say, when you went into the entry dap."
"okay. that's a good idea. here, jim, i'm going to bring her around here and let's get on with it."
"let me do that one more time. the aft is fine, that's for sure."
"loud and clear, don."
"and, al, when we get there, we'll repeat - repeat step 3, yes."
"stand by. we're talking about it, guys."
yes. t_mp-eva can you fix that at ail?

right up over green. mr. hartmann and mr. green.
okay. which way?
"okay, here's two ... you're gonna have to screw in this thing, it looks like. it's really bad that we have to play with that thing. can you - did we stop it in the attitude?"
"can you read all this, houston? 04 22 43 _8 cc we sure can, charlie. we're following you pretty well."
"okay, houston. got it."

"okay, jack, and how about taking the suit circuit relief valve - cycle it just to open and then back to ab_o."
"well, i don't see any way around it, jim. it sure doesn't seem to be doing much, does it? it won't go down."
that's affirmative.
it'll come out.

"oh, boy."
"two minutes to go, jim."

all right. the burn was nominal.

okay. i'm manual. going to reacq.
just went orb rate.
okay. it looks like it's pretty good bet. i'm going to take some of that out.
"oh, not too - not too hard. watch that turn."
"that sounds - that sounds good, jim. 02 o1 58 30 lamp let's go back to 57:45."
"i can't get down there. okay, we need some of the soil outside the shadow here."

"okay. in that case, we'd like you to repeat the 20-second deploy, 40-second retract sequence twice more and, if gray talkback is still not obtained, we'll turn it off and wait until 275 hours, at which point we'll give you a call and we'll replay - we'll repeat that. over."
it's start.
"go ahead, aquarius."
okay. we got one other item. we just want to make sure that we don't get any uncoupled attitude control after 277 hours get. that's to ensure that we get precise tracking for at least 10 hours prior to midcourse 7.
so do you. i wasn't going to mention them.
roger. thank you. 08 02 54 53 _4p and it's rotating just; like it should bt. thrusters are firing.
i think that checklist is ... 5 minutes and then closed.

how did you get by?
was it a big crater?
"no, i don't think i'll - i can't take pictures and do penetrometer at the same time."
okay.
"it's interesting. you know, i think this looks like that material that we talked about the first day in front of the lm. maybe it runs past the lm down into this area. but it's sure different than where we've been. it - like it's more - the material is more cohesive and forms clumps, in- stead of being so nice and smooth .... around behind you."
you got - you got anything on the tv?
"okay. i understand what you're asking. stand by just a minute. okay. ken, we'll work on that and get back to you first thing in the morning with it. 10 11 00 42 cml° okay. i don't have any strong druthers. i just - i was thinking over the things we might be going through and kind of wondered if that might be prudent if i avoided that loop. but if everybody's happy with it, it's certainly a lot easier to coarse align. 10 tl 00 57 cc okay. we'll take a good close look at it tonight and let you know in the morning first thing. 10 11 01 02 c_ okay. thank you. !0 11 01 06 cc roger. 10 1t 06 54 cmp don, we'll be off comm for about 3 or 4 minutes."

how'd i get by? i used the - -
"yeah, i think - i think we've been very fortunate to do as much of the mission as we have, considering - considering how much we got slowed there. and i don't know whether potassium had anything to do with it or not, but if it did, i'm sure grateful that we were taking it."
...
sequence camera. i've got that son of a gun set so good it stinks. if i can just start it now at the ... moment.
"houston, it's been a real change for us. now we are able to see stars again and recognize con- stellations for the first time on the trip. it's - the sky is full of stars. just like the nightside of earth. but all the way here, we have only been able to see stars occasionally and perhaps through the monocular, but not recognize any star patterns."
okay; and 15 seconds to uv cover close. five seconds.
okay.
okay; thank you. and can you give me a time for passage of vogel?
"in front of the l-shaped bag, isn't it?"
"endeavour, houston. standing by."
"okay, you got these? okay, just hit ..."
roger.
"okay, jack, on panel 11 on the top row, do you really want the propulsion pqgs and ascent helium regs in? 02 12 44 54 imp and, also the syst_4 engineer x- pointer breaker."
i got it.
really?
"okay, at 77:57, there's a group of csm systems checks. move those up to 77:20."
back on again.
okay.
yes.

"no, i can't see any tracks, jim, but i can see discoloration, rather circular, that looks like it's around the lm."
okay.
you want to try it yourself? just doesn't come off. 0k 01 29 3_ l_ have you got another - another towel?

"11, houston. we can make out the markings on the panel. we read system a ascent fuel, ascent oxidizer. quad 1, quad 4. the - it's really unbelievable, the definition we're getting down here off that little camera. over."
think you can reach the - reach this hook that's hanging over here? you might entertain the idea of sending up the second one that way.
"up tft.k_etry, cm and iu, both to block."
you get the landing radar on your final trim.
"okay. i'll go ahead and pack up, charlie."
"okay, i'll sure do that. i'll come in and i'll whistle something here."
roger.
self test is to heaters.
can you see the moon?
"from your description, it sounds like we won't have any trouble finding split boulders at 8. /"
"okay, john."
"and, houston, i guess you saw the landing radar self-test. that came out 4.0."
that's a pretty good sandwich.
"okay. that sounds pretty good. (thanq) oh 12 08 32 _ i guess it's a combination of the vol_uae and the (tranq) antenna. may have been just the voluz,e that was way up too high. why don't you try stowing it again; see if that makes any difference."
"yes, that's the one i had for launch date."
you'll have to start putting some of these samples in my bag. you're getting a full bag for christmas here.
one more coming at you.
"beautiful. okay. now, at about i minute to go but definitely after the light is on, proceed on to the next step, which is verb 37 enter, 47 enter."
okay. i'm not talking loud enough.
"okay, let me get yours. your right one - left one. okay. both of them."
you might want to turn off your plss feedwater when you get all the way in.
"that bag is empty, isn't it?"
how much more delta-v do we need to do it?
"aquarius, houston. how do you read?"
"hey, how about a bearing and range there to help us pick out the lm ... roger. how about bearing and range to help us pick out the lm location."
"okay. crew status is all good; no medication. and i've got the onboard read-outs, if you've got a pencil. l0 12 20 b1 cc i've got a pencil."
"okay. top section, tony, is number 43. pass on."
"thank you, 15."
"okay, dave; while you're getting configured there, we think both your batteries are okay. there is something wrong with the forward steering and we'd like the forward steering switch to off. we still have good rear steering."
"and, america, you're l0 minutes from los, and the spacecraft looks great."
"not doing a thing, except shutting it up."
make sure that flap in back goes below that ops hose.
i'll get it.
"what i'd better do is before i put this thing back in operation, they're going to complete that other canister. i don't know. it should be in operation now .... 03 19 15 05 cf[p ()kay, i[ouston; aquarius. 0_ 19 15 07 cc aquarius, houston. go. 03 19 ]5 12 cmp okay, joe. should this canister be in operation now because it's already mounted on the hose? suit loop to get full flow through there, and it's okay the way it is. what i recommend you do with the commander's hose is get the bag all ready, but not stick the hose in until we call you on it. okay. 03 [1915 39 cmp okay. will do. ob 19 16 45 cmp it won't go around? 03 19 j7 04 cm_ yes. or else a strip of tape."

yes_ we sure do. putting the map away.
"also, be advised the inner ring of the - the basin arabia is quite visible. it looks like there is a - shallow depression outside the inner ring and when you get up at this altitude right around saenger, it is indeed, it looks like a raised-up plateau crossing saenger. and, also, in the vicinity is king - king is almost going into the _erminator now, well, it's 10 or 15 degrees from the terminator. but you can see a little bit of a raised-up plateau, that takes in the crater king and goes about a crater - a king crater - a diameter and a half or maybe 2 diameters to the south, and a crater and a half to the north of king."

"no, that's all right."

yeow!
roger. we pulled the circuit breakers. (eagle )
"how soon before you're going to send up the data, houston? 04 13 49 13 lm? throttle, min."

... and the pink ...
why don't you get the platform ... there we go.

no more than usual.
"hey, houston. this h_mmer - when you hit on the side of it, like you have to do to ... it within this suit, it knocks little chips of metal off the side of the hammer. i don't think that's too good. 05 1326 48 cc roger, al. is it damaging the hammer or the core tube?"

that's nice.
"15, this is houston. we're getting a reasonably good tv signal from you. and, we have about four procedure changes connected with the asa heater circuit breaker coming up at about 34:30 in your time line, and we'd like your choice as to whether i read it up to you as a block or whether you want us to read it to you step by step when the time comes."
good.

okay.

"we don't need dust from the top. if this is a better fillet than the other, you might take a soil sample there, and then a reference soil away, and then a chip off the rock, and we'll have a good fillet sample."
that'll do it. *** poking this water hose here.
yes.

i can get it now if you like.
"six seconds, and it's late."
"okay, geno. now two real quick geology questions that will help us do the planning for your eva tomorrow. the first one has to do with station 4. and you called out some material on the rim there - the crater at station 4 - which looked like bedded spatter. and we're wondering if that resembled things that - that you'd seen in hawaii? over."
"yes, but it says take them. how about that camera stuff back there? let's get that son of a bitch, too. can we get that?"

it is?
did challenger figure out where they are? are they pretty close to - the center of the ellipse?

okay. go for landing.
"roger, houston. apollo 11. go ahead. o0 03 37 '/8 cc roger. could you give us comments on how the transposition and doching went? over. o0 03 38 07 cm? i thought it went pretty well, houston, although i expect i used more gas than i've bee_ using in the simulator. the turnaround maneuver' - i went pitch accel command arid started to pitch up, and then when i put manuai, attitude pitch tack to p_te command for some reason it - it stopped its pitch rate, and i had to go back to accel command and hit what i thought was an extra pro _eed on the dsky. during the course of that, w_ drifted slightly further away from the s-ivb th_n i expected. i expected to be out about 6_[_feet. my guess would be i was around 100 or so; and therefore, i expect i used a bit more c_ming back in. but, except for using a little more gas - and i'd he interested in your numoers on that - everything went nominally."
"that's great. then that is the s-ivb, huh?"
"okay, and, america, once you fellows finish your presleep checklist, you're go for sleep. you're go for los and we won't be saying anything to you when you come around the front side next time around, in case you've nodded off. call us if you wanf to and we'll just let it be as if we're fin- ished with you for the night."

"correct, jack."
okay; understand.
"yeah, we're pretty close."
"okay. as long as it's not on the mirror, it's okay, gene."
"okay, do you need some help on getting in there?"
"yes. let me tell you, you just got to think an order of magnitude bigger than what you're norm- ally are accustomed to thinking."
"wait a minute, charlie."
be fine.
"well, i don 't know what 's underneath it."

roger.
"okay. the first one is at 4 - 148:10, and it's a pan camera pad."
stead by 1 on that.
"that's where i had it, joe. right on top. the __ probe went down a couple, two out of the four."
if you hadn't made me run all the way -
"hey, mike, how's it going this morning?"
i know it.
let's try it.

"yep. 06 22 43 33 l_-eva that is that - that big - i can't believe the size of that big black rock over here. and i don't think that's a breccia, john. but, although it might be. i see some large white clasts."
okay.
can you do that likewise? or can you hold it with that other camera? it's already set at 30.
"i don't know. i wonder if they tried that in the simulator. i can't seem to get roll to go up. it goes down on me, no matter how i hit the controllers."
"besides, gordy, when you land on a boat, all you're worried abowt is that the boat's there. you let the captain worry about where it is."

"off the - ooo, is that soft and queasy. hey, that's neat. i don't sink in too far. i'll try a little - boy, that sun's bright. that's just like somebody - shining a spotlight on your hand."
"okay. it looked like, from time to time, guys, that only one of jack's hooks was hooked. on the top. 06 19 h8 37 cdr-eva yes. they're both on, and they're both tight. and--"
"yes, man."

yes.
"john, can you get the suit circuit return valve open?"
"say again, gene?"
what did you say?
i kind of have the same feeling; it's a bigger day. _-- day 5 page 187
"on the right-hand side of page 25, where you have the title ""solar corona and limb brighten- ing photography,"" cross out ""limb brightening photography."""
but there's no question where those tracks come from.
okay. time skip

"ken, you're clean. you don't have a boom out."
"okay, jack. just for curiosity's sake, does fii)o have any information as to whether that helium - that helium tank dump affected our trajectory at all?"
and i think that - that 0.2 is what it reads when- ever it's equalized.
making sure i don't get any dust on your experiments.
"okay, roger."
"well, something's different there."
"i'm not sure what the first problem is; i c_n give you some symptoms. i put the chlorine in, and when i screwed down on it, it seemed like it was just a little bit stiffer to screw down on than they had been before. but it wasn't obvious that it was that much different; because they're always a little tight. and when i went to take it off, i got a whole lot of water bubbling out from around the - the port. and i couldn't tell where it came from. seemed like it - the first thing i thought of was the same thing that happened to 15 with the nut backing off. and when i got it out, it looked like the - the bubbling seemed to stop fairly quickly, and then i - the first thing i tried to do was to tighten the collar of the adapter down tight, and right now i still have the chlorine injector adap - needle adapter still on the chlorine port. and i tight eped it down by hand, and it seems like it's holding it. the chlorine ampoule itself was broken when we took it out of the in- jector drum. we got all of that mopped up, i wanted to get some buffer in with it - you know, the system, because it looked to me like some of the chlorine had gone in. so i started to try to put some buffer in, and it looked like it might of leaked a little bit. and then i went to take it out - out of the - take the injector out of the adapter, and when i did, it looks llke it squirts fluid from two holes that are 180 apart from each other on the adapter. and i guess i don't know what those two holes are for. it looks like maybe the needle is not going in, but i'm not sure what it is, now. do you have someone that might know how to put it together? apollo 16 air-to-ground voice transcription"
the object is to pull it out of the ground. but i'm not sure we can do that without driving a drill.
"yes. well, you know, we haven't been trenching like we should or we would have - -"
roger. at 53 and 55 delete one line each. go.

"i guess what i'm asking, joe, is where are we relative when - to when you plan for us to come out. you know our mission timer isn't working, so i'd just like to know when you expected us to come out, so we know how to pace it."
()kay. let me see the timeline book. 04 02 09 45 _ there you go.
"then when we - when we scooted out here and you started your nonpropulsive vent, we could see - first, it just looked like it was a little mist around the outside when you looked at the sun. and then the sun hit it at such an angle that you started getting a spectral reflection, and _t looked like a rainbow out over the lm. and then after that, you could look out my number 1 window, and apparently the lighting was just right so that it - it had the appearance of light streaming off to a point source at infinity. there was a little blank spot in it at the - at what looked like the origin. and then all these streaks were coming back towards you, like you were right in the center of a cone. and these things would change colors. they go to a light - light purple, and then they'd haw-_ a little sandy color to them. that was another one that i don't remember ever hearing before, and it was - maybe it was just the lighting on it, but it .surewas pretty."
"and, jim, finally on tae p52, we're considering using the - the moon and then the sun for the fine aline."

"okay. here we go, houston, with the cold fire check."
go ahead.

"okay, ron. while you've got that book with you, i can give you a one-line change to the e-memory load as a result of our changing the short-burn constant."
"okay. good shape, man ... - -"
"okay. you're loud and clear, jack."
super.
my sausage got off my spoon.
okay; we're checking out the command module thrusters now.
"no. no. press on. and, jack, if you look at your contour map there, we think you are located right now at approximately where the p in sep is, , just below the p in poppy."

"al, the best information we have on that female qd fitting is that it would be in the waste manag- ment system backup bag in a-8."

we got the light before we got the bang that time. i saw it. i hadn't noticed that on midcourse 2. she's steady. gdc bmags are good.
"i read you loud and clear, dave."
let's try it.
...
"houston, apollo 11. how do you read on bravo?"

no i c - i can't do nothing with it.

yes.
yes. we take eight with the el.

"well, you could say that. i'm not too sure just what kind of pitch or roll i've got, coupled with the yaw. i just saw the earth go by the lmr's window here, not too long ago at a rather faster rate than we had going the other direction."
ags has exactly the same numbers as the pgns in x and y_ there's a difference of 2 in z.
...?
roger.
because that's not done.
"okay. go, joe."
"it's 30, charlie."
"okay;when you finish the burn, we'd like to get a radar check. 04 o1 23 3g cmp okay. i'll see what i can do."

"yes, go ahead."
"about 4.0, and the cabin is 0.3."
you can tell that - look at the particles flying out of here.
you bet.
i think there's something wrong with that oxygen regulator. the flows in that thing are very unstable.
we're looking at you.
"okay, houston. my circuit breaker's armed - or closed; sequential logic, two, on and up and we're ..."
"okay, joe. we'll be giving you a call."
- - for minutes.
yes.
"- - okay, it might be full-scale high."
no. ron was retesting our bleeper again.
stand by 1.
we'll wait a couple of minutes. it takes that long to settle down and give you a reading on it.
"i was going to give them some - oh, you give it to him."
"in what fashion did you want us to disable those plus-x thrusters? jus_ pulling those appropriate tca breakers, or did you want to actually go in and mask those jets?"
we both like to hear that.
"roger. midpac 000, 153, 000; 290:06:31, 267; minus 00.71, minus 156.18; 07.1; 36196, 6.54; 1051.0, 36276; 290:23:31; 05g, 00:27; noun 69, na; do, 4.00, 02:00; 00:16, 03:31, 07:46; boresight sextant stars, na; lift vector, up; and there's only one change in the comments, charlie. the ret for 90k - do you want me to read all those?"

"well, we got a good one for you, bob. not too good, but - in the midst of other things, we let the waste water go to zero on that dump. as a matter of fact, it went past zero. and the ... is starting to fill up again, and the best we can tell onboard, that - it shouldn't disturb anything, but you might take a good look at it."
yes. let's throw that hit in the box.
are you ready for the decon bags? 07 10 43 35 _ okay. all right. (laughter) no. none of us are going very far.
"you're hooked up on the lec, jim."
roger.
"go ahead, 16."
"okay, first piece of three sections - bob, it's full."
"until they get a collar around this thing, i ain't going to be very comfortable, because my experi- ences with the stable ii egress from this son of a gun have always been bad (laughter)."
"yes, that figures."
...
right.
roger.
give me your left - your right hand.
... that card? yes. let me have the - the burn card.
ok_.
"we'll pul] one out someways, i gu_:_s. we've gotta watch that one right there."
just clean them a minute. there you go - just to get that loose stuff off.
mcdivitt's purse is enough to make - - time skip
"15, we'd like to go to auto again, and go directly from reacq to auto without a pause."
it's taking too long. just take it off. is it off? ... - -
that's ridiculous; how'd we ever get here anyway?
okay.
"okay. we have another inclusion that, on the sur- face, has a more reddish-brown texture. interior looks pretty much the same; it's a very light gray. 5-64 j _ _'_: / !"
"okay, no extras on those two, then - on the vhbw, huh?"
okay. we've got that.
"we understand you're standing by. we want you to stay with the onmli, and we'll be requesting high bit rate shortly."
"okay, good; can you get some pictures of those, too? okay, and i'm ready to start my 360 roll when you get some pictures of those things. okay, i'm going to roll left."
"the difference there, ken, is you - when you're loading that verb 48 for the - the emp 509, you don't pro on that one and activate that dap. 02 19 40 09 cml° okay, i see what you're saying. ail right."
"roger, jim. we - we'd like to have a - a complete check there, and don't - don't reset that circuit breaker, incidentally."
mark it. stand by.
"and, dave, this is houston. while you're stowing the brush there, just thinking ahead; we've got a couple of checks to carry out on the rover before you drive off from the site."
"yeah, i got them, charlie."
"say, bob, you want both the recorder and the - and the other switch off?"
"okay, i had about 2/10."
a little frangible.
"all right, it can't lock, because the handle was bent up above the lock; there's no way. 06 04 41 21 l_p-eva yes."

okay.
mark. barber pole. and it's gray. image motion is on.
"okay, i'll get it, jim. you try and get that 16-millimeter working. you guys have almost lost control on this camera, haven't you?"
you want - you want ... 08 ll 16 06 _ i think if we get in the leb ...
"roger, jim. at 56 plus 50, start ""csm systems checklist, ivt to dm,"" and this is an item that's moved up from 57:20, by the way."
okay.
you're right; we got a lot of pictures.
yes sir - suit flow on both of them.
"okay, hank. i thought 16-3 was to be used only for high altitude. that's kind of a large crater, isn't it?"
"stop, start. ail right. 04 12 42 09 _p it's okay."

yes.
"and, houston; america. you can try that one again."
"sorry you thought i was helping you, but i wasn't."
"that's a very good question. wait'll you drink it day and night for 2 weeks, and - and let me know what you think. and for lunch, too."
"yeah, go ahead."
"stand by, jim. we'll see if they're ready."
copy that.
"okay, your power is up to 4, tony; i mean your s-band agc is to 4 and you're external. i - it was off, i'm sorry."
yes. the horizontal.
"i guess i can turn nryvkf off, since their's is off."
how about some exterior lights for me?
"okay, number 1. and helium temperature is 80, helium pressure is 4100, and the manifold pres- sure is about 100. o0 o0 24 18 i/4p manifold's about 100. okay."
"roger. and then over there on the back of the card. would you give us high gain, auto, right now, al?"
"okay. if you got the 1257, enter, then 252, enter and enter."
thirty-one seconds.
"and pull that - yes, pull that out."
"okay; fine. that's set, and she's working."
"roger. ken, in view of that, you can do that water dump any time you want."
"i thin}: that's where we put it, as a matter of fact."
copy that.
"well, i had just decided ... when we were looking straight down, we were going so goddamned slow, i just figured we were going to fall into the moon."
"that's correct, jack. and now let's go to page 1-6. and about one-third of the w_y down, it shows ""panel 275 cb main a, bat c, closed,"" we want to strike off '_hatline, the next two lines, and we're going to strike out ""main a, bat c, closed; main b, bat c, closed; and dc indicator, main b."""

"you bet you, sir. that's outstanding. .[ _ , z '"
yes.
"okay, tony, our heading was 195. hadn't changed."
"okay; how about taking a look at that mass spec. you - you know where that one is. that's the one in the - all the way in the aft shell, and it's the one towards the plus-y axis. 04 05 b9 58 cdr cover's silver, right?"
... you can come up with them now.
why don't we move it over here to a - -
"yes, it sounds - it sounds like we might have the problem nailed down, but we'll douhlecheek that."
"yes, go ahead."
push sep 1.
not bad a-tall. not bad a-tall1. everything's right direction; very close. 05 22 43 53 ls_p okay.

"yes, it (laughter) it's tightening up again, joe, and i'm not putting any force on it all. it pulls itself down in, and then it starts to bind up."
"that's affirm. i've got some reports for you, if you're ready to copy."
"okay, 100 and let's - 140 - let's see, before i get over there, you want me to - oh, you'll remind me to come back to the shift the dead band. okay. okay, i'm at 171:40."
no.
yes.
okay. i'm in no hurry. it looked like it burned between 0.14 and 0.8 with an occasional spike up to 0.2.
we've got plenty of time.
"okay, houston. nothing worked pushing and i'll try rapping."
"roger. our attitude according to verb 83 down there is 150 degrees, relative to the local horizontal. which means we're - i guess, fairly close to local horizontal, at least within 30 degrees."
"boy, you really have to be careful of these cables, don't you? 04 21 18 40 _ hey, it looks good. looks good."
okay.
huh?
yeah.

"the dark annulus around serenitatis - as you look north - the dark variation there, and i'm kind of looking back - looking a little bit backwards now - but that dark has no continuity with the ridge at all. goes right down the middle of the ridges. as you look directly east of littrow - east - i mean directly west of littrow, the wrinkle ridge is there, and then there's - it comes out, and you have the light tan, tannish, tannish -. there's a dark, i guess you call it - a dark tannish-gray. and then you get out to the light tan of the mare serenitatis, itself."
"okay, dick. you say you're working on the out-of- plane. you're very garbled."
"i wouldn't have thought it, either."
i need the hammer.
...
okay. the hatch is open now. okay.
okay.
"roger, ed."
alined.
"okay; on time - burn time was about 18 or 19 seconds. the residuals were minus .1, plus .2, plus .2, delta-v c was plus .8, and the g&n has a 59.4 by 10.3."
"yes, sir. don't tell anybody, though, because they'll get mad at me."
okay.
roger. aos at carnarvon 2 plus 25 plus 50-
mag metro.
"and the temperatures look good. when you make a burn, does that do something ...?"
this kit isn't medication; that's just - -
ail right. let's - let's ease off at a nice - -
- - to ... the planning stages.
what is your report on descent stage venting - was it venting? anytl_ing else going on? any more venting?
"okay, we'll take them as is."
"houston, this is 15 with some onboard read-outs for you and prds."
"joe, we're filling mv piss with water now. you might check on the water quantity."
"3000 miles to go, gang; 33,971 feet a second, charlie."
"need somebody to hold your foot there, ken?"
"okay. and before you leave the rover, we'd like ycu to pull the bat 2 bus d circuit breaker. we'll let you put it back in before you drive off."
i don't understand why i can't ... there.
okay. on the way. thank you.
"hey, bob, while i'm thinking of it, we're - we're working with one pair of scissors down here. we're going to take them out with us in the etb. you might make a point of reminding us to bring them back."
"okay, now, joe. you're right. i don't know - i don't know where we got - got our wires crossed, but the covers were closed and they're now open."
"okay. here, unplug this."
"3.56 at what, charlie?"
look at the - look at the sculptured hills. okay. i'm sure glad i went up to take that second pan to see that stuff go radially down into the center of the crater at that contact.
huh?
"hey, do you guys ... get some orange juice? ... let's enjoy it - let's enjoy it while we can."
"that's affirmative, ken. they got 03:15 on their data down here."
"tranquility, houston. do you still hear it now? over."

"ok_y, we copy that; 2 minutes. and on the tube 1, did you notice any separation of the two sizes?"
"yes, that's what i was thinking. that's good. you see that rock over at your - just a little south of you?"
he is right in the middle of the coas and he is not moving one iota.
"a minute, and you're tracking pitch 41."
"is that enough out of the way, charlie? okay."
open.
5/5.
"that's affirmative, and did you copy omni alfa?"
less than 0.8? let's wait for it here.
"okay, what we're looking for is to see if anything is in the way of the - the lens of that sensor."
very well. that agrees with our event timer.
"houston, challenger. how would you feel about this canister being changed now?"
"no, let me get over there."
"okay, at - stand by a minute, ken."
now - it's sure not. i mean the material is not white. it's just the same as it -
"- - slight bit of trouble there, and we've got you again. i_l°-eva are you ready for me to go to the alsep?"
"yes, i - i just - okay, i see. yes, it's below 2.5."
"okay, well, that's rounding off to the nearest - -"
that ... is ...
no.
got rid of them.
... let's ... those breakers.
(whisper) 37 - minus 120 - 20.
"hey, joe_ you never did tell me that drill was that important. just tell me that it's that important, and then i'll feel a lot better."
"okay, disconnect ops 02 hose. turn around and i'll get yours."
"hey - hey, bob, this is jack. if you could pos- sibly swing it, i would strongly recommend that we let ron redo that last terminator sequence if we can work it in the flight plan, because gene and i may or may not have done what you wanted there, and i know we missed the first couple of them."
"and, america; houston. we'd like wide on the high gain."
"endeavour, this is houston. how do you read? and, we seem to have a small comm problem. please stand by."
roger.
... my tone and- vent flag.
the point is my hands w_ll be much better off without them.
"loud and clear, now. (_oahead."
... crack it. yeah.
"they're more like wrinkles, they're - linear wrinkles."
i need another decontamination bag. cmp got one for the - that's got a metal plate i_li_ somewhere.
a little tennis.
"yes, sir. t,lw any time."
"yes, mine was ... 00 02 ll 28 _ we're supposed to - how far are we from tli?"
there we go. got them.
got the switch right there. 10 04 29 ]1 cdr sixty-seven. 10 04 29 32 cml° read it (cough).
that's right.
"geno, i'd like to give you just one bit of inform- ation we just got from the simulator. _en you go from this new attitude i gave you - this verb 49 attitude right now - to the eva attitude, you will see a middle gimbal angle of 66 degrees. that's right off the simulator."
you have. i've got ... use high gain ... - - 00 03 27 ll c_ high gain. 00 03 27 12 i_ - - ...
"roger. at 226:15, we're changing that verb 49 maneuver attitude to the following coordinates: 327, 143, 055."
what time does that come on?
"okay, ken. what we'd like for you to do is take the mass spec all the way out and then retract it for 93 seconds."
well - that means we have to change here.
"okay. correction, gene. that was on the left eye, that last one. 02 18 20 ll cml° the last one for ron was at l0 o'clock. three- fourths of the diameter out. just a - ... was only about an eighth of an inch in diameter. right eye."
okay. you want a countdown on this?
that ought to take the surge tank down a little bit. ·.. about at what? about 400?
"and, america, we'll give you a state vector if you give us accept."
uh huh; that's a good point.
okay. lcg pump open?
"oh, yes. sure beats work."
"oh, will do. i plan to drop by and bum a cup of coffee tomorrow."
okay. and i got some gyro torquing angles for you.
"okay. that's in work now, hank."
"apollo 11, this is houston. over"
"manualattitude, three, rate command."
"descartes, fra mauro."

okay. you want _o verify your transponder is off as well as b-37
"aft omni, charlie."
"and the camera is down to about 50 percent here, so i'm going to go ahead and turn it off now."
"yes. it is somewhat, v_mnce. if we have the suni sh:ln_ng ofl'th_ quads, it sort of ruins our vis- ion; and al.:o, if the earth or the moon are _n the genera] field of view, we can't see anything."
"question number 12 for dave and jim. you - you didn't have time to get to north complex, craters which m_y have been formed volcanically and where you thought some surprises might be found. was this a significant loss?"
"buzz, this is houston. you've got about 10 minutes left now prior to commencing your eva termination activities. over. 04 15 11 31 l_' roger. i understand."
"aquarius, houston. request a short count. over."
son of a bitch!
"yes, got them."
"we have noun 47 through roll, pitch, and yaw."
and roger. it's in work.
that's affirm. we understand.
okay.
it's coming up real easy.
did you see him?
"okay. we're about 2 minutes from los. i don't guess we're going to be able to get this pad to you, and we're not going to see you for another rev, about 3 hours."
"you just - yes, ken. i think from a diszance we saw the blue-gray in cochise, you coui_'v make a definite correlation. but it's a good idea and ought to be considered as one of the possibilities. the other is that we juss had a window in the subfloor that coincidentally - i mean one underneath the subfloor might be that breccia. oh, incidentally - the van serg impact hit that window."
"go ahead, houston."
"all right; so then we'd be taking it back out in the seeond eva, if you guys are agreeable to that."
"what did we deserve to do - do to deserve being out here, huh?"
"houston, it's coming in. rooster tail ... - yes, dark striations, vertical - ***tion up and down the a - area rim. and it looks like there's a black - but they all look green. you know, it looks kind of a green-gray in this type of light, back on this side. and a green-gray material down in the center of the rooster tail, on the floor of the rooster tail. and the floor is about one-fourth of the diameter. turn this thing off - 60 - minus peirce, scale 250, 8-second inter- valometer, and i lost my intervalometer. count 8 seconds, i guess. stuck it around here and it disappeared. nothing."
"okay. i'll read a few selected excerpts here. the surface around the landing site is generally an undulating plain, which was somewhat rougher and had a greater abundance of blocks than was expected by the astronauts. it is saturated with small craters not exceeding a few centimeters in size but not with larger craters. sma]l craters commonly have glass on their floors. boulders ranging from about 1/2 meter to 4 meters are common. all of them are partially buried or covered with the dust of the dark mantle. in one locality, a crater of about i meter deep pentrated _ the relatively fine dark surface material and excavated sv,all blocks. other shallower craters in this area did not fully penetrate the mantle. this fact, together with the abundance of small boulders on and near the surface, indicates that the dark ms_tle is relatively thin. a minor amount of dust noted upon landing suggested a thin layer of fine grain unconsolidated material. footprints and lrv tracks left firm impressions in the fine grain material when darker material was kicked up from underneath. at the alsep site, the drill encountered harder material several times and definitely seem to reach harder material at about a 7-foot depth. the deep drill core apparently also bottomed in harder material. in the core, the material was noted to be cohesive, and it contained more fragments than did the surficial material. predominant rock type between the lm and steno crater is medium grained, vesicular or nonvesicular basalts or gabbro. they contain about equal amounts of plagioclase and pyroxene along with less abundant opaque material. the guys took a total of - well, they took a lot of pictures. they had 229 color and 197 black- and-white during eva-1. and they got 17 samples in addition to the deep drill core. three were large, unbagged rocks, and the total, excluding the core, estimated to weigh about 13 kilograms so far, and they traveled about b kilometers in the rover. as a suw_ary conclusion, the observa- tions made on the first eva support the premission interpretation that at least the upper part of the subfloor ms_erials consist of basaltic lava flow. the overlying dark mantle maybe part of the regolith on subfloor material, but the possibility that it is an independent unit re_ns open and will be tested by observations on second and third evas. both the dark mantle and upper subffloor units contain remarkably little foreign material between the alsep site and steno with suggests comparatively young ages. over."
you ought to have me now. does it do you any good?
"yes, it's still closed."
"roger; p20, option 5; plus-x forward, sim attitude. the time is 211 plus 40. ¥_tb 23 noun 78, plus 180.00. the attitude is 141, 000/177, 000."
"okay, joe. on the drill top end goes alfa."
"s_m again, charlie."
okay.
we could sure make some improvements in stuff.
coming down.
"well, we can't use that term _iymore. that's copyrighted."
okay.
(laughter)
"apollo 15, houston. how do you read?"
"fifteen, 12 each or - -"
okay.
plss 02 is off.
"the area out the left-hand window is a re±a- (tranq) tively level plain cratered with a fairly large number of craters of the 5- to 50-foot variety, and some ridges - small, 20, 30 feet high, i would guess, and literally thousands of little 1- and 2-foot craters around the area. we see some angular blocks out several hundred feet in front of us that are probably 2 feet _n si?e and have angular _:dges. there is a hill jn view, just about on the ground track ahead of us yiffic_lt to estimate, but might be a half a mile or a mile. b4 [_704 54 cc roger, tranquility. we copy over."
...
"thank you. okay. it is off, as a matter of fact. shall i turn it on now?"
"houston, america. looks like we're with you again."
i don't know (laughter).
what's the master ... for?
"so did i. i got it, too."
right there.
okay.
"well, i don't want to trade with you."
mark; standby.
"okay. if you have your tracking light on, you can turn it off before you burn it out. maybe they can figure out some way to make it useful yet."
"0ka_. houston, how do you read falcon?"
and i think that ought to he up in - should show up in the pan camera.
we're what? 26 - 27-1/2 now.
and the gamma ray shiet.d is back on.
i suspect we've got something like the moon in front of those stars.
"okay, we're going to block."
"go. - go ahead, 15."
"yes. 07 03 h9 o1 cdr oh, eyeballing."
"we're about a minute and a half to t-start, now. c_p okay. cue release, [?] enter."
"well, what _re we going to do about these gloves; we take them both ... suits, right?"
"that's correct. and that - assuming that your cue card was clean to start with, that should give you a - a good cue card, not only for the plane change but also for any rescue maneuvers and also for the shaping burn. p 06 19 23 08 c_p roger; understand."
okay; i've got it.
"how about some flight - when you come around again, can you start the flight plan updates?"
"okay, jim. and we've already got a change to what we just told you. under ecs, close the cabin repress, and insure that the asa breaf_r is closed under s and c."
...
"and the information first half of the experiment. the orientation was 90 degrees from this one. (laughter) in that the lineal cell was on the right, and the lineal cell was aligned with the xx axis."
"okay, that's affirm. you'll be doing the ptc in yaw, and we'll give you a call at each time you change yaw - yaw attitude. aside from that, request low bit rate off; then down voice backup off; then power ampl off; and then fda off."
okay. we've got ... here.
"yes, you do. they're down in this pocket, right there."
i can if you can give me an update.
like this one over here at i o'clock.
"oks_v. 05 (3059 ],1 cdr houston, aquarius."
"clipper, houston. are you in auto now?"
"okay, we copy that. you think you're getting breccias there, then?"

yes.
"no, it's not important. wondered what - we hadn't had an update in a while. y'all must have ran out of pa - - time skip"
okay; lmp was - lmp was - 83 to 70.
"... do like that, does it?"
"generally what is it, bob?"
"all righty. i got my feet well locked, and i got a good suit pressure, and cooling is just fine, and let me tell you a few things about the old sim bay. okay. the first thing that's real obvious to you out here is the - is the amount of bubbling on the service module paint. it's more - it's a bit more than i anticipated seeing and the radiator panel down to the right side of the sim bay looks nice and clean. there's no bubbles on the paint cr anything like that. the area right under the quad - i'll have to raise my visor to see - yeah, i got the inner one still down. i will. yeah, you don't need to remind me of that one."
no. that's all right.
"okay, houston. i'm at the door, ready for ingress. getting ready to open the hatclh, now."
"okay. this should be getting larger, smd if it is, it's the place we're coming 1ome to."
"okay, on your right side. okay: i got it, and it's moving in - it looks like a combination now. it's moving though. it's oscillating at this time. now it's steady."
no. go ahead and - what you got to do.
"shifting to 1/250. 1/250 i shifted to at spencer jones. i'm shifting a little later because it's a rev later. spencer jones is again another one of these strange ones that looks like it's slumped. it looks like it's been here forever with slumps in it. they're all around it. they don't have sharp terraces anywhere. i have the impression that with- in the material that comes from spencer jones down - down into pap - papaleski is even smoother, and it looks like it flows down in there and just creeps over it. and this is true all over the north - excuse me, the northeast and also the southwest side."
sure is strange not to see some fine-grained rocks out here. seen a couple but certainly not very many. that rock that you picked up at - *** doing up there? okay.
"okay, fredo, the bottom - bit on this string was at - what - 23? isn't it, al? that's the one you got."
okay. we'll start with a rock.
"okay, my suit power's going off - -"
i don't understand the note here. that was the note i got. maybe it was used up before - before they loaded it or something. i'll find out.
is it in the flight plan?
"say again, 0.4."
"roger, goddard. i'm reading you loud and clear, honeysuckle. i'm not getting to him."
"this is probably flank right here, isn't it?"
roger. and now we want to power down as soon as possible.
"- - scoop, and i'll get the hammer. then make sure your bag is closed."
copy that.
"okay. why don't you just go to p, primary, and let me check a look at her."
it won't turn.
roger.
okay.
"okay, houston, you copying the 93_"
"okay, bob, i've trenched across the trend of the yellow - or the orange. there is light gray material on either side."
okay.
"yes. wow - 03 14 0t 07 lmp hey, let's get out - let's g_ab our lm landmark chart for this low pass."
okay; 96.03. 03 21 06 55 i24p now we're getting some clear - look like pretty clear high-water marks on the - -
roger. ab_0 on the cabin gas return.
okay. and the skipper in the sack now? oh 13 21 56 cmp say again?
it'd have to be.
okay. look it. let's get the cameras squared away; let's get all set to burn. we got one chance now.
"barber pole, back to gray. okay, ready for a little crew status."
that's one of those - -
...? we got another 30 degz?es to go.
"boy, it'll be no trouble sampling the south ray at station 8; it looks like that this ray goes right across it."
"okay, bob. the antenna is deployed. it's not on the post yet, but it's deployed. i_mp-eva oh, oh, come on. don't get - don't get all caught on something. that's better, that's better. okay, bob. i think - just about got a - the sunside deployed, just as perpendicular to the sun as i think anybody could do."
okay.
"look's like you've got a superconservative cmp up there. we've run off some numbers - looks like you used about 40 pounds of rcs on the t&d, and you've used about a total of 42 pounds rcs total; so we're hanging right in there. beautiful."
"okay, we verify high bit rate. 04 l0 59 30 kmp okay, quad flags. okay. verb 76 enter."
"apollo 15, this is houston."
signal's straight greater than 3 - -
"there you go; thats - see that's the t. at at cdh, 1.53. okay. lg"
"hey, houston, will you look at your solar panel?"
"okay. boy, this'll give them a view. oh my."
"aquarius, houston."
"and now, we get to put your purge, in 208."
"14, houston. go ahead."
"say, fred, did you get the dope on the saturn _v impact - s-ivb impact?"
oksy.
mark. mode i bravo.
"bob, to me the sculptured hills incorporate the albedo, both of the north massif, or the massif and the mantle area and combine them to give you a generally in-between gray albedo, but the sculp- turing is produced by the darker albedo that looks like the mantle, and the lighter albedo that looks like the massif."
"you ought to really smoke this baby over from one end to the other, when we get - the food's no problem, but anything else is, you know, get rid of it. like you say, if we could get rid of those turds, we'd have it made."
that's right?
"charlie, since i don't have to carry the gnomon any more, i could carry a sample bag in one hand. we could use that technique."
you can leave them off.
...
"translation control power, off."
"no, i just wanted to make sure it was running."
"okay; understand. ""pan camera power to on for 5 minutes and then to off."""
the trouble is the landing radar test won't tell us anything about that transistor.
"dave, we think that the increase in the cabin pressure during the suit integrity check could have raised it frc_ - from your side."
yep.
"everything's fine up there. i just looked over occasionally. you've been keeping me so occupied here, but they've got no problems."
yes.
"ken, it looks like the next action in the flight plan for you is around 125:13 where it says ""gdc align."" i think we've scratched out everything ahead of that."
.-- except your aea dec - and deca power.
"yes, i wouldn't know the switches on it."
"okay. and then they said something about ... data of 17 instead of 16, right?"
"da-da-da-dum, da-deedle-de-de. there's old cassiopeia."
"okay, 13; houston. the booster says that the propulsive dump is concluded; he now has the nonpropulsive vents open and what you see is a normal phenomenon and it should go on for another 5 minutes or so."
mine hasn't yet.
roger. will you be starting into your lunch break now?
what have you got?
"that's what we're doing, going west. i'm not sure we didn't - i'm not sure that's not it right there, charlie."
"okay, now° do you think i ought to be farther away, or closer? 04 13 59 o1 lm_ can't get too much further away."
"oh - yes. 07 03 31 20 _ and s don't think that's going to be a big deal, i think - -"
"yes. yes, that's it. 06 23 4_ 47 cm3 and the part that the waxed surface - so _o speak - in analogy there, is a light bluish-gray. cma° picture number 1 on the nikon was looking south along the terminator in the rilles east - west of aristoteles. c_w_5 and the picture number 2 is looking towara timocharis."
okay. copy that. november november at 130.
looking good.
"roger, jim. copy. and the motor temps are normal."
"okay, copy that - -"
okay. that was all i wanted. ail righty. 01 06 36 39 _ fuel side went up to about 175.
"0, 1, 10 - - -- 04 13 30 41 lmp 32"
okay.
how much?
don't know how much time do we have here?
"go ahead. 04 20 29 02 cdr-i_m before you get too far into that broad, flat plain out there, i hope we made it clear that there is a fairly good population of craters, which we're going to probably have to drive around. even though there are no boulders, we're still going to have somewhat of a wander factor in avoiding the 3- to 4-meter cra_ers."
i wish we - the one thing i didn't do. while you're doing that -
okay .... go to the ...
we'll give you a weight here shortly.
can't see much.
"good readback, ken. and in regard to that question you had about 16-3, your present grol_udtrack _s about 15_000 feet sou_h of the preplsmned_ sa_dthat puts 16-1 outside the acceptable limits; 16-3 is closer to the landing site, smd they would like for you to go ahead and use that."
"roger. at 180 hours 50 minutes get, we should like to delete your oxygen fuel cell purge."
"okay. 06 04 26 38 _mp-eva okay, here goes it for trench bottom. 06 0_ 26 39 cc roger."
"roger, houston."
yes_ but they're range and range rates.
"roger, jack."
"okay, jack. one question here. if we transfer power 15kc this, we're not going to cut us short on power remaining in the csm ..., are we ...?"
can you hear me?
"we've got a little - seeing some funnies on the v/h override, so after pan camera, standby, stereo, and power, we want to add the following: v/h override, high altitude - high alt."
yes_ i think my valve is probably a little clogged.
"we want to transfer some power - i want to go to high bit rate here first, then want to transfer lm power to csm, fred."
extraordinary.
"13, houston. go ahead."
okay.
"that was the last question, john. we thank you very much, and thank you for the kind comments."
"okay, it's open. lmp-i_i okay. lmp's water is open. you got yours. cdr~lm yes, i got mine. excuse me. well, let's see. lmp-i_ okay, you got it open, so i need to turn around. see if i can back in and out of the way of the door."
"guess we're - what, 50 feet?"
okay. going to page 34.
i don't know. he's going to fire straight down.
okay. you want to leave it there?
copy that.
"oh, these windows are just really frosting."
okay.
"roger. columbia, i have los and aos times for you this pass with msfn. los 109 plus 21 plus 12. a0s coming around on the corner 110 07 35. over."
"it'll have been on for 32, 34 hours before he was - -"
"leave it alone. it seems to have gone away, jack. it may have been a ground problem."
"roger. on the photo, you'll probably have to reestablish the attitude for ptc and then when- ever it comes into the window again, why we'll just be standing by for the photo."
"charlie, hand me the jett bag."
yes. i can see it. just barely see it out of nv window.
roger.
"okay, and back on down."
"endeavour, this is houston. it's time to turn off the mapping camera."
"yeah, that's at 800 feet - - ll 01 48 23 cml° - - ... - - ·. coni t b ttlal"
"looking out window - window 3 now, and the moon is just the size of the window, and i've got my face right up against the window."
i know that.
"bmag mode, three, rate 2."
got a big glass splotch on it.
76:28.
roger.
i've got - i've got the color.
just a second.
contact light.
"apollo 11, houston. we'd like you to do two more on star 45. over."
"you did, huh?"
"okay, fred. on row 3 under comm, open displays and under ecs, open displays."
"okay. and, jack, while you're unloading there - -"
i'm going to get that from here.
"okay, here's number 9. one, two, and she's fully released; the hook clears the docking ring. okay, number 10. here's one, two - fully released, and the hook clears the docking ring. there's one ... okay, handle's free; j-hook clears the ring. i've only got one more to go. there's the first latch there's two latches ... came over. and the hook stays clear; the handle is free. and, by golly, they're all off. hey, challenger; america. you're hanging on those three little bitty things. okay. i put the old - hatch in."
"have at it. we'll take any words you've got. we expended all our questions a few minutes ago with john, and in fact i didn't even have to ask any; he just answered them all, so - but press on."
"i don't believe so, joe, right now. we'll have to look at those time lines, and think about it for a little bit."
",.,"
"okay, that's the one we had trouble with before. that's what we expected. okay, you can go number 2 to retract now."
oh (laughter).
okay. *** at it now.
"go ahead. go ahead, ron."
roger. and just proceed with caution.
"that's going in bag 380, houston."
"_d, 16, houston. whenever you get a chance, we'd like to get yesterday's crew status and today's crew status report."
"why don't you let me get it, al? stand up. stand up, al."
...
okay.
okay. that's okay. 06 o1 55 49 i_p-eva want to shut it down for a while? y-
okay.
"how do you feel, charlie?"
have any ...?
"it's going to retract now. 08 01 _8 43 c_ houston, can we start the new maneuver to the jett attitude? over. 08 oi 48 49 cc stand by 16. 08 01 h9 25 cc 16, houston. give us the sih bay roll-jet con- figuration and start your verb 49. i think that's what you've got in there now."
roger.
all right.
okay. i've got you; i got you.
darn right.
internal. external.
"minus 38. houston, apollo 14. how do you read?"
roger. hope _hey come out nice.
"there's this one to jettison to the lm, ken, i put up here in u-1 - to replace the lcgs."
"huh? there you go - how'd you know, ...?"
"you know, we could regulate this valve down here."
"yes, i was just testing out the survival techniques in space."
"it's pure feldspar, looks like - -"
that's fine.
"if there are no pgns, we abort after high gate - unless after high gate."
tte's on the porch waiting - - 06 05 5g 58 cdr-eva sitting on the porch waiting for charlie to move out of the way.
"okay; kind of figured that, al."
okay. this number 2 one?
we got enough room to deploy three alseps out there.
"hello, apollo 11. houston. did you copy? over."
okay.
(laughter) ail night long with no biomed.
... firing thrusters.
"well, we've got it anyway. see what it looks like here. 06 00 07 36 i/_p-eva ah ha."
that's affirmative.
we don't need those guys.
"okay. on the next page, at 190:15, p52 - -"
"- - so it's kind of puzzling, you know. it started out real slow and each retraction it got faster."
"oh, there's - - o0 o0 b8 18 cdr that was a good start."
"one more on the cue card for tli down slightly below the middle, the long cue card that the cdr uses at 54 minutes. the 24 degrees should be changed to 25 degrees. ordeal 300/lunar, 25 degrees. f"
"okay. don't need to close the co_ tv breaker, i guess."
"you got an 0 flag and a vent flag, press flag and a - -"
roger. and this pan camera is the one at 151:03 in the fligl_t plan.
"okay, three ones - 02 and a zero, four ones."
"17, it's your computer. you have a state vector, verb 66, and a target load, and a pipa bias update."
"okay, charlie. here i come. keep cool, man."
"i'll tell you, that rover is a pretty picture out there."
"jim, could we - -"
okay. i got mine.
"not only keep me honest. there. okay. where am i? okay. gnomon's an island. actually, up here, it's a geometric reference for photogramat - grat - photogr_mmetry."
"okay, tony. i just picked up one that is in bag 15 that is - has a black matrix - bluish-black matrix with a lathlike - either clasts or phenocrysts in it. and it's right behind the lm here. i don't know whether that's what we're looking for or not."
"that's correct, jim. and this is to guard against a single-point failure that - a remote possibility that would preclude you from getting the batteries back on. jap: 67/4 04 02 _'{ 04 cd!! roger,"
185 and 1.5. 185 and 1-1/2. okay.
"apollo 11, this is houston. do you rc:_d? over. 00 04 02 31 lmt all of a sudden there, we heard a litt'e click, and the signal strength began to start dropping off. your transmissions were cut off ¢ery abruptly. how do you read now?"
"okay, bob - -"
"it's surprising, hank, how great things are just looking through the telescope and i can't spend much time over here with the naked eye ..."
"well, once we get squared away, joe, i think i am going to have to go to the space center and take a good healthy one and leave just about everything. i've held up long enough. 04 09 42 32 iaip that's coming from above. another one just - is just coming down right over here. well, there's the old terminator at fra mauro. we'd been landing about 2 hours ago, huh? right on the - -"
"we have, houston. yes. yes. now, look, al. look over here. we're way out from the lm. over here, al."
go.
roger. cut in.
"that's affirmative. and in the little msfn updave block there, cancel - delete the photo pad - pc photo pad, the ltv photo pad, and the maneuver pad. and change the ""tei-53"" to tei-54."""
you there?
"oh, man. you son of a gunl"
"- - about - maybe 50 meters - okay, and on the south - i can just barely see the - west slope - western slope of earthlight. but the southern slope of it, i can also see, has several blocks on it."
roger. we saw that before he went on.
stand by. i can tell you're still looking for our position.
"question number 2. near spur crater, you found what may be genesis rock, the oldest yet collected on the moon. tell us more about it."
"okay, bob, before we exit ptc av 20 past vhe next hour, we'll have to get your final words on the midcourse."
right-o.
"okay. we're just traveling right around the - we're traveling about 100 meters inside the rim, and we're at 195, 1.h now."
"oh, yes."
"oh, nol okay, i goofed it. i'll take it again. hey, get over here, pete. get one more shot."
get it?
blocky rimmed?
"0kay. copy that, challenger."
"yes. it looks like you're getting a good - 2 to 3 inches down, as you rake through there. 06 21 57 18 iamp-eva must be hung up on a large one here."
i wanted that one because it had that inclusion wrapped in it. *** high here for a minute. *** one are you talking about? this one here?
_oger. that's a nice shot there of marginls.
"roger, ed."
okay.
"okay, you want to dump the waste water on the front side?"
"okay. _..,.a........._._..p.lus 6. thank you. 04 ]2 09 04 (ic okay. the moon. thank you."
"okay. 087, 12.7, 6.0; 105 and 100. on the bat- tery temps 100, 120. the rear motors are off scale low and the forward motors are 0 and 240."
you're still on the front page with the lineal cell.
"roger, jack. any more master alarms? imp we had one when ron's - looked like his neck ring hit panel 2...."
"and, endeavour; houston. before you get los and get too busy with transfer, i need to give you a camera photo pad for the next pass."
"i'll look at them. 05 23 21 22 _ starting to drift off. 05 23 21 26 c_ man, the old earth went right through the coas. 05 23 21 29 l_ i'll take them."
should come off pretty easy.
yes.
"ron, while you're thinking here a second, do you have any views on the possible origin of the domes in aitken?"
"roger. 04 11 00 32 cdr-seva and - all of the - all of the features around here are very smooth. the tops of the mountains are rounded off. there are no sharp jagged peaks or no large boulders apparent anywhere. the whole surface of - the area appears to be smooth, with the largest fragments i can see are in the walls of pluton. there are no boulders at all on st. george, hill 305, bennett, or, as far as i can tell, looking back up at hadley. hadley's sort of in the shadow. it's a gently rolling terrain completely around ....360 degrees -- hl_mmocky, much like you saw on 14. the pitch line ac - across the rille, from hill 305 around to i o'clock, seems to be - slightly lighter in albedo, with some white marks from craters, recent craters, apparently. bennett hill also has - a lighter-colored albedo. one face of it, that facing the sun, now is almost completely white. as i come around to my 2 o'clock, the horizon is really the northern complex. i can see, as i mentioned before, chain, icarus, and pluton are very rounded, subdued craters. it looks like the southern rim of pluton is on the same level as our location here. the northern rim is somewhat higher. i'd say dist - distances are difficult --but maybe 50 meters higher. i can _ see the scarp on the other side of the north rim of pluton. all of it very flat, smooth, and gently rolling. inside walls of pluton are - fairly well covered with debris, fragments up to, i'd estimate, maybe, oh, 2 to 3 meters, irregular, no layering, just sort of scattered around, and maybe the walls have 5 percent fragments. as i look on around - to the north, mount hadley itself is in the shadow, although i can see that the ridge line on the top of mount hadley - it too is smooth. i see no jagged peaks of any sort. the hill i would call number 22 on your map - far distance - also looks smooth and rounded; no prominent features. i'll skip the distant field around to my 6 o'clock, because it's all in the shadow. and looking into the sun, of course, obliterates almost everything. as i look on down to my - 7 o'clock, i guess i see index crater here, the near field. but, back up on hadley to the east of hadley delta, why, again i can see a smooth surface. however, i can see lineaments. i'll take a picture for you. there's some very interesting - take - silver pass [sic] and look at 13 on your map. i can't tell whether it's 13 or 16, right now, because of the sun. but there appear to be lineaments or lineations running - dipping through the northeast, parallel. and they appear to be, maybe, 3 percent to 4 percent of the total elevation of the mountain, almost uniform. i can't tell whether it's structure or internal stratigraphy or what. but there are definite linear features there, dipping to the - to the northeast, at about - oh, i'd say 30 degrees. and, as i look up to hadley delta itself, i can see what appears to be a sweep of linear features that curve around from the western side of hadley delta on down to the spur down there. and they seem to be dipping to the - to the east at about 20 degrees. these are much thinner - lineations on the mountain than i saw before. these probably are less than i percent of the total elevation of the mountain. the craters on the side of hadley delta are rather few. around window and spur, those that you see on your maps f_ are the only ones i can see, and there appear to be, oh, about a dozen of them in that particular area. i might associate those with a secondary cluster, if i took a guess at it. i see nothing that indicates any flow down - or a landslide down hadley delta, only some subtle changes in topography. there's one bright fresh crater right next to st. george on the eastern side with almost white albedo, and it's got an ejecta blanket about a crater diameter away. how are you copying so far?"
"well, it's checked okay."
huh?
boost/entry.
"yes. let's do that after we get to the next station, though."
"15, this is houston. we still have a concern _ about your ops pressure and would appreciate it, if it's at all accessible, to have a reading at the present time."
affirm.
which side was the glass on when you looked at it?
"yep, that's good thinking. okay; while we're changing that out, if you want to - you want to do your thing with the computer, or do you want us to do the p52 first?"
put this over on a1 bean's side; he's got all the freaking pills out of the csm medical kit.
"good. how are you this morning? 06 13 54 52 cdr-i_m houston, challenger."
"good. oh, the old commander's camera. right down in the old dust. that's on - that's on the floorboard; that's not onto the ground."
looks like picture-taking time again.
"roger. gamma ray shield, off. stand by, charlie. _aey say it's already off - -"
okay. looks good on board.

look at that rock right in front of us. it looks like a contact between a blue and a gray.
"while we're in a relatively quiet period, we're going to make a few comments about some of the things that cross the two big basins that we're getting very familiar with - or, actually, three: smythii, ori - smythii, crisium, and serenitatis - and the degradation of the balls of the major ring and the lack of any obvious blanket structures, i think, in contrast to imbrium and orientale, which we've also had a pretty good look at - orientale and earthshine, on the earlier revs - is quite striking - that contrast is quite striking - to me, at any rate. also_ within orientale s the - at least at the southeast - on the east-south- east portions of the mare floor, the wrinkle- ridge system is not nearly as well developed; but there is a wrinkle-ridge system that roughly forms an inner floor ring, at any rate."
"15, go ahead."
"we're gonna have to hook that back up, because we're going to do a checkout again tomorrow and hook it into here."
"okay, houston. i'm looking at oxidizer pressure just about 210. we're going to leave the valves in auto."
okay; we'd like some more blocky ones.

okay.
that's right.
we should have kept all those camera bags.
"okay, we need high bit rate."
"they're not smeared, but i just didn't overlap some of them."
"okay. well, one - one i deploy at the end, i know. i thought we had an extra one here somewhere."
"i guess the main thing we have to talk about is the inspection of the v over h sensor of the pan camera. are you ready to listen, al?"

"well, there might be a rise, you know, there at the - at the rille."
"okay, very good."
"okay, forward ]dumpvalve's auto. we ought to reconfigure vkf so - stu won't have to listen to everything - even music."
"i'm glad we have the right solution to that one, gene."
"okay, you going to torque to 283 dave."
"there's only a 2 by 2 flap in the upper left-hand corner. yeah, but it's more than 2 by 2; it's about - there's a hole that's covered up - there's a hole up there, and it's covered up in the upper left-hand corner, or almost covered up."
it's in your seat pan.
okay. stand by.
"yes, sir, or maybe even a double core. we think you can probably drive two of them. - 06 21 57 56 cdr-eva okay. i think we probably can, too. i was just giving you a little bait there."
yes.

"okay. eecoms happy about that now, finally. and, gene - the cd - your data looks good."
"down along the margin in the bottom of mendeleev, there's - some of the dark materials that are out there. they've all got this little textured slope to them. really, i think that's about all you can say for it is that it's just textured. it's very strange."
okay.
"okay, the lm power circuit breaker is in. what the - let me know what you want, okay? okay, going to off, reset. okay, back on. and, i have to open my ... again. the pressure's been? i don't know what it is."

"okay, jack; thank you."
"gordy, could you give me a summary of what your expectations are on _he o_aration of the pugs?"
"well, we're - gene's sort of headed for station 6 now. cer-eva i'm going to take a tour around that boulder and get a case on it."
"okay, and let me get a picture of what you're doing."
that's affirmative. about an hour from now.
understand.
"too far away, huh? l0 04 19 41 _ it's way out of the - -"
"okay. i've got this verb 49 maneuver that's at 201:30. we want to change that from a maneuver to thermal attitude to a ramu - maneuyer to sco x-1 attitude. and the angle - the new angles are at 347, 071, 000, and the high gain is minus 36, and yaw is 176. and we also want to add alpf_& particle/x-ray cover, open, at that point."

"yes, i'll take one with some water, in a minute."
okay.
"roger, that sounds interesting."
"we didn't have our vhf on. i think it was just vhf. i - i think that's what it was, when they were - -"
yes. can you get some of the swirls - -
"okay, bob. i'd - i would estimate that i was in the extend position a total of about 15 seconds."

i'll try ... maneuver ...

"okay. go ahead with the tli pad, joe."
"roger. we haven't got the picture up here yet. stand by, and i'll give you a check on that."
roger. and i - i - think you know that we'd probably - that we - we don't want to go into those operations until we have got into the correct attitude.
ail right. ° 06 o1 08 09 lmp ... that radar in s-band ...
"okay, jack, i've wrested control -"
and my cuff gage went up to 5. - 5.0. good. suit circuit's at 4.6. that's okay. and i'm decaying.
"yes. yes. excuse me i second, will you?"
i thought i saw it coming up.
"houston, apollo 11. over."
"yes. i'll leave it right there. it really is annoying, isn't it?"
mark.
"houston, what site have you got on that ...?"
"houston, could you ...?"
"try again, al, now."
"okay, i've got it in. i_m going to call p52."
"17, houston. just a couple words. we'd like you to know we're real satisfied with all the lm data that we saw during the lm activation work today. and, looking at it, the data looked real good."
i'll go behind that rock; that looks good from here.
"no, i've got it here."
"instrumentation secondary; cwga, open and then close."
and in the walls of some - of a large crater - i'll try to figure out which one it is in a minute. it's near the large crater that the sculptured hills define you can see in the east wall - or maybe northeast wall of that crater - an area of bluish-gray - material that is streaking the normal tan-gray of that crater wall.
"ob, i did from there, hut i didn't see that - i eculdn't tell whether - you can't see this west side - east side of it to see whether the thing is really filled in from a flow or not or whether it's just subsident. that's what i really wanted to find out. tape 'fi/6"
"got it? in the bag, huh? 04 05 17 lb cmp in the bag."
yes. i know it. that's why i reminded you - on it being down here.
"yes, the gulf looks like it's pretty well filled with clouds. looks pretty thick from here."
"okay. 0b 23 16 37 lmp see if we can put that *** ... oh 23 16 38 cdr *** ... in all the way. 04 23 16 39 lmt_ ... it out. 04 23 16 41 cdp yes. 04 23 16 43 lmt' *** you had hooked the plss harness on, hadn't you?"
"okay, do y'all want to be checked with before we do that, or you just want to ge ahead and do it?"
"okay, we're coming up on 59:40 -"
"it's 750, jack."
i can't quite reach it.
"good thinking. oh, okay; yes. let's do it again. except i got dust all over it."
- - go ahead.
yeah.
"beg your pardon? oh 03 46 07 cdr %_nich way should we pitch to get to you? 04 03 46 10 cm_ oh, let me see. you're all - oh, boy. it's hard to tell what figures i'm looking at except rate. i think i'm looking at the top of you though."
"columbia, that's negative. this 130 is the little bitty crater there that you tracked - john young's crater - that you tracked prior to descent. and we want that - -"
anything else before i go over to the lm?
"yes. long time since breakfast, i think, wasn't it?"
i put it 1/250 at f/ll. f/8 was probably a better choice.
i'll bet they sat there and watched you go.
what cdr coremhave you got?
"32 - 0 - 0 - 470. you did it. okay, plus 0116.9. good show."
"okay, i have it. little more."
standby.
"yes, it's, i can't really tell for sure even through the ,_nocular that it is, but it looks the same relative position to the stars. and the best i can tell about the same intensity and still about the same distance from us."
okay.
"doing our best, joe."
"okay, then we'll put that in the big bag."
"i'm not having any trouble at all with weightlessness. 00 06 29 01 _rp i'm not either, al. o0 06 29 06 cer how are you doing, stu?"
......
"okay, orion. i'm gonna turn my rear engines off as soon as it looks like we're stable here and go ahead and proceed with the closeout of the tunnel. 03 23 32 40 i_mp okay."
"hey, ron. we assume the scissors went out the hatch. is that affirm?"
you want the laser altimeter on while we try to retract that?
"ail right, and then on beyond it abo_t 10 feet is an even larger rock that's very rounded. that rock is about - the closest one to yol_ is about sticking our of the sand about 1 foot. and it's about a foot and one-half long, and it's ab_u_ 6 inches _hiek_ but _t_s stanaing on edge. 04 ih o1 16 cc roger. oh 14 o1 26 li__ okay, neil. i've got the tahle out _,_ the bag deployed."

okay. go for the burn?
"that's going to be pointing right at the lunar module, houston."
"okay, jim. and turn off the 16-millimeter camera, please. the film should be run through."
"okay. it's pretty hard to tell. from where we were on stone mountain, it looks like - i could see double spot and we were just about - from where we were at station 4 up at stone mountain, i could see double spot and they were just a little past it, but not much. --separate, si_fltaneous communications link in use betwe.en cc and cm 06 09 06 xx begin lunar rev 41"
"15, houston. if you'll give us high gain and pitch of plus 7, yaw of 250, then we'll be able to keep high gain for the next 2 or 3 hours, and i won't have to keep calling you for omnis. over."
okay. i got the latch - the handle and latch.
"no. as soon as the carrier dropped off, why, it drifted over into those angles anti stayed there. then when it came back up again, why, it hunted around for a while, but it didn't get any further off. gradually brought it on in to the angles where it is right now; and then the signal strength would take several jumps as evidently it goes from wide to medium to narrow. over."
okay. that's up for me; looks like it ought to be down for you.
"okay, let me hit some more. ready?"
roger.
"okay. i think it's finally coming through to us here, what you said just a little while ago. were you suggesting that we move the t. up 30 minutes? lg i"

"okay, move around to the front."
"hand me a set of tongs, too, will you?"
"also, the she tank looks exactly nominal, as far as the rise rate goes, to us."
"okay, bob. that means that you're not going to actually do any clock updates or syncs until - until somewhere in the 60's there and not in the 40's."
okay. we copy that.
"gee, that's nice. gee, that's weird (laughter). 04 21 37 11 i_p (laughter) those arms, on earth they just flop down in position. here, they don't even want to stay. there they go."
it really is.

"in fact, ed calculates that you were 480 feet- 480 feet - from the lens. as they say, too far is better than too close."
pretty interesting.
"water sep select, pull/sep 2."

roger. i understand. this is - the purpose of this was so that they can get a calibration on just how much motion comes with that. they can tell where the zero point and smear comes on the film. is that correct? that's just a gee-whiz thing.

"sure it's there, geno? we can shove it underneath your couch."
"okay. in answer to the battery-charging questions, i calculate it should be fully charged at 12:35. play that one, though, the same as the waste vent. if you want to do it earlier because you're turning in, why that's fine with us."

some of the big ones that are just barely expose_ above the regolith looked quite well-rounded. most of those around the craters are subangular. i think - i got the impression that it's just purely a function of how long the same material's been exposed; but some of the big boulders like the one out near the geophones is quite angular in part and quite rounded on other parts. it's quite variable.

okay. it's 2 hours since you started the original charge. if your question is - can you go right ahead to the topoff - with the topoff - the answer is yes.
"yes, it looks like the old gravity gradient worked there or something. i didn't see it get out of attitude at all. did you all see any movement at all?"
okay .... tape10/2
"falcon, can you read endeavour now?"
go.
i'll say.
okay. we polled the room. we don't have much for you. only comments as follows: your con- sumables are looking good; your entry gamma right now is minus 6.01. we're expecting a midcourse of 2.81 foot per second which should be about 21 seconds of rcs.
yes; okay.
i don't think we can both turn around at the same time.
"hey, john, could you spin around here? ... behind you."
(laughter). charlie. thanks for those words of encouragement.
yes. good.
man the camera.
are you ready?
in the hag. in the bag.
suppose we do. okay. 3-33-033 is the bearing; the range is 0.1.
no.
"dave, we may have dinged them when the suit went on. they looked real fine all night long."
"and, 15, whenever a1 has a couple of minutes, we have a few questions about the se bay that we'd like to debrief on."
"okay, hank. and i can copy your comments about the sim bay now if you'd like to give them now, while - -"
"and, houston, in our present attitude, a yaw cdu change would be converted to a pitch rate, so that sort of all adds up."

"america, houston. if you give us accept, we'll give you a new state vector. nothing much wrong with the one you've got, but we're just going to tweak it up."
"it looks just like - an oxidized desert soil, that's exactly right."
yes. we're always thining that way.
"why don't you go ahead and button this up? cabin repress, close?"
"al, another bulletin from hadley rille. the crew is back at the lm and starting their closeout. just a few minutes ago_i saw them perform the philatelic wonder of the century."

there you go.

that's a jackpot.

"charlie, your feedwater pressure is still building. 06 0_ 53 10 lmm-eva ... over here to the right by that - -"
"roger. oh, i'd like to also add here, ken, and - of course, as you well know, we - in this mysteri- ous glitch solutions, we gotta shotgun it, and we're trying to find the areas that are a prime candidate for glitch in the cdu. and one of these is during your gdc align procedure, when you have your att set switch to att set and you either switch in to or out of imu on the source. what you're doing here is loading up the cdu's, and they feel that this is a prime candidate for a glitch. so, our words of wisdom are to minimize the number of times that you use this switch, and i guess after your gdc align in the normal check- list;,we'd kind of like to see you not cycle that source switch to imu with your att set switch in att set. i guess you could still check your gdc versus noun 20s if you wanted to, but i did want you to be aware of this particular switch combi- nation as - as loading up the cdu. and this is where we have the probability of glitches."
"yes. there are two spots over there that might be outcrop, tony. there's a -"
okay.
"okay, let me pull my visor down. i can't believe it. tony, do we look as dirty to y'ali as we do to each other?"

okay.
how about scs/tvc servo power number 2?
"roger, jim. just out of curiosity, has the sim bay door long since disappeared from view?"
"no, i guess not."
"okay, we've got the bag off. we're getting ready to start another one, and most of the particles have stopped."
go ahead.
what? cdr_eva *** i'm out of film.
(laught er) you're right.
"no, i've been checking it, bob, my biggest prob- lem is that the flags don't anchor."
"and i think we have it fairly well documented. it's in collection bag number 3, which will help you keep track of it."
"dave, this is houston. we agree that, if you've hit bottom there and think there's no way you'll go any deeper, just press on and put the probes in this hole. r 05 05 00 42 cdr-eva okay, joe. i'll give it mon- one more try here and see if i can get some more, but - i tell you one thing, the base at hadley is firm."
you'd just go - -
"how's our time, bob?"
i'm going to get the drill out.
"the next question is for all the crew. the american people seem to be getting fairly blase about space flight and television coverage of apollo 17 has been at a minimum. but this is not the case abroad. for example, in the republic of zaire, the former belgian congo_ an estimated 20 million people are watching extensive coverage on tv sets set up in the villages. what do you have to say to the people of underdeveloped nations? well, gordy, first of all, i'm not sure that the amount of television coverage is necessarily a measure of the interest of the american people. i don't have those figures at hand. i'm sorry to hear that the adventures we had and the insight that maybe we gained into not only ourselves, but to the history of the solar system was not shared extensively with the _erican people, if that's true. as far as the rest of the world is concerned, and also the people of the united states who may not participate as much in the affluence that we all would like to share, i think that's what space flight in general and the apollo program in particu- lar has offered, is many new avenues from which we can provide for those people abroad and for our own people, the kind of quality of life and the mate- rial - including the material quality of life that everybody aspires to. i think we've just begun the adventure of understanding how - what we've learned and how we've learned to do it in space can be ap- plied to these particular kinds of problems. that is one of the great challenges that i think nasa and other agencies within the united states govern- ment and other governments abroad have, is to use this base of technological information now for their own people."
... handle it ... soviets ... eat their heart out ...
roger.
"okay, in order to have good comm, - man, you just disappeared - got the spotlight on. i tell you, the spotlight isn't nearly as good as earthshine. i'm really surprised. -- transcript of communications between cc and lm resumed apollo 16 air-t0-ground voice transcription 0_ 05 _5 xx begin lunar rev 15"

(laughing) yes.

okay.
"yes, i think you're in good shape. yes, i don't have any other choice. matter of fact, if there is a scarp, and if it is a fault, i'm right - right on it because the projection of it would be uphill a little bit."
wonder what we're going to do without our high gain? we'll have to go on omni's most of the way.
"roger; we'd like the ir cover, closed, and the uv cover, closed, at this time."
"okay, ken. we concur as long as it's 1-foot down radial. 04 06 24 31 cm2 okay, it'll be 1 foot towards the moon, and we'll still count from 1 to 2 foot per second on the noun 85. 0_ 06 24 40 cc roger."

"yes, that's affirmative. and that's right where i'm at now, just south of archimedes and this - hummocky, hilly terrain south of archimedes is, in fact, quite full of - of rilles, although they're very subdued rilles. they - they don't have much definition to them, even in this low sun angle. but, they're combinations of linear rilles, which seem to run northwest, southeast and sinuous rilles, which have no particular direction. and then, i noticed a couple of rilles have - in fact - i'm looking at one right now. in this, we see a small crater pair just to the left of archimedes and a real light feature running to the east out of it. and that rille feature has a - a series - a whole succession of - of craters run - running right down the rille."
...
"roger. we were more curious about the rela- tive amount of moisture between, say, last night and the night before, both of which would have the lm missing."
they're white halos; it just has more of them.

and the - we're - mag - oscar oscar is on 93 now. the last three pictures were that trio.
roger.
"okay. so that gives us a good platform. now the lm will maneuver to the jettison attitude, and the only thing of significance here is that you want to watch to make sure that the path they choose to go to the jettison attitude avoids gimbal lock on your own platform."
"that's affirmative, but i did not get a barber pole on the door. it just stayed gray."
i don't have any i - (laughter) i don't have any idea. i hope not - they don't make this ll against one. he really likes them. 319
"hope the door opens, charlie."
"now, look, i'm going to yaw back to the left."
here i come. do do de-dum.
...
did you get some interior photos?

we're still here.
okay. lmp-eya how's the gravimeter doing?
"stand by, houston."
"*** reading him? ed, are you reading?"

_a_llright. let's get them.
yes.
"okay. but all i'm saying is that the buss samples have never flown before. _p yes, the eva umbilical bag is snapped on there. okay. they're hooked up there, but let me make sure it's hooked down at the bottom this time."
okay. why don't you pick it up here.
*** water's off. set that there for a minute. okay; hang on. okay; you're in and locked. *** over nicely. okay. ls_ okay.
"let's see. let me go back to my - well, i almost got into gimbal lock (laughter)."
okay.
"okay, we've got that; 25 degrees."
you want 2?
"a:ra,zing .... residuals ... the whole thing on rcs."
yes.
"you know, that - no - yes, i didn't - i didn't even realize you could cut it off. if i'd known that, i'd have cut it off before. yes. if i'd cut it off like that, i'd have my curly locks shaved off in front."
"that's affirm. next. lm flight data file. that will go in r-i, r-2, and r-3. next. three ppks in a-8."
"okay. you got your eva - on 603, eva 02 is on. is it - is it still on, or have you got it off?"
"okay, fine."
"you know, it's _'eal funny there in antarctica the - you can see the snow, but there isn't any weather at all in it. ail of the weather's around it in the water."
"okay. 07 08 26 52 i_ okay, we can pro out of there. ags has got minus 0.3 - minus 4 - plus 39. that's right. okay. stop that. turn the page. okay. ags mode control, att hold. p37 - max noun 49's a 0.8 and 0.5 - and 5.0. okay, do you want to do a verb 67?"

okay - -
"okay. i am in auto dump and i'll have to wait until we get in daylight to go down there, i think."
"roger, jim. we understaud you are going to delete the u¥ photograph, but after you complete the corona window cslibration, you will have to do the first step in the uv photos transearth coast procedures, there. and that first step is verb 49 maneuver to earth uv photo attitude, and _ it lists the attitude there. we need this for thermal reasons."
"al, elvin heard that, and he feels crushed. !05 22 29 52 cmp well, tell him not to worry. i'm sure it's there and i'll - i've just got to get a little bit fur- ther south around the edge of the crater."
"jack, wait - wait - wait a minute before you - hey, bob, are we going to need those other core tubes?"
"dave, as long as you keep those circuit breakers out, there's no reason we can't leave that light on. we need it on for the test anyway."
"okay. i got two of them in there, too."
"roger. apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription _-_ 09 03 23 13 cc endeavour, houston."
"jack, wait a minute. let me copy some of this down. oh 10 35 34 cc okay."
"yes, just behind you is one of those fresh craters, too, with a lot of glass in it."
stand by; stand by 1.
station 8.
thing's pretty steady.
stand by.
we have to proceed there %mtil we get the noun 70 display.
"it's never too late to learn. lmp-i_ for you, i'd believe that; for a lot of people, i wouldn't."
it's coming up. we'll be getting some altitude here in a minute.
"i got us about 22-1/2 minutes from undocking, and i'm at 3 psi, looking in the tunnel. let's wait another minute to get _t bled down. 03 23 51 11 _ answer him, john."

"it's orb rate, charlie."
"okay, joe, i've got a clear status report for you."
okay. fine.

"okay, let me disconnect your hose - done. 0b 18 37 50 cdr okay."
"that's pretty good, fred."
"okay. and were those last high gain - i guess they're still good, huh? you want the high gain on it?"
"wheel boy, when you do this, and you go downslope, that first step is a long one."
"okay, and first, the long stem is in."
pro when you pitch. 00 03 04 08 cmf yeah. and it's a verb 61.
okay; we'll get the ems normal at 0.05 g.
what is it? 03 08 38 21 cml° okay. main b undervolt; turning the pan camera back to standby.
"and, houston, could you give us an approximate time to turn off the ascent 02 in case we're losing point with you?"
okay. you're going to mearn - earn your american meteorological society badge here pretty quick.
i can use the thruster configuration i have now.
"casper, houston standing by."
okay.
roger.
"the bottom one will be number 11tube with a tab, fredo. got 2 there?"
"okay, i copy that."
"good number, i guess, huh? ..."
"and, al, without taking any extra time, if you - -"
it's an honest-to-god unstability in the servo loop.
"that's affirmative. we need them closed to power the switches. next on panel 5, we want the eps sensor signal main a and main b circuit breakers closed. over."
"okay, it's there."
"okay, good."
vhf antenna is aft.
i got nothing else in there we need. here's some tape. do we need that?
okay. okay.
looks like it's .... ...
okay. glad we learned about those -
more cables all over the place here than i know what to do with.
that sounds like a dented tire; that's how it sounds.
we concur.
"how about that? (laughter) a new first. this is so super. oh, boy. okay, three hedc, two d sacks, and 500 under the seat. and look at all of the little goodies. uh-oh. 01d velcro man did it again."
"i believe it! 0b 06 39 16 lmp yes, sir, that was beautiful."
"s-band t/r, off."
"okay. i copy. delete the ""waste water dump."""
"oh, okay."
we're going right down u.s. 1. (eagle)
there's one right by the gnomon we can just pick up. it's a finer-grained vesicular rock than - wait - where - -
roger.
"houston, apollo 11. the dsky's yours."
"okay. hod, jack, when you get out to the sep site, you might give us a reading on what the solar panels look like - how they survived the night with the tape on them. lmp-e_ i wouldn't think of not doing that. i'm curious myself. 05 18 ho 32 cdr-eva okay. the tge is on the lrv."
"well, i think that rock - i think it's - it's just a little secondary impact crater. very funny ... boy, is that a funny rock - it looks -"
okay. 06 22 22 15 ia_p-eva okay. most of the rocks here are - are rounded; have some real good secondaries. the types are very difficult to identify as we go by. me're now at 193 at 1.7. the nav system seems to be working super.
"okay. we'd like to look at it for just a little while before we power d}wn the pgns, so stand by."
see what's next on the agenda here.
wonder why that light won't go out?
huh?
"i got to pull the flap up on this side, jack. you'll have to get it on the other."
"the sun would have been some better - it would have been better if it could have been a little bit higher. because when i went down around the side of the mapping camera, it was pretty dark."
"orion, stand by for tweak."
you want me to try auto again?
ail right.
"okay. on row 2, we're going to open up ascent feed 2 and ascent feed 1 wider rcs system a. we're going to open up the mission timer, and fligiit displays: the gasta and the ordeal; and the ac bus a: the gasta."
okay. we can see the thruster activity on the s-ivb.
yes. 06 00 28 lb cdr-eva just get in front of me and give me your hand.
"okay, let's put it right up in there. 04 19 58 59 lhp righ% up there, on that spot? 04 19 _9 o1 cdr yes, you got it. okay, houston. wetre going to move about 10 meters to the west-northwest from those coordinates th._t ed gave you. that will be waere the alsep central station will go. we reserve the right to change our mind as to where we are, when we get up on the hilltop. o_ 19 59 26 cc okay."
p64 - -
what?
okay. is it going to stop by itself?
"good morning, 16. how are you this morning?"
okay.
"roger. again for fuel-consumption reasons, we'd like you to go back to the ags mode you were in rather than pgns att hold. over."
ready for the gimbal test option. 03 ih 07 18 cmp i'm ready. up 2. down 2.
"how does the barber pole look up there_ boys? cml° ..., gene. 09 15 11 20 i_mp it looks gray. okay, ..."
"okay, jack, i'm going to turn these lights off."
it's all - everything here is dust covered.
"and that was a good one, al. and if someone who's not just looking out the windc_ will give us p00 and accept, we'll send you up a - not p00, just accept. pardon me. we'll give you state vectors and a target, while we're taking a view."
i guess i don't blame you. i'd have thought you'd have put in plus--x and rose over the top of us.
"and this is the first time now, looking back toward the sun where i've been able to see that ray from - that's supposed to be a tycho ray isn't it - going right across bessel in the north-south direction?"
"well, the cobbles and boulders are picking up. we're at 26, tony, at 199, 192, and beginning to pick up a high frequency, maybe 10 percent now, of cobbles and boulders. john, i think it looks like those - see that white boulder dead ahead? looks like the greatest variety of boulders is going to be over there. but that's part of the east and our station 11, but farther north than station 11 is called for. it's almost at the foot of smoky."
"and, jack, we've turned off the waste dump heater. if you're going to consider dumping any more waste water, we probably ought to do it while the duct is warm there."
...
"roger. 06 01 52 57 cdr-im hey, joe. this is gene."
"... 06 21 34 47 cdr-i2,_ ... ! always have had mine do_m. 06 21 34 50 i2'4p-12q i agree with you. can't believe that shadow .... rphat kind of ... sun angle we got now, tony? 06 21 35 16 cdr-i2_'] see if my water flag has cleared yet. o6 21 35 18 u_.p-d,_ ..."
the thing wouldn't stay on a minute ago; now it won't come off.
"yeah, tony, that was - i was just going - to add to that i was just - i had the same impression. looking at the - the south ray, with the black and white streaks up the wall - up on the interior of the crater, and also at baby ray, being very stark in contrast. and then at north ray, having that same impression but more subdued. and the rocks appearing to be very similar - -"
"(laughter) okay. i'll do that. oh 10 40 04 cmp jack, as luck would have it, we just now started to vent a little from the command module ..."
say again about umbilical. all i get is umbilical. i didn't get the question.
"man, vhat ordeal is tracking right on - 39 on the tape, 39 there - 136, 136. state vector's super."
"but it's still got 50 pictures or so. now, watch it; make sure it takes a picture each time it turns."

"*** happy, geno."
"okay. burn was on time, and it was a 3-second burn. we had about 1.0 or 1.1 residual, and that was trimmed to 0.1, minus 0.2, minus 0.2. delta-v c was minus ll.0; fuel, 26.50; oxidizer, 26.25."

that's good.
"yes, we understand. _"
i guess you did not.
"well, let's see, this is east - looks awf - it's a double crater but it's much bigger than i thought rudolph would be."
"_ell, it's my fault."
"okay. and then just for your information - you won't have to do it - but we're going to play the old simulator step-ahead game at 66 hours of the old time, which will be 65 hours of the new time. so however you want to call it, we'll call you; and we're going to sync you up at 67:40 at that point. we'll play the old step-ahead game there."
"also for this damping, we want you to go to the jets called out at 240:50 in the flight plan. that's a - well, you got it there. _p yes, we got it here."
"kitty hawk, hcuston."
how about that - package out of your - brief. get that? 04 15 36 54 _ no.
"just like in the owner's manual, dave."
not yet. what does that look like on the monitor?
okay.
"ymerica_ we'd like (}_i delta, please."

"we'll give you a call on that. 06 09 59 18 cdr-i_ 3kay, is it the same as it was in the activation checklist?"
could you see them?
"god damn, i'm still cold."
"no. that's - that's fine with us. 05 08 28 0s cmp okay. i've got my tone booster hooked up. and if you want me, send a crew alert and i'll come talk to you."
"sounds good, houston. the ride was very nominal. we a little vibration, though, during most of the rlln."
"okay, deleted the verb 48 at 97:15; and _hat's be- cause we'd already set it; affirmative?"
"i've got it. okay. man, oh man."
"okay. we cut off on a vi of 35,614. tfc was plus 02; vg was plus 145; delta-v c was minus 14.9. and i've got the h-dot now, if you want it. h-dot was 4353, and altitude was 167.4."
you might have to do a 360 down there and unwind this hose.
"endeavour, this is houston. we'll be coming up on your camera cycling in about 15 minutes. it's for your own planning, and we'll cue you when we're ready for that."
"i don't know whether you have any connections with all the marines stationed in antarctica, but maybe somebody knows what the ice pack's been doing the last few days."
anybody got any suggestions down there on how we can warm up the cabin a little bit? it's getting a little cool in here. can we go - do like we did on launch day or whatever it is and maybe run the secondary loop without any coolant on it or something? time skip
"okay. we made a little money, didn't we?"
(music) trying to get some more of this good food down.
okay; mine's pulled. - tape 77a/_5
"and, 16, we've got a correction to the g&c checklist, page 9-4, whenever you get ready to copy."
"17, houston. omni alfa. 11 12 38 08 imp you got it."
"well, you know, i don't think we need to worry about the antennas, but let me get yours. golly, look at the top of your - let me worry about that; let me get the top of your plss cleaned off. 07 02 56 26 _p-eva okay."
here you go.
"okay, houston. i'll go through verb 25, noun 07, down through verb 34 enter, and i'11 stand by."
okay; we understand.
roger. dave - we copied.
let's t_ry it this way. it didn't lock up though.
"okay, we're - 0ooohl we almost ran in the middle of a big crater."
mike. mike mike. there he is. that was on mag - mag - mag oscar oscar_ by the way.
"okay, let's let her go. 07 03 28 00 cdr-i_m okay, here comes tank 1. and we'll stand by for your call for tank 2."
- - that scarp. 05 23 b6 27 lmp-eva okay. the soil is in 44 yankee.
roger.
"okay. page 5-10 on the lunar surface checklist. the reason for this change is to prevent cabin pressure from increasing. it got up to 5.7 yesterday. and it also - will also prevent water sep spindown like happened yesterday, if you happen to have the hose - the return hose blocked against the wall outlet there. the change is to write in on the upper left corner of 5-10, just prior to ""suit isol, actuator override (suit disconnect)."" write in ""pressure regs a and b to egress."" and then down five lines, where it says ""cabin gas return, egress,"" change it to ""cabin gas return, auto."" verify. over."
"casper, we have the angles. you're clear to start."

was it the one about turning inverter 3?
let me get over there.
okay. we're sta_iding by until we get data. 07 05 09 50 l_-lm okay. 07 05 10 42 _4p-_4 you must have a big dish of some kind. you're clear as a bell.

yes.
"okay; i copy, bob."
"okay, understand. it's right in the middle of the picture now. okay. i think we're seeing some of it now."
"well, i think - the magnitude of the scientific '-'-'"" data we return will speak for the taxpayers' money. the small amount of time they had for television, i think, is rather insignificant relative to the amount of return we've gathered in the sim bay and in the lunar samples we have aboard right now. i think these data will not only en - enhance the progress of science, but it will reach the common man on the street directly by the - the byproducts of what we learn. i think man must extend himself, the new frontiers must be open in order for us to - to propagate m_nkind, and i think this is one way in which we do it. i - i feel that the taxpayers got, probably - as a matter of fact, i hope they got more than their money's worth out of the flight. and, if you could see the size of the film maga- zines that a1 brought in yesterday from those ca- meras, why, you'd see that we have indeed at least a great deal of data on film alone."
there are a bunch of little specks or spots all over the outside of it. it looks like dust that's collected there. window 5 is almost clear.
"loud and clear, geno."
okay.

"no, i'm doing fine."
"okay. okay, don helmets we've done; checked drink bag; lower protective visors."
"okay, joe; you're going pm1/wb."
okay. 3 2 1 -
"okay. houston, the way i had to set it to keep the - to keep the - to make it stand up against the strut, it's about, i'd say it has an angle of 50 or 60 degrees to the sun. and the sun is shining on the back of it, because the strut won't shield it completely, if you know what i mean. the base of it is down in the footpad, and the top of it is out - sticking out past the strut."
"oh, no. we - we - we want the switch in zero. 03 04 35 58 l_[p do ycu?"
"joe, we've talked it over, and we think the best _-- thing to do is to stick exactly with the plan we have now. i think we understand what we're looking for, and even though we didn't find any - some of the things we were looking for today, that doesn't mean that we won't find them as we head down to front crater. and i - i guess about the only input we'd have would be that, if we can make as good a time on the rover tomorrow as we did today, perhaps we'd have more time to sample a - a variety of stations along the front and on the way back. but, in general, i think we'd do better if we stuck with our preflight - preflight plan."
"okay, the noun 20 values - noun 20 values - after the 90 degree roll there and for the final trim were 270, 179, 317."
"and what would be nice for you to do, jack, if you can - -"
okay.
"i'll tell you what. i do remember - one time in the middle of the first one, i looked back ... like ..."
"hurry, quickl"
#** think of any place i'd rather be right now.
there's another one of those little particles. r
"the central peaks do stand out, though, as a much lighter albedo area within the crater. it looks to me like the best thing you can do in earthshine is work with albedos. knowing the general topog- raphy from the - from the pre - earlier photog- raphy. we're coming up on kepler now. copernicus is out of e_fview in window 5. maybe ron sees it. do you, eon?"
"that's affirmative. i got secs arm, two, close, verify."
roger.
now let the rate damp there for a second; hope it improves.
"ah, oh, eat it'"
"that's right, son of a bitch."
"okay. i'm ready, l, 2, 3, 4 - tvc servo power 1 and 2, off."

"okay, bob. you can see we're up over one of the littrow rilles now. you can see the rille cutting diagonally there from about - 6 o'clock to 2 o'clock across the picture, and you can see some of the wrinkled ridges. in fact, there's a beautiful wrinkled ridge right below us right now."
"ed, you won't believe the size of that hole back there. you just won't believe the size of that hole behind the lm."
you're looking right ...
yeah.
"okay, houston. bat c is 37; pyro bat a is 37; pyro bat b, 37."
"good readback, ken."
"we got that, babe. we'll see you coming around."
i've got to go uphill.
he's looking now.
"deke says get a night's sleep. he says you've been working hard, and you ought to relax a little bit and be ready for tomorrow."
how close can soil be to this back plate of the alsep?
"go ahead, aquarius."

i will. we got a minute and a half.
"that's not possible, so the only thing that really - we think could - the tank is too much of a heat sink to do it that way. what may have happened was that if you set up an oscillation - a mechanical oscil- lation in the tank - through - one way or another, that this could then have acted back up on the motor. but the motor switch in driving the heaters could not have reinforced the oscillation because the tank is too much of a heat sink."

roger.
okay.
"okay ... get it up there and get it going , we'll be all right .... why don't you run one across this way? now hold it."
roger. our mocr's about empty right now. we're taking it a little easy. how does it feel up there to have some company? (goss net 1) tape 84/7
"okay, karl. and if you're ready, i'll give you the rest of the burn status report. it's just the emf and things like that."
"well, let me tell you a few things first, bob."
we'll be waiting for you. we're here.
"- - it's staying in inertial, and we're going orb rate now."
pyros are armed.
"... live the rover, huh, geno?"
"on the southwest flank of plum - on the southwest flank of plum, we have a buried boulder, and it's about a meter across. and that's the only boulder we see of any consequence here at plum. in spook - in flag, on the southwest rim about halfway down into the crater, we see a block that's sticking out, that 's very angular, that 's maybe 2 meters across, and it's in an area of whiter albedo. it's probably a buried block. i wouldn't call it bedrock. i see nothing that looks like bedrock."
- - let's just stop here.
"when you almost get there, how about ...?"
"apollo 13, houston. stand by for mode iv capability."
"okay, jim. and, we assume, in the meantime, you're pressing on here."
"roger. that's correct, and we'll go ahead and watch tank 2. if it doesn't - tank 2 doesn't decrease, we'll tell you to close the ascent feeds and open the shutoffs. over."
"okay, it's 10 seconds. looks good - indicator light. this one. that always comes on on test 1, i don't know - .05 g light always comes on test 1. okay? and still got two of them left. let's try number 2, i guess. never pass up a gas station, if you really need it. okay, test 2."
does that mean i'm clear to do a verb 46?
we're in good shape.
"you haven't been on the rover yet. it's real easy, but it's also very easy to kick dust all over those battery covers, so don't even get on it until i put those bat covers down."
"well, if we can't fill up the lmwith everything else."
cobra cable's coming out. 05 10 51 16 _mp i think it made it in the back. here we go.
okay.
yes. we can get all that stuff done ...
"i was in high bit rate for the burn, (laughter) because we have - we missed that ags .... - -"
"well, i almost tried - oh, yeah, we're - heading is 1 - bearing to the lm is 033, the heading is 195."

"jack, houston. how long did you hold proceed before you quit on it?"
"if we pull this off, we could be slicker than owlshit."
"houston, aquarius."
okay? okay. now we need boulder stuff.
let the dynamics die out just a little.
"and they seem to be quite distinct. at least you notice them. now, whether it's just a continuation of the mantling, i don't know. but - the - most other boulders - the big ones seem to be - project above the surface more than just that 5 or l0 centimeters."
"yeah. i don't - i don't think there's any relation between any of these failures, one to another. i - i don't think there's any common thread. i agree with ken. it's very complicated gear. it has to run for long periods of time, and you've got to expect some times that it won't run, and you got to know how to fix it, and that's why they send us on these trips."
"oh, i wouldn't think so, dave."

uh-oh.
"okay. well, see, push them all back in over here, anyway."
"from this distance, the color is very much the same as it was when we were orbiting it. /'_d that is that no three men on any one crew can agree on what the color really is."
"(laughter) hew are you doing down there, ...?"
"dave, i'm going to start getting in."
"that's negative, ken. and, if you will give us accept, we'll get on with your state vector updates. stand by - that's clock update."
hello_ america. how are you doing?
"okay. on my mark; 3, 2, i -"

we can take the rake sample near the rover. right?
"it's one of the better views we've had of the states, i think, even though we're quite a ways out."

yes. we're trying to - - lml°-eva right over here.

"man, i just figured it out."
"17, houston."
go ahead.
"okay. yes, we'llbe using it on the way home. but we can put it away for now. it's probably just as well."
the lock lock is down and it's verified low and the pin still is in. okay. look at mine while you're there.

"3, 2, 1 -"
"well, i just - yes, i almost lost a pass here, _ld just a couple more words about australia. as a - as a general landmass, it's red. very strong red hues, except for the north and eastern coasts, where that red gradually merges into a greenish- gray. it's as - as red as portions of - of northern africa appeared to be yesterday."
thank you.
"roger. cut. ten seconds - 05 22 14 23 i3_p yes, we lost them."
okay. let me lift it up and do it. *** wait a minute. i've got to tweak this thing. now shove it in. right now.

"no, jack's still sacked out."
"and the rover sample will be from the same locality. boy, it's just a couple of meters from the charge, isn't it?"

"yes. understand. okay, one garbage bag. anything else in there you want to get rid of?"
"houston, 17."

okay.
that's soil. i can't see to get a rock.
"no, don't we have the vacuum hose? lo o7 55 16 cmp ..."
"16, houston. goldstone says they're getting a good picture, and so your trouble is with the ef- fort there, and we'll start the evasive burn at 4:18 even."

"apollo 1t, this is houston. mike, we're still getting a flat trace on you for the impedance pneumograph. before you turn in this evening, you might try putting some fresh paste in the sensors, and if that doesn't work, the medics have agreed to forget about it. over."
"eagle, houston. if you have time, pitch 162, yaw minus 16."
we are. it really is fun.
get a load of this crazy juggling act.
"okay. and if the she tank does burst during this time frame before we get trajectory info, why, that will delay our tra_ectory info somewhat. your consumables, your rater is now good through 152 hours."
roger.
"boy, is that him?"
"also, as a matter of general interest, the sun should be in - at the bottom part of the cdr's window at the bottom of the lpd vertical line."
"yes, we're -we're going to press on slowly through the system prep - preps for depress, and just to make sure we don't run into any problems there, and we'll probably - probably call a pseudo hold before i take any checks there, we'll take a look at it."
(singing)
okay.
"jim, just make sure you are well clear of the antenna, with your plss there, old friend."
yeah.
"yes, i turned it off. i turned it off. okay. let me see. we want to move on to 7 here. rake, talus, doc_nented core, you got your stereos, we got two pans, tge, camera. okay, we're going to head east and look for station 7 - block variation, contact change, and get a different sample of rocks. okay, i sure want to get one or two of those nice ones in the big bag while you're over there."

okay_ tony. i picked up thav white -
no. i'll just take it to it. let me know when you're ready for a pan.
"that's affirmative. okay. when that's complete, the lm will maneuver to the sun-viewing angle for attitude. and when they get there, you take a mark on the sun using the sun filter and the telescope; and, again, we're marking on the center."

but there are very few of those.

go ahead.
what do you want to do with it?
how's that?
roger; we're still here.

"why don't you get off, jack? oh, i was looking at the wrong - oh, no, i'm not. okay. i'll get a nav update. get off and look around. i'll give them a nay update, jack, and we'll press on."
"okay, america. we're ready for the hf antenna extend test, and, just for your information, white sands got one of the rockets off. the other one was a no go."
outstanding.
"overhead or forward dump valve, open, then auto - at 3-1/2 - verify cuff gage does not drop below 4.6. you gonna get the overhead -"
"well, we both slept for the full time, and we'll get the prd readings if required in a little bit."
okay.
... good.
okay.
]t looks like - -
"wivhin 7 feet per second, it looks like."
"this side looks okay, dave."
"and, if you have the consumables update, i'll take that, too."
roger.
"- and, geno, you're leaning pretty heavy forward on that drill."

this one over here underneath the ascent engine where the probe first hit - the minus-y probe firs t hit.
"... don't want any electrical thingamajigs to get in. you're supposed to put it in the - back in the front window. you want to do it? okay? see, that fills up the slots."
roger. wait until you get the tone. just wanted to warn you.
"okay, 00, 176, 0."
- - because this is going to want to turn it over.
okay.
that makes me feel like i'm coming over to do some sampling. think how it would have been if you were standing there before that boulder came by.
okay; doff the gloves and stow on the comm panel.
okay.
"roger, dick. we concur on that."

"oh, boy. tape78a/32"
small rocks and smaller - -
"okay, it's off."
okay.
okay; drill.

"okay, all you flash bugs down there - or flash- bulbs i guess is the word - frame 50. i just took four pictures to show - two on the side and two on the bottom - to show the position of the alfmed, and one of them of each set was focused on the alfmed. the others were focused on the - the other set was focused on the struts."
okay. call it off.
"okay, bob. thank you for a job well done."
"well, you just bent over and some real nice cold air - is it coming out of your suit? yes. oh, man, is that nice!"
think that ought to work?
okay. we're just going around the room on that one. and we'll have an answer in a second here.
i wouldn't - i wouldn't whistle around the block for it. especially after i had so much trouble with that bag.
... back down there ... go to off.
"i get it - no, i get it, babe. it's in there. lnp-eva okay."
i think you can stop it right now.
"roger. we agree. 06 20 50 50 i_mp-eva oh, yes. i can't - i really can't te - really can't tell how wide it is, but at the very sh - -- shallowest - or the deepest portion of it, it looks like there's a - a crater."
how's - bow's aw_rica looking to you?
"... that one. 03 oh 33 19 lmp see it coming, ken?"
roger. that's cricket.
"okay. it sounds good. we think so, too."
"al, we're still not getting a good picture. why don't you press on, and we'll try to get back to it later, if ye have time."
"dave and jim, the first thing we need is just a good sampling stop - -"
"great. i think, just to clean this place out a little bit, i'm going to take some of these bacon squares and throw them."
"gee whiz. that's not bad for a three rev slip, huh?"
copy 560.
"oh, i - -"
about 8 minutes.

yes. we got more yellow pills than we know wha_ to do with.
"that's a good plan, ken, and the - where we are going to pick up the flight plan again is at 168:30, to start preparing for rendezvous, and from 168:30 on to 175 hours, if you add 4 hours to all of those times, they're close enough that we can use them all the way through the rendezvous."
right down here? okay.
"okay, that was about a 5-footer, tony. a little down-sun, and the shovel is right where the - -"
roger.
"okay. right - right up side of the hatch, now. cam:lng in the klatch, it's all yours. okay. do ycu have it?"
"yes, we were going to steal jack's thunder and take a - take our own weather report when we had the tv looking at the earth here a little bit ago."

"yes, it's the comm. very bad, aren't i?"
"for a 10-minute stop, dave, i don't think the rake is - -"
beautiful.
i'll bring your camera out.

"like driving a camel. 06 02 02 55 i/mp-eva yeah. and, tony, over on - smoky, it doesn't appear - i can see the lineations over there, but the - they are more widely spaced than - than on stone here and mostly parallel to the cayley. bear - bear left a little bit, john, if you can. there's a - okay, we're at 3. we can start looking for a place now."
roger.
huh?
"that horizon isn't much, is it, al? l0 04 13 09 ibip no. it must have been there all along; it was just gray - -"
...
"but i'll tell you wnat's on the horizon now. i'm not sure i can get it. let me try the rendezvous window. i think i can show them apollo ll's land- ing site. l]_p you can probably get it at the south portion of tranquiliity there, if you - out the center window would be betver."
... -eva .··
easy.
"yes, you can really see when you are going right over imbrium and - serenitatis."
i'm going to work on it; that's what i'm going to do. whoa; hold still.
"(laughter) that's true. this is our normal reset burn, right here."
"hey, better get another one."
- - range and bearing?
and 7 under the lmps seat.
"battery manifold? it was i.2, about. and it was that last night, too."
okay.
how much have we got? l0 00 55 43 cml° we got another - charlie's got to get his in there and i got to get in mine in there.
"i'll work on that, gene. you go ahead with the other - -"
what was that for?
i hope to beck it does.
"according to the instructions, that's correct."
"roger. at about 148 hours, if you've not already done so, a co2 filter change, and the h2 purge line heater on 20 minutes before the 02 and h2 purge. at 148 hours, we'd like you to initiate a charge on battery alfa instead of at 151 hours, and leave the charge on until we notify you further. at 150 hours get, waste-water dump to l0 percent. we do plan to burn midcourse cor- rection 5. it will be an rcs burn about 5 feet per second at about the nominal time in the flight plan. over."
*** that tape has had it.
"okay, ken, we got cabin gas ret_n, auto."
the next frame will be for 60 seconds ....
okay. i'm coming up on 45 seconds.
"okay, ""battery management at 164 hours and 45 minutes."""
"okay. good. we're supposed to look we_t for copernican rays here, too."
okay. that was just me moving my head just a little. let me move it again. sorry i didn't mention it. i didn't know it was going to make any noise.
"okay, and on the mass spec, there's nothing there but the door wide open. was there something in particular you'd like me to look at back here - on the mass spec?"
"well, jack, we copy your information. and we'd like to hold off because we're still working the problem. so we'll have to give you information later."
"i'm not going down that critter. (laughter) 06 04 39 07 _p-eva _aat is really steep. look at that. 06 c4 39 09 cdr-eva look at that hole in the bottom of i_. 06 04 39 10 i_p-eva i know it. tony, it's a - a - a subdued crater without any rim at all. it is sort of oblong - -"
yes. no?
no. did it come up to you?
"11, this is houston. on our tm, here, we're only seeing values in two registers. can you read us out the contents of register 3, please?"

"yes, sirree; it's - -"
"aquarius, houston."
"yes. why don't you get 5 out, and i'll start on the core."
okay.
"okay. and, jack, we're not sure you went to aux on your water yet."
- - eps. checking them off.
we didn't tell them about those leak checks.
okay. that was going to be a question of mine.
yeah?
yes. let me have it. ail right?
okay -
"okay. what? that's probably the next thing we'll try. however, the relay switch must be working_ if - you were reading him. (cough) houston, one minor suggestion: remember we have been in secondary transmitter/receiver since before pdi, and i don't know that we've ever established that our primary is good or not good. onfide"
"off to the right toward that - which we described going out, now i can see four or five 2-meter- size boulders, whitish in color, with no fillets around them."
"okay. and in that space in between that update _nd the lm lift-off is a nice place to write. let's put in there first, ""optics mode, cmc, verify."" underneath that, let's write a note. ""spacecraft control must be in scs prior to optics mode, manual."" i'm just reminding you of the note that - that we passed on the other night, ken."
okay. roger. 00 02 28 42 i_p nice start.
okay.
"okay, gordy."
"okay. that's all i can handle up here. *** one more, and i cau put it up here."

"no. i don't - no, i don't think so. go way down in there. let me get a couple of after pictures. yes, we want to get two sides of these rocks, and you can see their structure."
mark it.
"and, 17, we'd like the sep blankets opened and dusted one more time."
"falcon, this is endeavour reading you 5 square in duplex b."
okay.
okay. cdr-_ okay. that's good. lmp-_4 let's get another zap of water here.

"hey, here's a rock they'll be glad to see in houston."
good. save a copy for me.
it'll be close.
understand .007. and was the - -
i think - -
"0kay_ why don't you read it to me, gordo? and i'll get it, in the leb dsky down here."
"okay, relative - right now, joe, our bearing is 18 and range is 2.3."
thank you.
probably what it is. (laughter) did you just pull it loose?
"hey, here's something that should go."
and we just changed lioh canister as per the flight plan.
that's affirmative.
"roger, jim. copy you loud and clear. superb."
"roger. okay. well, i'm not sure i can get down without ending up in your seat. f"
"hey, thank you very much. very enjoyable and also very appropriate."
okay; 30 seconds - -
okay. connect the lm 02 hoses. 04 22 42 38 _p okay.
...
"and, 17. gene, i guess you're the one that took the sep out. if you could give me - do you remem- ber the reading of the sep temperature when you broke it down?"
"okay, let's put that baby over here. that your last item?"
look at the light mantle over there.
(singing)
"got those numbers, charlie?"
"jim, just a reminder. any waste water dumped at this point would reall$ jiggle up the ptc prepa- ration, so request you save that until we're spun up. over. 03 0_)2'[49 cdr right. i dorl't think we'r,_ doin_ ar_y. ob 0'_a?'5¢2 (jo no. no, [ _or_'tt,hir_ :;o,but ] .lu:_twanted to make sur_,you were aware of it - i thought you were."
okay. good. because i - then i don't feel like i wasted so much time.
"i understand that it got a little warm during the day and cooled down a little bit when you put the shades up, but you're still a little bit warm. do you have any moisture condensation or an?thing like that on the wall? (goss net 1) tape 18/8"
"but when you go to couples, they still hang up there. and i ain't figured that out."
"odyssey, houston. over."
"we were just trying to give you a plug - welu, _' you don't want them - well, we'll take it back. (laughter) i shouldn't have said anything to the world's most experienced dlmp. right?"
okay. if you'll back into your corner so i can turn around. 04 19 13 31 _ ail right.
okay.
it sure sounds that way.
"we've got a - i guess probably the continent of africa dominates the world right now. it's cover- ing the - oh, the upper third - upper and western third of the - of the world. we can see the sinai_ we can see up into the mediterranean; we can see across the mediterranean, although we can't quite make out the countries up there; we can see across into india. i catch a glimpse of australia out in the far horizon. got zanzibar on the southern tip of africa, the cape do_m there just almos_ directly below us. and, i don_t know exactly how bi_ antarctica is, but i guess we can cer_ainiy see more than 50 percent of it. and - the rest of it is all ocean. the indian ocean out into the pacific ocean and back into the at]antic ocean. and for the most part relatively clear of clouds except in the antarctica region, and up towards europe which is - which is on the horizon, across the mediterranean, it looks like there might be some clouds back up in that way. i probably - probably - well, not probably - i can make out the entire coast of africa from mediterranean around to the west, coming back to the south back where it takes its big dip to the east, back around the cape, back around up through the suez canal, almost perfectly."
"i know, boy. okay, houston, i'm back. the sensor number i is on there and - -"
"if you're happy, i won't touch it."
except you can - -
"roger, jim. and we'd like you to give us your idea of how the ptc looks. we're not s_re we're seeing what we ought to here."
okay.
"what we're really trying to do is get you in a posture so that when you see the earth come through the window, you can damp her out and hold - hold the earth in the window. proceeding on to the rest of page 29, under ""rcs press,"" scratch the entire three steps as printed. on page 30_ scratch step 4 under the ""rcs press."" over."
we're ready to copy.
"houston, i'm - i'm not kidding; we are really getting dirty out here. there's no way to handle all this equipment with all the dust on it. every time you move something, the dust flies; and, in this low gravity, it really takes off, goes way up in the air, and then comes down and lands on you."
"okay, we're in p41. trim it out. there, attitude looks pretty good. okay. why don't you come up here and do your ks check? 03 23.46 09 cmp okay, dave."
"those ridges in, too."
i'm going to sleep underneath the couches like you_
that's right.
h_mm_ on the south rim of that crater.
i think - -
"yes, i guess that's right."
plss - -
i can look at them.
"try it now, loud and slow."
"i played with it for a while, and then got busy in other things. but i'll continue - i'll continue working on it."
jim thir_ks deke sounds like frank borman on apollo 8.
"near the twins i can see sever - several very large boulders. very angular, and i guess when i say large, they must be l0 meters across. they're sort of unique in the bottom of the rille. in that particular area, the other ones look like they're half the size anyway. and there does seem to be quite a bit of debris up there along where the twins are, up on the rim."
"""eva guards; left, center, and right, with straps."" they're in there. and the ""unipole - unipod pole assembly"" - - l0 07 57 _9 lmp wait a minute. wait a minute."
m_rk.
i got quite a bit.
that's right. that's right.
"okay, down voice backup, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. over."
plus 70.5.
sure.
"let me tell you, that does not apply to the little old farm boy from chicago."
"plus a - another couple little samples that were sitting there. okay, we'll get you - up. okay, hand me the hammer."
"okay. we're just about there in pitch and in ... middle gimbal angle, but that other gimbal angle didn't look like it pulled the right way. i tried both methods."
"look at that. it's right straight out one side. it - it would be a good place to take a radial sample. that thing came in from - let's see - _- we'll be going - - 06 02 55 56 irp-eva - - yes, we're going north - -"
okay. copy that.
think we lost comm?
that's affirmative.
go.
"okay. on the - on the coas, i've got him bore- sighted there, and he's 35559 from local vertical."
"where's the thc power? well, now -"
okay. thank you.
okay; plss mode for you to b and me to a. 05 21 5i 37 cc roger. and go on vo the next step.
"oh, that's - that's great, gordy. did kovach in- dicate his tentative depth for the second high- velocity layer?"
"go, houston."
...
"yeah, it does."
yes. that's 87:15:06.
"okay. the cowboy-redskin game just got started. it's now 7 to nothing, cowboys. they scored the first time they got their hands on the ball. lamp okay. i think we got most of that. it happened again, though."
*** 06 04 56 43 [_p-eva try another setting. how about an f/87
"gets pretty rough up ahead, dave."
"okay, ret 90k is 6:08."
"oh, don't worry about roll."
"apollo ll, houston. over."
"well, let me answer the last one first. i - i guess i didn't come in soon; i came in when the job was done. and, as a matter of fact, i made an extra trip back out to take a look at the map- ping camera. now as - as far as what i felt like when i went out there, we talked a little bit about it after - after the eva and decided it was sort of like walking on stage at your high school - dinner dance or something. we opened the hatch and it was pitch black, and as soon as we got out, the sun was beating down on everything, and it looked like a very large floodlight on a stage. and then putting the tv camera out on the door just added a little bit more to that sort of unreal feeling that it was time to get out on the stage and do something. i think, as far as the eva went, we - we did it just almost exactly as we'd practiced it. it took almost exactly the same amount of time; we did it the same way. and, of course, we had practiced out with the pan - with the mapping camera in the extended position, and so that - that really posed no difficulty to us."
"at the most, yes. that y-strut there is probably even less than that."
okay; the rest of the test was go.
"okay, we're copying that. and, if you guys are willing to do a little switch flipping this early in morning, we'd like you to turn on the pan cam- era heaters, which means if somebody's down there in that vicinity, it's sm/ac power, on, and the self test switch to heaters. over."
"okay, let me meet you out there. are you all done?"
"hey, what time did -"
roger. go ahead.
"yes, i noticed that (chuckle)."
if they'd have had the same problems we had on apollo 8 - borman was going out of his mind - he'd have shot himself. l0 00 02 0h cmp i don't really blame him.
i got to get a sample of that mother rock.
"yes, man."
"no, we'd like to take the tape from the cdrs seat and use it on the sep, right now."
"okay, it's on the backhand - back side, bottom ihalf, left-hand column, about an inch up from the bottom."
"yeah, open that water. forget that thing."
"roger. 7.4 and i had about 0.2 showing, i guess, when we started."
"sorry about that, jim. you sound like a1 these days."
"no, it's microbus [sic]."
...
"we've located it on tv, so we have it."
"okay, jim. we copy."
- - and the ordeal's already out; the coas is - -
is buzz holding your cue cards for you. over.
"jack, we'd like to take a look at the glycol pump pressure. can you close the glycol pump secondary pressure breaker?"
"well, i haven't been to the place where i could see that and look down on it. but during our first rev - after do - no - yeah. the first rev after doi, we passed right abeam of that guy and i got you a nice oblique shot of it from what looked like it was right next door. and it's got very sharp rims on it. it 's _ it 's got dark material around it, on the inside and the outside, and i guess it's draped. but it looked to me like it was a, you know, a very sharp feature. it had all the appearances of a - what you would think of as a fresh strata volcano would look like as a little bitty guy. and the white stuff looks like snow on it."
minus 15 seconds. 03 10 15 _4 lmp okay. that's where we've got it.
"ah, great."
quick one- think we've missed it. that's good.
"jim, this is houston. how are the eye flashes coming? 08 05 24 17 imp still waiting, joe."
"17, just for your information, it's _ami 3, baltimore 0 - they're about - baltimore 0 - they're about midway through the first quarter, and miami's making an effort to go undefeated today. lm/d it's the last game of their season, isn't it?"
got it.
"hi, jim. we've got a flight handover in abeut 2 minutes, and we'll have a temporary loss ef comm. you don't need to switch antennas. over. 03 17 58 )42 cdr okay; fine."
"okay, back to page 18. we'll continue on as is at 30 seconds, l0 seconds, 7 seconds, minus 5 seconds. at ""ignition,"" no ignition and we'll add here, ""no ignition, start pushbutton - push; still no ignition, descent engine command override, on."" over."
- - and try to lift it up.
"ken, houston. we would like to talk lo you a minute about this docking latch, if you're free."
and mind out for gimb_ lock.
"what we want you to do is be in scs control when you respond to that 204 display and make the burn in scs. and now, here again, i'm going to bring up another little pitfall. you want - down after tpi, you want to wait until the flashing 16 85 comes up before you go back to cmc. now, you know, tpi is a short burn and you could very well burn in scs on time and have a 99 flashing up there. go on_ get through that, and get into your flashing 16 85 before you return the - the spacecraft control to cmc. at least, by that, is what i'm trying to say, ken."
(laughter)
"(laughing) no, it couldn't have made that many. yes, we're going - at the base of the front, we're going down into a little depression that runs along the front. we came over another north-south trending ridge, and we're going down a little bit, and then we're going to start up again."
i think tridentts right here.
"- - ... you seen - have you seen the rocks that - on the - okay, that's what they all are."
"go ahead, houston; 17."
"well, let's see if i can partially get this hatch open."
"well, you said you wanted some tissues. they're right in there -right down under there. yeah. 03 10 36 43 iu[p ..."
okay. and it just dawned on me. i'm sorry about the zero on the noun 69. (laughter)
"for the lmp, for breakfast, don't scratch any- thing. for lunch, or supper, your choice, scratch the - turkey and gravy and add beef and gravy and scratch the vanilla pudding in a can; the white bread, 1; and the peanut butter. okay?"
"i got a bag coming up your side there. oop' hey, another one got away - the other two are up behind your head. can you reach them? 00 00 43 27 l_gp who, me?"
"go ahead, 15."
no. 101:52. so you got 8 minutes. 04 05 04 09 l_ (cough) okay. i think we're going to be ahead of it.
"diiie,ct, mwo, off. o3 zl. 05 l_ cmp off_. c nfidenti l"
"yes. sure do. stand by 1. w_'d like b[omei), left, please."
"yes, mine is."
"that's all new, what you call it - those sponges and stuff, you know. and, houston, i'm not - i'm not putting - putting any cover tape on it, so if it quits - you know, comes loose or some- thing like that, well, let me know and i'll push it on again."
that looks good. _y don't we go to a 0.2 and do il;just in the same place.
"then, our pr - okay, our passive dosimers [sic] are reading 22059 for john and 21123 for me."
where's the cosmic ray? did you put it in the etb already? i24p-eva yes.
outboards.
... get that ... right.
okay. sure didn't get much work out of the ags this time.
"hey, houston; 15. got any suggestions yet? we need to isolate this thing pretty quick."
"roger, eagle. good readback. out. 04 0t 24 18 cdr houston, this is eagle. do you want us to go ahead and do a verb 42 at this time?"
"roger, houston. this is falcon, ..."
"that's affirmative. above that whole sequence, we have some verifies for you. you can write this in about 134:50. actually, you better start - start a little higher to have room. ""verify all vhf off for sounder pass."" and here are the - the steps. ""vhf am, a and b, off. vhf am, receive only, off. vhf beacon, off. and vhf ranging, off."" four steps there. over. 05 10 14 46 cml° okay. we'll just verify that all vhf is off for sounder operations. vhf, a and b, off. receive, off. and receive only, off. beacon, off. and ranging, off."
*** it didn't look that big when we came over it.
"okay. i see there is this cloud concentration between new guinea and guam. the more i look at it the less well developed it appears to me compared to some of the other circulation patterns. it could be just a residual depression from teresa that has moved out into that area. it is an isolated, a relatively isolated cloud pattern, fairly small, but apparently fairly dense. but has - does not have a strong cyclonic pattern to it. nothing at all like the pattern that now exists above borneo and seems to be moving towards luzon."
"16, the computer is yours, and i have your tei-5 pad for the updates book. 03 05 46 05 cml° okay, hank, before we do that - looking at the change to the flight plan here, we got to load the verb 48 to put in the proper dap, and ... to start 509, and then go to the p52. can we go ahead and stop · the maneuver now and will this attitude clear enough things so we can get a p52 in there?"
"roger. we copy, charlie."
i'm not. you are.
you're coming by here anyway.
"i entered a range instead of a range rate. let me see what it says - let me see what it says. r-dot. see, bombed the hell out of it."
stu?
"and in a minute, i'll have weather report for you."
you never got the other one changed?
we aren't even counting ...
"okay. £0 nfid t tr , oh 22 42 15 lmp here's a rock. 04 22 42 ]6 cdr what'd we do with it? no, no, no, just five me the bag, the whole bag."
"okay, we gather you're on the way back to the lm with the core stems there, jack."
"i'd like to take a crap if i can work it in, dave."
"you get - don't mess up where the rock was, but pick up that little glass ball next to you, too. see that little glass ball next to where you scooped up?"
"go ahead, aquarius."
"partly blank. 06 01 l0 _3 cmp 106. 06 01 li _9 cmp well, the outer flanks of king look exactly like the central peaks in their characteristics."

we were just debating down here how come you guys threw away those nice clean gloves and kept the dirty ones.
"okay, jack."
we want to park. i don't think we'll see a blanket down - -
okay. the purge burn has been accomplished.
it's not in there now.
"well, tony, the old earth is boresighted in the sight."
ail right.
"okay, jim, your diverter valve - -"
don't you use that in your iv?
"every time he does that our hearts - our hearts jump in our mouth. and, jack, any time you want to terminate tv, we're all set to go."
"we copy those, geno."
"right. all of these, i think - three switches over there along the side. and beacon, ranging and -"
why do we get -
yeah. i would suppose that all of them - do you think all the blocks on the upslope side were the - were the - were the secondary that made it? don't you reckon - if it's from south ray? let me go down and sample off the rim - off the south rim.
roger.
okay. we copied that.
nothing obvious yet _ bob.
"okay, i'm going to take a little zig zag here - - 05 01 45 26 i24p-eva on the right is - -"
"houston, tranquility. we're not sure that we (tranq) got number 2 tank to fire. it's still showing a high pressure."
"yes. i guess. yes, *** okay, it's partially open."
"it - it'll come on, bob."
"16, houston. the booster is in attitude and stable. you have a go for t&d."
"roger; and the boys on the surface have the tv tuned up for us now, and we're getting some lovely landscape pictures - hadley delta, et cetera. those hills there are just beautiful, round, bare hills, a lot like the ones you see around san francisco. it's a beautiful sight. they're just about load- f- lng up the rover and getting ready to head off to- ward the south eom - first of all, to the rille for a quick visit and then off to the south complex. 06 19 47 44 c_p roger, karl; understand. and you say they are going to cut it a little bit short today?"
roger. over.
"okay, we'll get a picture of it."
"jhhso. well, i never did think it was a good idea to run those gimbal moto rs that long."
"yeah, that'll be just one small blip."
"mark. the gamma ray boom is on its way out with a barber pole. and i guess you'd like to have the shield off. _lite i'm about it, i'll do that. and i'm ready to copy your pads, or whatever things you said you had there."
... shortly.
roger.
"houston, when we do a water recharge, if we set the plsss on the floor or on the midstep, is this thing level enough so that we won't have a tilted plss as long as the plss is vertical? or in the - or in my station?"
you toc; you too.
yeah.
"yes, it's a little round, black - -"
okay. have you got the logic power enabled? 02 21 51 55 cml° no. i've got them - closed. they can't see it with the ... i'm down to here - three steps from jettison. there's - okay. i was gonna hold up on that. i'll go ahead and give you a logic power to jettison at this time.
you'll wish you hadn't asked.
okay .... go to mags.
"roger. you might as well start setting up for it, and we will be working the problem here."
"okay, and, charlie, go external on the lcru switch."

"houston, do you read apollo 117"
"five marks in, john. okay. you can - can i get a _ffrb 83?"
"15, houston. we hear that your attitude is very good right now; there's no need to trim the maneuver."
"well, if they don't want us to stop here, i guess we leave."
"stand by 1, charlie."
"okay, plss li0h cans, check the pins are in. green."
okay. what is it supposed to be?

yes (laughter). they got kind of a problem here.
is that right?
"you remember that fit check? '01 08 06 35 cmp oh, shit. 01 08 06 b6 lmp the vehicle with the - - 01 08 06 b8 cmp yes."
you have any flow scarps in that unit - near that menelaus crater?
all right.
"well, if that one showed up in the photos, i wonder why those down near the alsep didn't show up."
"jim, you're absolutely unreadable. i can't make out a word you're saying, usually."

"yes. after flying with stafford a couple of times and having that happen a few times back, i thought maybe he was aboard."
"looks like the tv's in standby, ken."
"roger, aquarius. we are reading you about the same, about 2-by. 03 01 03 34 imp okay."
"houston, you'd be happy to know that the moon, now, has finally gotten back to its normal size for us."
"casper, houston. are the gdc ball and the imu ball completely out of sync?"
that's fine. we just won't - bother the lm with it.
"okay, houston. about 3 minutes to go, a_ldwe're all squared away."
yeah. put ~ put the pad in the - in the book.

"and i can just roll attitude. i've got the big old moon again, and from where i sit, it looks like we're right on target. fifty miles above target, i'd like to add."
"17, houston. how do you read through aria?"
"(laughter) yeah, i think that one was longer. i'm looking at our dump nozzles out here. and there is very little buildup on the waste dump."
"okay, charlie. i've got the contingency check- list, and standing by."
- - we're hoping you've got four sample - four collection bags and an etb - - 07 00 01 b2 lmp-lm in the middle. 07 00 01 bb cc - - in the cabin with you now.
"charlie, let's go up here to this big blocky crater. man, that's really good."
"aquarius, houston. go ahead."
"okay, we're out of 18."
that's right.
"okay. you want to go - we'll go up on this ridge here, charlie, because that's where the big blocks were."
"i'm looking at the contrast chart in the sun, and i can see all the different shades. and i've taken a photo of it; now, look at the one in the shadow. in the shadow, i can see - well, depends on how close i am. if i'm within about 3 feet of it or _ feet of it, i can see all six shades. i'll take a picture here, then i'll back up."
"okay. you still with us, houston?"
"okay, ron. we're about 30 seconds from t - from lunar sounder standby time."
are we out of tape? lma°-lm be 8 hours on it. i don't think i left it on. i might have le_ it on. z probably did if i_'s on now. i thought i read it in the checklist though. don arabian will never forgive me.
open.
"okay, houston. several minutes ago i was exactly steady on data, and since then i have been moving (goss net 1) tape 50/8 toward the lm, pointed straight down toward the radius vector, and that's been despite a number of down minimum-pitch impulses."
"i was at zero signal strength, and i heard their transmission ... one of them. the first time they acknowledged that your - that i was going to do it."
"and a lot more fun, too."
okay.
"okay, houston. i just picked up this rock. it's a white rock, a very white rock, but it has a black glass layer on the back of it, or what appears to be black glass - a thick black glass; and it's about a hand-size specimen. i can't get it in the bag, but i'll get it anyway. and it has a lot of zap craters in it, and some - lining the zap craters are some white - whitish substance."
"no wonder we slipped, dave. boy, that's really soft dirt there around the - the front footpads."
"okay, and you're taking targets of opportunity."
"okay, a 58.0 in the range counter -"
okay ....
"roger, copy."
"that's what i thought, but i just saw a - oh, that was the code. oh, oh.... that 25 i saw ..."
"okay. we're going right through gimbal lock on the gdc, and :it'sgoing right by. imu's fine. okay. cmp is removing the - tunnel hatch. cmj_'s removing the probe now. okay. what was the delta-p, by the way, stu? i'll just jot it down here."
- - see that little pit right over there about 30 feet ahead.
"thank you, bob."
"okay, karl. tell you what, i'll give you a call back in about l0 minutes when i'm ready."
okay.
"okay; looks like fao owes us one, i had no trouble picking up index crater at all. the surface looks generally smooth. i saw no big boulders. i saw more craters than we're normally used to seeing, but i think that's because of the resolution of the photography. i can see a - a fair amount of boulders in the bottom of the rille. most of the surface seems to be pretty subdued and rounded. i did see some debris around some of the fresher craters. and, of course, i don't know exactly what size, but if we're looking at 3-feet reso- lution on this, i'd - i'd say i didn't see any- thing larger than - i guess, at the most, maybe 15 feet or so, but that's - that was a unique rock. the - the area, in general, looks pretty '_ good. i don't think we'll have any probtem pick- lng it up, and i don't think a1 will have any problem at all identifying index crater."
prior to the rest periods.
- - we're in the green on repress package.
"apollo 15, houston. over."
ail right. just wanted to ask ... did i say the middle of icarus looks like a big ... volcano? couldn 't.
primary.
"say again, buzz. over. 05 10 10 36 _ okay. i thrusted back - i thrusted back toward it a little bit, charlie, and i'm now reading noun 83, plus four balls 4, minus four balls 8, and you want me to kill average d. right?"
okay.
why don't you try the outside.
move your arm.
"gdc align; det, reset."
"ths_k you very much. and we're about to take our marks, charlie, on this p23 optics cal. i've got it in the sextant now, and i'm about to split the image and mark. o0 06 09 h2 cc roger, mike. we're watching."
okay. you want me - -
"it's broken. see, it's flipped off up there."
"fred, houston. we'd like to try going to average on the tv for a minute or so."
"well, that's what they said."
"yes, sir. and then we'll go on down about four lines to the ""set delta-v"" and that should read: ""set delta-v c minus 100."""
"eagle, houston."
"okay, jack. i was thinking switch. let me verify that's a circuit breaker, too. i think we have to get both of them."
"no, there's never been one there. the only place they've ever been - - 01 08 09 2? cmp let me have it."
the sun's shining right in my eyes. 05 15 i7 00 ia_p that's it.
"henry, another thing that turns out to be a - a pretty nice little gadget is these nets that are in the stowage comrartments. particularly when you get in the food locker when it's about half full. _nings are able to stay under some semblance of control. and that's a mighty nice thing."
"okay. at page 195, excuse me - time 195:15 - that's page 304."
"okay, we just got a beautiful picture of the earth from the - from the rover. just spectacular picture of the earth."
"- - and rear to d, and rear to d. drive power forward is going to a. i didn't feel any earth- shaking rumbles like i do in the - in the trainer, but let's see what happens."
okay. that's near the philippines.
"okay; we copy that, gene. and do you guys see any tracks coming down to these boulders? do have any feeling that these - you can place these thav way?"
_'oger. we were in down voice backup there and _hen command in normal.
maybe partially shocked.
"beautiful, davey. beautiful. and some more words - -"
roger. thank you.
okay.
"no, no. there's no way. not for short ranges like this."
okay. fine. (goss net l) tape 54/6
"columbia, this is houston. we request that you perform another p22. we'd like you t_ let the auto optics take care of the tracking and devote your energies to trying to pick out the lm on the lunar surface. if you can find the lm, of course. we're looking for marks on it; but track- ing of geographical features doesn't 2o us all that much good. over. 04 10 12 18 cm9 okay. fine. i'll do it. and on the ecs system, (colum3ia) the - whatever the problem was, it seems to have gone away without a[,ychanging of j52 sensors or anything like that. _ glycol evapor_ltor outlet temp is up above 50 now, and it's quite comfort- able in the cockpit; so we'll talk move about that one later. 04 10 12 _3 cc roger, columbia. did you shift into manual con- trol, or did the problem resolve itself under auto control? over."
"t_is is rev 3, is it not?"
"okay, very gosd."
"it was a cape problem on their tape, and they had it reversed. but it's in the noise level, anyway. no problem."
"okay. okay, john. turn the page."
roger. that's verified.
"you know that center window isn't too good for that. charlie, do you want to see if you get to take a pic - picture, or do you think it's worthwhile?"
"..., isn't she? it's a lot like ..."
"that out-of-plane was in the ags, not in the radar. (eagle)"
- - i wonder.
"i need that right there, old buddy."
"oh, pretty good. got our solar corona done, and we got a little 16-millimeter strip ... - un- fortunately, i missed the first couple of minutes wh_le i was changing mags, but you'll pretty close to a full rev. this has turned out to be a - i was looking through the flight plan to see a good rev: and it looked like this one has the hatch winmow pointing almost straight down; it's prob- ably the best rev we got going."
put that around here.
"... before, huh?"
roger. how do all our systems look?
okay.
it's just like a sim (laughter); 24 hours out instead of 2 ... - -
"okay, that did it, pete."
"okay, jack. lift-off time for rev 15 is 116:55:51; 16 is 118:54:28; 120:53:04; 122:51:40; 124:50:17; 126: 48:53. over."
"no, it's not going to be a pain at all, gordo; it's just impossible."
hey - the camera's working perfectly.
"apollo 13, houston through aria. just a comm check. over."
scs.
"fred, after the burn, we'i] get the powerdown instructions, or checklist changes to you. at the same time, we'd like to get a consumables status to you. ail i'll say right now is that we think you look in reasonably good shape."
"roger. standing by. 07 23 43 54 lm? okay, i'm ready to copy."
must be getting close.
"hey, one more thing for the tsb. i know, this ought to go in the waste disposal."
"yeah. is that cold enough, john?"
okay; logics coming on. logic 1. logic 2.
... dac's ... here.
"neil, this is houston. that's affirmative. we're getting a new plcture. you can r_ell it's a longer focal length lens. and for your infor- mation_ all lm systems are go. over. 04 13 51 _6 lm2 we appreciate that. 't/aankyou. 04 13 52 ]9 _ nell is now unveilsng the plaque *** gaar."
"well, don't mess with it then. don't mess your gloves up. i'll do it."
okay. you ready for pdi?
"okay, the dust is knocked off."
okay.
maybe you ought to wait until that no att light goes out.
sep light on at 3:06.
*** some blocks from the - -
okay. 750.
"c_ ahead, geno."
i'd like to dig into some of that chow ....
the 02 - -
we are going to try to improve the comm and telemetry by temporarily breaking lock and re- acquiring. you may hear some noise in your heads et.
okay.
"gee, i think so. might as well keep an eye on it, looks like we're getting ready to go in the dark here. could you wait until we get in the dark so i can look at you? right now, i've got the sun right smack in my eyes."
it's going to be enough to make geophysicists sit up and crow.
- from the northwest. can you get that?
"we had ours powered down completely for 2 days. when we brought it back up, the torquing angles were sometlling like - well, in coarse align, it doesn't - we put it - we parked it in gimbal lock. we didn't have any gyro drift updates or any pipa bias. that procedure really worked, john."
"vox, and that's vox. how do you read the lmp, gordy?"
what switch?
okay.
"the p52 will be done as an option 1. the only reason you have the other refsmmat inside tho computer is that in order to set the refsmmat flag, you need some r_lative orientation."
... point ...
okay.
but - anyhow. that's right.
"okay, here come the gimbal motors. ready, al, pitch 1."
"okay, we'll go over the cmp. meal a had bacon squared, scrambled eggs, orange juice, and coffee, vitamins; meal b - need some light (laughter) meal b is chicken and rice soup, meatballs with sauce, butterscotch pudding, orange drink, carmel candy, apricot cereal cubes, brownies - i guess that was it. meal charlie, potato soup, beef and gravy, the ambrosia peaches there - about half of it - four brownies, and an orange drink. okay, on the medical log: prd is 15047 and i had about 6-1/2 hours of sleep in, oh, catnaps i guess - some of them were a couple hours long. and had two sniffs of nose drops on each side prior to going to sleep and five cans of fluid. okav, for the con_nander's menu - how did we get to day l0 - it was only day 9 yesterday wasn't it?"
yes.
"mine's on, too."
"okay. look at his hands - look at his hands, joe. you figure he could take a picture? (laughter)"
"well, hello there. where in the hell did you come from?"
"just didn't want to screw with it later, pete."
that's what the meters say.
"gee, thanks a lot, jim."
roger. feet wet.
"a and b lights, off."
"charlie, can you hold my feet real good there? hold both of them. okay."
yeah.
that 's affirmative.
"that's correct, jack. that's just for additional security on the bag. when you get those done, you'll have - you'll have two strips going one way, and the other two will be perpendicular to them."
we'd like to pitch down to keep ken in sight. is that possible?
...
"16, houston. we're about a minute and a half to los. no further updates. everything looks good. canaries should have their antenna fixed, and we should be good as we go through their site. over."
"okay, al."
yes.
copy. 227/b.9.
okay. why don't you get me here before you do that?
"okay, we want you to open the secondary po_r _ps circui% breaker on panel il. and_ of course, you _- lose e,3_m when yo_- 9pen =_'._; ar_d _hax 3,f-,-__ __l- uve; close i%, _nd then .¢e:ll re_stali:_ah ,_om:_"
"yes, look at it. good."
i got it.
"_nese guys can call it what they like, but i know what it's going to be and when."
"(cough). okay. your electrical and 02 are con- nected, right-hand blue and locked."
i don't think so - wait - where are the torquing angles ...?
"okay, houston, the battery temperature is reading 100 degrees f, which it was reading before - that's the one the other one always reads."
"roger. minus 0 - okay, wait a minute. okay, it's plus 060. excuse me."
"thank you very mucl, owen. i think my yard could use some water."
"yes, about like the first night."
"flag p; press flag, 0; 02 .... and tones."
"how about switching headsets with one of you guys, huh?"
...
*** tell me what they're trying to get with it. i might be able to help them.
"okay, that'll be good. and then by the time i get there - -"
roger.
"okay, we're moving at l0 clicks; we're at 347 on bearing and 3.9 on the range."
okay; your p24 is next.
okay.
"you're now 1500 miles above the surface_ and your climb rate was just computed at 295 000 feet per minute. cy_p ... (chuckle) that is really moving out. _p sare glad they cleared %he traffic ou_ of the way. let me - gene_ let me switch over briefly and snow zhem the north and south poles, which nobody really has done much with yet_ except for lunar orbiter, and some of the russian vehicles. there's a spec- tacuiar valley off - on the south pole. i don'v know tne n_me. iv looks like one of t_lese long chain of - - chain of craters."
"that's affirmative. everything on, exsep% alfa 1 and alfa 2 - -"
"there's no way they can tell what it is on these short things; they don't have any idea where we are, char - ken."
"why don't we just leave it there until i get a chance to take it down and play with it, because i have a place for it ... in. 00 01 19 3c lmp okay."
i was sure proud to hear that big bang.
- - on the floor of the valley here.
- - let's go through it then.
okay. we just clicked to 4. i want to move over this way just a s_2_osh_
roger.
"oh, that's - that's nice. that's been there for a while."
my docking budget didn't allow for all this. but i get no prize if i break it.
"yes, sir."
"this second s-band thing won't deploy. 04 19 56 11 lm2_ well, do you want me to pull or hold?"
(laughter)
yes. document some of that. here's a rock right here.
"roger. that's what i meant. thc, clockwise."
and there is no question when you get the latches.
"okay. we've got three obliques. the last one is one i asked for recently. it's just a blow-up of the second one. the first one is one that's got dotted lines on it, indicating horizon view and 50-degree lpd; and all three of those are in the transfer book. over."
do you want the t-ephem first?
"- - aux switch to science, please."
"no, i think it's just you. people are always giving you static."
roger. just a reminder on that. and eecom is over here trying to figure out if you changed the canister or not. just a reminder on that one.
never mind.
"13, houston. you might stop the f-stop down one more notch, if you got any left."
we started it.
"yes, i got it. hey, bob. i got my rock. it's halfway between the sep and the lm. wait, wait. let me put it in the big bag - in the big bag."
i wonder what crater that is?
"houston, america. ?"
"pro. engine arm. descent engine command override. 0kay, 413."
"well, doesn't look like i got anything that time."
"there, we just - we just got a wiggle on - yes - -"
"okay, karl. go ahead."
"and, if you're looking at anything and you can see anything interesting, we wouldn't mind hearing about it."
okay.
"readback's correct, jim; thank you. apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription"
"okay, joe. that chip off the old boulder there was 275. why don't you get this one. and i'll get - oh, man - seven bags. let me get a bag off of you there."
our burn's complete. our burn's complete.
okay.
i think we can get a pretty good distribution.
"okay, jack, you got it."
"okay. eecom is looking at that battery amperage that you gave us awhile ago. he'd like to see it about a half an amp to an amp lower. like you to ask jack to just check the circuit breakers and switches that he's pulled in so far and make sure he doesn't have any extra loads on main a; specifically, the floodlight configuration, and his caution and warning circuit breakers, and his essential instrumentation power circuit breakers. over."
(laughter)
for that camera and stuff. you've got to start taking pictures. 00 02 06 07 cml° okay.
okay. how are you doing tonight?
okay. all i said was jim doesn't have his biomed rigged right now so i'll go back to down voice backup spa and jim's coming on the line.
"well, let's dump- -"
"oh, good. i was waiting for you to pass me."
"when am i going to eat? 03 08 5_ 48 lmp ... 03 08 58 49 cml° no, go ahead and finish your - -"
stand by.
"sounds good. 06 04 59 44 cdr-i_m houston, challenger. the 02 is complete on - 02 fill is complete on the lmps plss, and we're work- ing on the water."
"orb rate_ inertial. okay, now what do you want to do?"
"it'd never do for us to leave that one behind, bruce."
none of that.
"man, it's really tempting though. it really looks nice out there."
yeah. 0ay9 page373 08 08 31 39 _ beautiful.
it really is. the ground - msfn says all solutions are converging.
"okay, we'll do that, joe. stand by. that ought to be good."
"oh, really? thank you."
"well, ken's state vector is the same as ours, charlie."
no sooner said than done.
"okay, and here's one b_mmer for you."
okay.
doesn)t that make you nervous?
"boy, you're looking right into nansen. lmp-e_'a yes. we're right where we wanted to be for sta- tion 2. it looks like a great place. big blocks. it looks like quite a bit of variety from here. different colors, anyway. grays and lighter colored tans."
"apollo 15, go."
"jim, while we're waiting to see if they have any more questions, i'd like to read you the booster people's preliminary analysis on the - the s-ii cut-off. over."
"that's ron. got his vhf on, that fink. hey, you might tell ron we can hear him."
"yes, i can see the tv is pointed right at the com- mand module there. right at the interface."
"okay, l0 seconds, john. 08 o0 29 39 cmp/lmp 5, 4, 3, 2, i -"
"roger. in other words, the loose - the hook is loose so it flops a little bit_ you can move it, back and forth. is that affirm?"
"okay, houston; here comes your e-mod dump."
...
loud and clear: loud and clear.
"let's see, you still have some sample bags on your camera, don't you?"
"oh, shit. 06 02 54 18 i_p pete, don't let me forget when we go out to get this other stuff that we've got over here, pete. we got the ppks back ...."
"okay, and since we are going to get rendezvoused in the dark - i guess we'll just come up alongside and hold stations."
okay; 300 on the lunar.
okay.
both of them okay.
"that's funny, because i don't hear tha_."
"okay, gene. you going to go to the rover and change your mags now?"
"and we could use a pan from this lower location also, probably. roger. that sounds good to us."
"15, houston. the computer's yours."
"here, let me get the - -"
"we copy that, 14. you're looking real good."
there's nothing there.
roger. we'd like to get both of you in the field of view of the camera for a minute.
"16, this is - houston. will you give us another reading on that docking tunnel index when you have an opportunity?"
okay. i'm gonna have to hit a command reset. is that all right with super tech - comm?
"oki. let's see, we'll give it to the pus - 30 seconds on the mode select, ri_t?"
straight down?
okay.
"i think i'll go and save some water, back on intermediate. okay."
you got it? _
yeah.
mmm!
"okay. no update then, huh?"
photograph that ...
apollo 11. ready to copy.
roger.
"man, that docking target is bright."
tvc servo power's off.
...
"if it jumps, it's going - -"
... you're breaking up.
"ham_.er to left seat. l_,_ ur_load - okay, we're both unloaded. pack the etb. wait a minute. i should be doing it. 06 05 34 21 l_p-eva i've got it in my checklist, too. that's something. ]6 05 3l 29 cdr-eva okay, now you're going to have to - going to have to change that some because we got a li_t!e more than two htc back. 06 05 3x 41 lmp-eva john, could you get those _oodies in the left seat bag there in my b_g '_t_dpass them over? 06 05 3h 49 cdr-eva okay."
"america, houston. this is for ron. it looks like one of your sensors may have come loose, so we're getting bad data. and don't interrupt your eating, but when you get a chance you might try and push them on or service them or whatever needs to be done."
"did you ever get the picture of the _ and earth? 05 15 t0 25 _p no. 05 15 10 4_ cdr oh, that's a shame."
"okay. right after ""tvc servo power, i and 2, off,"" we want to enter a little comment that says, ""prior to trimming noun 85, noun 20 should be checked against the imu."""
"hey, yours just cleared, very minor. didn't mine clear?"
"okay. i2{p-eva by the way, bob, the soil gets more cohesive with depth. i hadn't really noticed that before."
"okay. 05 (13 54 03 cm__ i just got a good view of the southern (]ross, alpha and beta centaur], and atria."
"okay. when you're ready, we'd like to go on with - -"
"hey, bob. may be a little premature - but i don't think so - but i think there was some good thinking into that update, looking at the flight plan up until now and where we go from here. i don't think we - we overlooked a thing."
"okay, your delta-v c is set correctly on 159.4."
"make that yaw 175, columbia, yaw 175 on the high gain."
... rubber to the valve in there.
"okay. camera, tongs, and i'll drive. west leg, heading 270."
"}louston, aquarius."
yes; that's correct.
"ah, i think it's ... there."
"okay, ed. i got - i got a ..."
"okay, houston; america, ready to copy. pad's here, and you have accept."
"okay. the cross tie balance load circuit breakers is in now, vance. now you want us to put bat- tery 2 back on. is that affirm?"
"yes. we could do that. we were actually pretty interested in seeing what the effect on i""['c would be of the waste-water dump. we don't re- call ever having performed a waste-water d_np during ptc on previous missions. over."
mass spec discriminator to low.
engine arm to descent.
"okay. what do we need out to talk about - or with, maps or anything?"
"it's locked on there, isn't it?"
got it right out my window.
can't read them either.
got to roll over so john can get to my ... valve.
"twenty-one, you - -"
and we're going at - at about l0 clicks; amps reads about 10.
we want to get a - i got the high pan.
"no, if you're where you think you are, you're beyond - you're east of rudolph quite a ways."
"okay. will do. 04 11 13 3h cmp okay, jack. this pass, the earth came into view at the top left-hand corner of the lmp's window and was going down. however, when it passed it wasn't as high up as the last pass. it did pass into view at the cdr window, but too high up to get an lpd reading. 01411 13 57 cc roger. understand it went high in both windows then. 014]] 14 04 cmp yes, last time it wasn't even visible in the cdr's window; this time it was visib]e if you squatted down, but too high up to _et an lpd reading. 04 1] ill i1_ cc ()kay, jack. that's _ood. thank you. _/]$ ii _1 51 ('.mp [.)kay, houston; aquar:ius. 04 i] ?1 53 cc go ahead. over. oh 11 ?l q7 limp okay. the moon came into view at the mlddi!e __' t:helmp's window, passed through the cd]_'s window at an lpd of 5 degrees. 014il _,_']_1 cc roger. understand. 0)l11 35 55 cmp houston, aquarius. 04 [1 35 58 cc go ahead, aquarius."
"see that? let's try it. 03 23 52 43 t2_p ()kay, doing a verb 96."
that's probably ...
"yes, i can feel that, too."
what thing?
six percent. there's good dust. on your own at - ...
"oh, we're getting so we all sound alike up here."
got my tones.
okay.
"america, houston."
"houston, do you read? gene, do you read me?"
i put up my antenna so i can read you a little better.
"need the - dark slide. here. okay. w-f_ere's oscar oscar? whoops. vhbw. there's a - 08 21 24 24 imp we've got a good oblique view of the hortensius domes, and with their nice little central pit craters."
"that's a great picture, jim. you got the light just right. 02 07 16 40 _ and one of the nice things, jack, particularly for a novice like myself, is the - the ease of moving around in here. it's, of course, as you know from working in the command module simulator, it's really quite a boon to have zero gravity as an aid. because you get - pretty confining, really, at one g, to move around very much in there, and it's quite easy in this environment. the lm, as you can see, it looked pretty clean, i found a couple of loose washers about it and the - a little plastic cap off the sequence camera had come loose and i found it lodged over by the ed panel. okay. right under jim, now, he's actually standing on a - what looks to be a can here. and, for the sake of all the people back there, housed inside this can is the - the lm ascent engine where, hopefully, you can see my hand resting on top of right now - the engine that we use to get off of the moon. immediately adjacent to the engine cover here, i have my hand on a white box now, which has been shown before. this happens to be jim's plss, or the backpack which'll supply oxygen and water for cooling while on the lunar surface. this device we hope to make use of for - a planned 4 hours and possibly up to as much as 5 hours. right - right behind the plss, a couple of little square pack- ages i now have my hand on here, one here and one right below, are our opss, which are, in essence, the emergency oxygen supplies, which are good for some 40 to 45 minutes. these are - when we get ready to mount up and head outside, will be placed up on top of the plss."
i'll tell you this 1/6 gravity feels a lot better.
"... for a minute there, they were all ..."
go ahead.
what time were they on?
yes.
...?
... started.
he's holding attitude. it'll give us a new maneuver here.
no. will that bother you getting in?
we do have some attitude changes - -
"i guess i'd have to say - sort of, two events occurred which were exciting for different reasons, and i guess they were really kind of the highlights of - of the flight for me. one was, right after loi, when we got our first look at the moon, and it was a fantastic, spectacular sight. and the other, i guess, was when tgi burned so beautifully, and right after tei, that was an awfully good feeling."
"we're c_ning up over africa now, gordon, and it really is a spectacular view."
okay.
"okay. i just ran out of film at 160. and i'm about two pictures short of the pan, and they're upslope. i think i can cover most of that with the 500."

okay.
okay. you're a little - -
"roger; in work. 05 22 45 53 l_p-eva joe, i'm going to take bag number 3 off the back of the pallet. put number 6 there, so we can keep the numbers straight."

"okay. how's your ags doing ower there? 05 22 35 23 ij_{p mar_, _ney're just staying right in there. just hanging in pretty as can be."
"i'm afraid that - that on the specific kind of questions you asked, in this case, i'm - i'm really kind of out to lunch. i - i can't make specific things when you sayhow large. there - the length of these things that i can trace are the same size as - as the crater that i was _-_ looking at. and i guess that must not be that central one, but one of the adjacent ones - one of the ones on the north. but they're - they're quite long, and they're all over the area. they're in craters; they're outside of them; they're on the floors. you see these things just about everywhere you look back there. they're large, and they're just - it sort of defies my imagination. i see nothing that looks like sources anywhere."
"17, houston. we're with you again, and you're looking good."
that's affirmative. and s you'll need your logic powers to get that in.

"okay. we show you should have gotten in the trench site sample, the core tube samples from the end - from the bottom, and also the gas analysis sample."
"i tell you - yeah. and it's just about that big, too, from where we're looking. it just - just fills the window just about like that."
"and we're going to proceed on this one, too, charlie."

"yes, let me get it for them. okay. we're at 227/b.9."

"okay. now these are the back room's best guess. that spook sampling may be compromised by that ray from south ray that you described, and since we're mostly interested in local cayley on eva-i, you'll probably have to spend a little time trying to differentiate between secondaries coming in from south ray and local material. you described most of the ray material as being very angular. one of the clues may be rounded blocks, for local material. at flag, again, you may have that same problem, since we couldn't see over there, we really couldn't tell, and we don't want you to feel bound to plum crater there at flag; if there's another place on the rim of flag where you're more likely to get local material, feel free to head for it."
"yes, right in the wall of the crater."
"forward omni, charlie."
"yes, it sure is. that's been a very - help."
"challenger, this is houston."
"hate to say this, because it's very dead serious work, but i'm kind of watching a lunar comedy as the - the two lunar stalwarts are trying to plan the new fender on the vehicle down there. cml° (laughter) i'll bet that's really no easy job, you know."

i guess it went to pd0 faster than it showed uz down there or went into p30 not through it.
"we'll believe the strip chart. we'll take the strip chart data. we've got 01:24, i minute 24 seconds for extend and 01:51, i minute 51 sec- onds for retract. and both those are a little bit on the high side."

"no, i can't, hank. it's - it's - unkey your mike a second. let me tell you what it sounds like. it - it sounds like that we've got the other loop - the other air-to-ground or the flight director's loop or something like that that's got a vox key that comes on, and i don't hear it when you make a short statement. but when you're on for - and hold it down for any length of time, then all this other talking comes on, and it sounds like i can probably hear tony and i'm not sure who all else. nothing is very clear. it is exceptionally noisy, and it just sounds like - sounds like trying to hold a conversation in a football game - is what it sounds like. and it's been - it's been annoying, but now it's getting to the place where i can't even read you."

"okay, mighty fine. send it up."
"and thanks to good old stu roosa's suggestion, we wrote in the flight plan to be sure and take a look at the fires out there in africa as we went over, which is something we probably would have forgotten or never even thought about. and they are just as beautiful as everybody's ever said they could be. they're just all over the place. ail these little - little yellowish-red dots down there. and there was some - looked like some low overcast in parts of the area, or maybe it was - from our altitude, maybe it was a high overcast. but it just gave - it looked like looking at the lights of a city through fog, and then there were others that were clear. just something well worth remembering to look for."

why is that coming up? why didn't it come down?

"no, it goes right throug_ dead center of picard."

"okay. that sounds like a good observation. 06 09 55 49 cml° look at alphonsus. i'm looking at the eastern or the dark gray craters, the one that's almost due east of the central peak, the largest ring deposit there. and to the _muaided eye, it stands out quite dramatically. when i put the binoculars on it, _he difference is extremely subtle. you really have to look for it, and then it just turns out to be a slightly different color, but i can't say anything at all about any difference in textures or any other thing that's different except that there's a slightly different color to it. but it's more obvious to the unaided eye than it is to the eye with magnification."
"count is 55 now on romeo romeo, houston. _o, not until _e come up to tobias, just before tobias mayer."

"yes, but the rake's next, as you might imagine. geno, now this - this looks - this stuff here looks a little less vesicular. why don't we try that one?"
"america, houston."
and we're with all eyes here waiting for a crisium-serenitatis visual.
roger. understand.
i don't think it's off.
"roger. understand. it's got you glued to the win- dews, i guess, huh?"
"well, you might sound all the good words from us."
say again. we need auto.
"copy minus 4 balls 6, minus 3 balls 17, minus 3 balls 17, torqued at 17006."
yeah.
...
"right. it's 2 minutes 40 seconds, but it's going to be out of your visual range, somewhere around the center area of the moon."
roger. 39.2 on the volts; 1.4 on the amps.
"oh, his flashlight goes in his suit."
"aquarius, houston."
"okay. i'm drinking, and - water open. okay. want a drink of water?"
"3kay, good. c3 16 19 3h cmp {kay, configuc_e camera shutter: i/20oths; range is on the _ad, 51.7; intervalometer is 65. going to bang them off one _ second."
"there's one thing that's pretty obvious, as we're setting out the components of the alsep here, is i just hope that these thermal coatings don't have to stay as white as they are right now, be- cause there's just no way. with all this dust, there's just no possibility that - -"
that's what we're looking for.
okay.
"""uv cover closed,"" 180:44. ·"
i don't under - i - i -
that's correct.
"al, watch your tv cable."
i'll tell you - we all had a good time doing it.
"that's the fourth, jack. better do that."
"well, let me think for a minute, now. they were all within the crater itself. none of them were outside of the crater. the - the last ones i took at - started taking marks at - beyond what the really time was, just because you could still see it. so i wouldn't put too much faith in those - in about the last four."
there it is. bet you.
okay; 3400. i confirm.
"okay, houston- -"
"you don't think there is any chance of us pulling it all the way out, dave?"
"and, dave, while you're taking that picture, we'll _- be asking for a core tube after that. we want you to use an upper core, because we only have one lower in the bag right now."
"okay, the fmc's working. fra_.e counter went up orle ."
okay. i guess we're ready to head on out. do you agree?
okay. that 's better.
yes.
"and on the exposures we're looking for an eighth of a second,, a half a second. and, if you think you can steady the camera against anything to get longer exposures, 2 seconds, 4 seconds, and 8 sec- onds. over. 02 23 37 11 _ roger. we copy. kgo!;sl_gt l) tape 46/5"
"okay, jim. coming up on 6 minutes. 03 10 33 27 _ okay. '03 10 33 28 cdr start. 03 10 33 29 _ main bus ties coming on."
"roger; copy, al. we'll call you at 275 hours to repeat that. the reason for that is that pres- ently we're sort of sitting in a cold-soak attitude. we're going to repeat it at 275 hours when we're sort of in a hot-soak attitude. 11 08 5u 43 cmp okay. r',"
"release. we didn't go very far. (laughter) okay. we'll let it sit here for a second. okay, we're going to back off, now."
shit.
and we are on the terrace. and there is a terrace.
on this side over here?
okay. we're going to check it out; thank you.
"yeah, and my attitude hold looks a lot like that too."
ail right. that's correct. on page 2-2. 05 07 54 06 cml° go ahead.
"okay, the next item is at i - stand by on that a minute. and at 175: 54, delete the laser altimeter, off. _ 07 06 05 37 cmp understand. at 175:58 [sic], delete laser altimeter, off."
"how much did you see, pete?"
"okay. we got that. 0_ 22 06 34 cmp that one's ... some of them are even getting bigger. one of them is - oh, about three-quarters of an iach in diameter, and it hasn't divided yet, at all."
outstanding.
supposed to do that?
"go ahead, joe."
did you punch grav a second time? that's identical to the first one.
okay; we'd like you to use pitch at minus 50 and yaw 320 and acquire the high gain.
"okay, coming up on 2 minutes, ken. 09 03 30 14 cml° okay."
that looks good.
"yeah, this is a super place right here for this up-sun one. okay, here we go with a big drill coming up. down into the crater he goes. there's a secondary. little one. *** like the big eye is looking at something else."
"okay, 11. i've got a few small items here: one flight plan update and some entry photography information, if you are ready to copy. over."
"and 16, i'm still sitting here with about 6 items, a couple of which require readings. most of them just require a little talking. anytime you can get to it - well, let's get started on it. '_ tape 16b/b"
we'll stop about halfway down here and do another rake. how's that?
okay. not - no rush.
why don't you go up a click and let us have a look at that.
"that's r_ght. 01 03 38 11 _p houston, 16. do you guys feel like that your transducers are good on the ground? 01 03 38 26 _ what i mean to say is, do you feel like that your telemetry's good on the sps tank pressure?"
"did :you get that mark, houston, on the integrity cheek ?"
push cabin.
"that's affirmative. okay. and, hank, would you run over my rcs select procedures again? i'm not sure i got the right combination for you."
"when i get up there, joe, i'll give you the readings."
"you're right, and belay my last. i don't guess we'll have that large antenna."
"hey, ron. did you have some noise in the cockpit just now?"
and you'll be happy to know we completed the skylab food evaluation with very few casualties.
we've only got 12 minutes to the burn.
"okay, fred. thank you."
okay.
"challenger, houston. on your comm, your checklist will call for going to down-voice backup. and, tonight, we'd rather just leave it in the normal voice. so if you leave the configuration you have, rather than change it_ - that would be a good deal for us."
"under item 4, we want to change from ""20 seconds - 2 frames"" to ""2 seconds - 2 frames."""
"pete, that glass brush should be over there on the handtool carrier if that will be of use to you. 05 ih 58 25 cdr we're using it right now. works good, too. that's it. okay, al. put that back in. c5 14 58 32 _ back in."
"go ahead, america. this is houston. c_ okay, bob, i don't have a map with south _,_ssif on it. you know with the meridian interval on the thing and it looks like the only thing i can use is in the visual observations book here - landing site 204. and, if you draw a iine - do you have that one? 0c okay, i've landing site 204 in front of me. chp okay. if you draw a line from shorty to that reseau mark that's on the top of the south massif -"
"i know. i'd - i'd like to be able to plan a listle further ahead. if you don't get ahead - plain ahead, you just run a real good chance of nos getting all the things done the way you'd like to. 08 01 24 _5 cc we agree. and i'll try to hav_ some words for you here in a few minutes."
"yes, i wouldn't ..."
roger. we have you back at the lm.
i wonder if i ought to go ahead and put - take some descent batteries - -
"- - ice chunks, possibly. or maybe there's paint coming off of it."
i don't think it'll be big enough for the ears.
(yawn)
"and don't - don't forget on that activation cheek- list that one of them has that ecs stuff, and the other's got - make sure we have both of those. yes."
yeah.
"okay, 17, for the last 2 hours, we've been getting high-bit-rate data from a new facility, the facility at tidbinbilla and they're working their first apollo flight ever, you might give them a cheery hellow."
"okay, houston. we're coming up on 2 hours here. how about the logic sequence check?"
"you know, jim, i got a checklist on the left arm for one thing that's going on now, and a check- list on the right arm for something else that's going on now (laughter)."
"and, the shadow is - it's 4 degrees left."
"and if i could ever get ron out of the kitchen, we'd get into ptc."
"okay; thank you, hank."
"okay, houston. ready to get ... arm, on."
(music: anchors aweigh)
"that is going to be a bright bear out there, isn't it?"
roger.
"yes, sir."
"yes, we don't think you're anywhere near cochise."
roger.
"okay, i was going to try to recover there from that last few statements. as i recall, the weather briefings that we had at the cape last week, that - talking with ken nabor and jim nicholson do_n there, that the patterns we were seeing from the satellite pictures in their forecast - or analysis anyway, charts in the new zealand part of the pacific, those waves formed along the front would move north and then curve east. and that appears to be the pattern that was visible in one of the older fronts. and i suspect if that pattern would hold with the wave that's developed off the coast - right on the coast of new zealand now, that it might move on up the western coast of new zealand. we'll probably have a chance to watch that the next few days and see what happens to it."
take it away. 05 1512 58 cdr okay. and the game is don't rush and do it right.
okay. that sotmds good.
"okay, we copy that. stand by 1."
"okay. i'm 3.75; reading 20 percent; and no flags; minimu74 cooling, and feel great."
"hey, stop 1 second. watch out. don't - don't come across - don't - i know. that's what i want you to do is come take it."
"well, i don't know how long that rock's been there, but that dirt has been shadowed ever since it's been there."
"and, let's see, i don't see the fountain pen. okay. you got the algorithm?"
you said it. one -
"..,_,;ye_h_, ..... oay i _[. page 85 o0 02 bo 35 lmp okay, and that's on your card over there."
a what?
"okay, the next one's coming around this way."
45.9. that sounds a lot better. okay.
mark. got it? you got the time?
"roger, 15. we copy."
"tell them, hell!"
you're at 4.7.
rcs helium i and 2 - -
there. 05 14 04 52 imp okay.
"i found it right down in - fred, in this stowage -"
"well, he said go get the bedrock, and i think we - ought to try and get it if we can. because this sure looks like a bedrock to me. i looked at the rille and down the rille to the south, and it's just a - one great big massive layer of the same kind of fragmental debris on the order of meters. quite well-rounded."
"okay, key v - null the needles. key verb when hulled. freeze display. and then - -"
"houston, 17."
how about your pliers?
"okay, ken, i think we ought to go back to the voice ranging on the vhf. is that what your pdi switch list called for?"
"i guess we have to agree that the cable doesn't reach all the way over to 227, and the request down here is that you voice-record shutter opening and closing on the s - on the dse."
"yes, it is. *** get much data that way. even if it's hot. *** worried about getting it so hot it -- ' cc it's automatic. it turns itself off when it gets above 108, so it's not good anyway."
got the pad over with you? because i don't see it over here with me.
stand by. it looks on the map - -
"i don't have any sensors on, gordy."
"come towards me, baby. looks like it's moving."
"go ahead, ll. (goss net 1) tape 20/4 01 06 51 18 cml° oh, charlie. that you?"
"okay. turn around, jack. hey, bob, we'll use 8 instead of 4."
no - - 06 18 54 26 i_mp - - can't figure out it ever did anything else.
"okay. 0nly thing we don't have in the etb that i see is the - is the cre, and that's going in right now."
"okay. the next thing is to turn your plss 02 on, anyway."
it's going up.
roger. did yankee clipper have us both in his sextant at the same time? over.
and can i turn my transponder off?
"well, i'll tell you what i've got. i've got the consumables curves, and if there are any major changes to those curves, i guess you could give them to me, and i'll put them on as points."
"america, houston. one other request you might be thinking about that you'd - and that is any delta to the nominal entry stowage that we might not know about we'd like to know about before you go to sleep tonight so we can think about the c.g."
"that's affirmative, jim, with the following deltas on step 3, and if you'll turn to page 26, t'i] give ynl_ the delta.q on the activation cir- cuit breaker list. over."
you're going to have to reckon with him yet on those ...
"okay, houston. we're ready to proceed with the logic."
and i'm off the peg.
"mode control, both, off."
okay .... 6.... line-of-sight radar ... what it is. line-of-sight ....
"enter, plus 22 - okay, noun 78's, verb 24, noun ... enter."
with the lm in the foreground?
ullage.
"it won't hack bi, charlie, with the cover. i tried it already."
good morning.
he doesn't read. he - -
got it?
"now, what do you want?"
back up against the circuit breakers.
"it's just easier on the eyes. you just can't see any more, that's all. you don't have that static, huh? /"
go ahead.
"we're getting some of that, ron. sounds like the mike might have slipped away from your mouth, though."
wait until i turn around. just a minute.
"so far, i haven't seen any pits - pits on any of these. and, most of them are about 1/5th buried. okay, here's another one that's got - oh, on - on the underneath side of that - i hope i don't lose these tongs - on the underneath side of this frag, joe, i can see some soil that is caked on the bot- tom, about i millimeter thick, and maybe down in the place from which i got it, we could sample. why don't we get it - i'll take a picture and you can scoop that. and there's another one that has a large - -"
"hey, ken, why don't you summarize what you did in the way of thrusters to tell them what to expect. okay?"
"16, houston. i have your map and pan camera photo pads for 80:35 whenever you're ready."
okay. (eagle )
"copy that. 06 17 48 b9 i2_p-eva okay, bob, looking up at the north massif, we see the scattered, strewn field of boulders, that generally seem to start from a - more or less, from a line of large boulders, which might in- dicate some structure. and those lines are roughly horizontal across the face that we're looking at. the boulder tracks are irregular in shape, obvi- ously downhill, but you'll see in the pictures that they - that they are curved in places but they're all - that i see - tend to be aggregates of little craters - where the boulder was ob- viously tumbling and bouncing a little bit. we're out in population of fragments now in the immedi- ate area at i - is that 1887"

"okay, starti - starting on the deep drill."
what's that?
better make sure it's lunar ... %

"okay, ken. if you can kill that line of sight, you're closing."
"that was great. hey, let's go by that - see that big rock over there? maybe that's a permanently shadowed one. try it?"
"ron, we're 5 minutes from los here. everything's looking great. just - you have to finish off your checklist on that tm, p20 and cmc mode back to auto. and then just a reminder on that loh [sic] canister: if you'd go back and pick that up, we'd appreciate it. cml° okay, we'll get that one. i'm going to try and see if i can find saturn here."

"negative. according to the map i've got, it's - the ross sea looks like it would be more facing up towards the south america area. it's actually kind of facing up sort of the middle between australia and south america, jack."
"yes, whoa."
"15, this is houston."
"okay, ken, we read 25 miles."
you feel okay?
"ron, if you've got 1/2 scale on your high gain, will you go to reacq and narrow?"

"13, houston. we'd like you to verify couple of readings for us. we would like the nitrogen pressure on fuel cell 1. we need the oxygen pressure on fuel cell 2."
"uh-oh, the top popped open."
"roger, pete. we copy."
... on the angle ... a good shape.
"in fact, the only one."
it's a quiet morning.
do you read charlie?
"okay, houston. do you want to copy? okay, houston. on the commander's menu, we use negative reporting. okay, did not eat potato soup, chicken stew, and peach ambrosia. i'm sorry, i started with meal c instead of a. _d then to add on meal charlie, three-fourths jelly candy. okay, we'll start with a again, on the commander. did not eat peaches and cocoa. meal bravo, did not eat chicken and rice soup and fruitcake. add one-fourth jelly candy. okay, for breakfast on day 14. did not eat mixed fruit. did not eat cinnamon toast and bread. did not eat coffee. and add one can of peaches. okay, commander's medical log: prd, 17065; 5 hours, fair; none; and five cans of water. okay, for the lmp, start with meal a, day 13. did not eat bacon squares, apricots, cocoa. meal bravo, did not eat chicken and rice soup. and add - add on graham cracker cubes and a plain coffee. meal 13, did not eat chicken stew, peach ambrosia, grapefruit drink, and add on a plain coffee and sugar cookies. day - day 14, meal a, did not eat a half a sausage and a mixed fruit and scratch the potassium in the coffee - a plain coffee. okay, lmps prd, 24227; 6 hours of good; none; and three cans of water. okay, cmp, meal a, day 13: did not eat four bacon squares, apricots, and add on a car - a carmel candy. meal bravo, did not eat one-fourth of the fruitcake. add on two tea, three-fourths jelly candy and graham cracker cubes. meal charlie, did not eat chicken stew. add on one-fourth jelly candy. for breakfast, did not eat mixed fruit. scratch the with k in the coffee. drank the coffee, but it was black. add on peaches. okay, cmps medical: prd, 15062; 7 hours of good. the rest of the guys said it was noisy, but i thought it was good. let's see - medication: one decon- gestant, one seconal; and three cans of water. and that completes the medical/food readback."
you can't do anything more than that.
"okay. thank you. read the card there. well, i think we're going to pump the cabin up with it, charlie. just read the - yep."
okay.
do what?
"okay; the third row, we wasst the ""a transmitter and b receiver, close."" ye're going to get some ¥qff ranging. 07 23 34 0,3 i2._ okay."

very interesting. which window are you looking out?
okay. stand by 1.
roger on that.
cabin repress coming open. open.
"okay, don. is that any better?"
they all look different to me when i go hanging upside down.
"roger. i'd say he was dividing everything by 10. and, dave, be advised the program - -"
"it moved - oh, about came out some. okay."
...
copy 3.5.
"okay, joe. the lm/cm delta-p is a plus .7."
and--

"okay, what's the heading down survey ridge, where i think we are right now, charlie?"
okay.
not without moving.
"roger, joe. understand at 201:17:00, mapping camera, image motion, increase to barber pole; at 201:28:21, el on; at 201:30:01, el off; 201:32:00, off. no, back to 30:01, after el off, read map camera, off; laser, off. and, at 201: 32:o0, retract and close the mapping camera covers."
that should do her. i think we've fixed it. i had the hoses in n_ storage box.

"hank, another piece of questionable data _ha_'ve collected today is - well, on our low pass c× the back side there, we got our color wheel out. and we have two votes for number 17, and one vo_e for number 13."
"no, he's got some questions on the sim bay."
roger. the bias test is completed at _he end of a minute 40 seconds. we got 102.0 on our delta-v co_mter.

"roger. we've been reading you. i think you're on vhf, however. would you like us to reacquire on the high gain?"
"it's a new world in this command module, with all these extra box - boxes and everything."
when you fall out - you fall out on your other al_. l_p-eva i've got - there is some on that leg there.
"roger. if one of you fellows has the time, we might like to continue on with the mass spec boom retract test."
"just to be conservative, ken. l0 01 24 17 cnp okay', that's just - all right."
you're pretty garbled.
"okay. that's fine, charlie. thank you. apollo 16 air-to-ground voice transcription"
let's take this one right here.

that's affirmative. we didn't get much of the kwajalein report.
roger. we got that.
"yes, sir."
"hello, there."
... we got jett bag in 3 - 310b ... turn around and look ...
"houston, do you read forward omni any better? over."
"gordo, i'll maneuver in about 10 minutes."
"we copy, 15."
"510, bob."

"okay, you got it. onfi '"
there's a lunar rock to show them.
"sure do apologize, houston, for the overburn. i got my head looking at a1 there, and i just shut her off late."
"and when you get that, just might as well do your exercise ' don't want to interfere with that. arid i'll just give you a brief call prior to los."
okay.
what are they from? 00 02 o0 07 cml° nomads.

"yes, that's what we are saying, ken. we're just afraid we might be cutting it kind of tight on the up-link."
"*** you're looking right at it, but it's only l0 meters away. you're looking right at the flag."
"while we're still outside the dead band, that's not going to work unless i cycle it free and back to recenter the dead band. you folks want to watch it outside the dead band for a while?"
go ahead.
"intrepid , houston."

houston - ken. over.

yes. i keep forgetting these checklists have been exercised a hundred thousand times.
we want the dap load after you get to attitude and then the other dap load before you start the next maneuver. f
we've got plenty. 74.
roger.
but you can see a lot better over here when you take your shades off.

"we'd like another confirmation, when we closed the tunnel vent valve back to lm/cm delta-p, we were reading about 1.7 - 1.75, and it slowly went up now to about - oh, i'd say a little less than 2.2. seems to be holding there - is there a lag in the gaging system?"

"thank you. sort of get this thing memorized after - on the third time, tony."
right. you're gonna be docking with - you're just slowly drifting to the north. you got the vertical line-of-sight rate killed.
okay. sounds good.

"that's affirm, i'm still free."
"yeah, i recommend they enjoy it as much as we did. i'm sure they will, because, i tell you, we really have - we really have had a lot of sights to see. i'll admit that, in a lot of cases, we worked hard, and - and i suppose the people on the ground were able to tell that. but we got all the support in the world from the - mcc-houston. i - i mean, i could tell, from every decision that came up from the ground, that there had been a lot of work put into it, and all around the country that there were a lot of wheels turning and people working late hours and solving these problems. and i'm just really happy that ken, charlie, and myself got to do this. and i think it's a wonderful experience."
it's absolutely ...

your eyelids are closed.
"yes - i just wanted to take a little break for a minute. jim, why don't you pull your camera up -- and swing it around and get a pan? let me hold the maps for you."
what's happening down on earth?

"be careful, geno. need some help?"
"well, i told you if you watch it. but you got to sit there and watch it. which i ain't - guess i haven't - -"
"we were just discussing that here. used to - in flights gone by, there was a place in the flight plan, a little form to fill out. but we're try- ing to figure out if there is such a place in the current data file. do you know of one?"
i hope it is green when we get it home.
"okay. well, i - i've looked for it on four revs now, and i - i've identified the feature that it looked like it was, and it doesn't look like that at all. it's just a little - just a little soft mound with a crater in it, and it doesn't look any different than all the other craters when you look at it from here."
yes.
"we could probably have done it, but i think that'd really been pushing it."
"okay. no problem, ron. we'll just sit. give us a call when you're back on the air. okay?"
what's that?
what?
jim? jim?
sen of a bitch!
"hey, okay, gordo. we'll do that."
"you, too."
"i think you were right the first time, weren't you?"
looks good.
roger.
"roger. we're gonna have the rest of your flight plan updates for you later in this rev, ken. i notice it's supposed to be your eat period, and i don't want to eat up too much of that, if you'll pardon the expression. so i'll hush up for a while."
... now?
noun 18 is attitude. gimbal angles. there's time.
you think we'll ...?
"you peaked at 105, jack."
"it's just bad, that's all."
"okay; that's verified now, the data systems are on now."
"oh, i'm sorry, bob - -"
i've never seen so many storms ...
"that's breccia, too. that's - -"
"ok_f, fine."
thank you.
"our only thoughts, non, on the - any other position that you might see - you know, if it's above the couch plane and you really think it might be a suspect area, you might consider taping the crack, if you desire. the tape probably isn't going to hold it in if it wants to come tumbling out, but it - it's something you could do if you wanted to."
"okay, we're on hot mike still, john. vhf b data is on. okays tell him go ahead."
right.
"and, nv only question, houston, is do you want me to null the pgns needle manually?"
that must be jones.
"the washer's a little loose, hut that's okay."
"yes, you're right, boy, you're right .... - - 03 lq 46 24 sc (yawn)"

roger; copy.
they are light-colored clods.
"no problem, dave. jim might want to swing the camera around and point it more towards the right."
they said that it would be a while because they warn to get high bit rate. they don't want to put high bit rate ....
(laughter) right.
roger. t plus 3:30 vice t plus 6:30.

"okay, i'm turning off the water."
"okay. serenitatis sulpicius gallus, huh?"
roger. but stand by on breaking the suits down; because it's a debate as to whether we want to do another suit integrity check.
make sure you've got the plug out.
okay.
roger. what's the cmp doing? we haven't heard much from him. is - is he at the other window?
roger.
"easy - easy 0.3, 7.6, but i ... right on the (columbia) southwest end of a crater. i think they would know it if they were in such a location. it looks like their lm would be pitched up quite a degree. it's on the southwest wall of a smallish crater."
"okay, robert. let's see. turn around and i'll get this. what was the last thing - let's see - we had to do?"
negative; we did not. we had too much background noise. can you say again?
what the heck? i said i was going to do the fuel cell - -
"well, how about it, gordy? are we stay or no stay for eva-2 prep?"
...
"okay. and three circuit breakers over on panel 5, ecs radiators, controller, ac i and ac 2, should be closed, and, also, controller heaters, main a should be closed. all three closed."
"bob, did you hear my comment about the - about the sep receiver?"
"stu, apparently you get - do get some particle/ particle collisions, because some of the trajec- tories are back towards us."
"roger. you're coming back a little scratchy. it,looks like our 02 flow transducer's gotten a good bit worse. i just looked at it at the last water accumulator cycling, and it just barely registered - barely crept up above 0.2. over. 02 o1 41 _5 cc roger."
"we'll get on with it, bob."
"put your feet up, al."
one for you and one for me.
"okay. seventy-four hours. 0b 01 49 14 lmp yes. we're not there yet, really. i've got ll minutes to check ... out."
"neil and buzz, this is houston. to clarify my last, your consumables are in good shaoe at this time. the 30-minute reference was with respect to the nominal timeline. over."
"we're at 3.8 here, and we can sample that rim - -"
"okay, right 40."
"what are you hinting there, charlie?"
...
"like if it was one of those 0.15-degree things. that's the only way you gonna tell, is do a - -"
turn it - have it up? l0 03 16 30 imp yeah.
say when.
"16, houston. you're ... is at the top of the scale. you're still okay. you should now monitor rad out"
you got a couple in the roll pretty soon.
"okay, i didn't want to mislead you. i mean, you can get ready to spin it up. we'll give you the go to spin up."
"say, i never thought - you guys want to take a look - look at - excuse me a second. i'm going to turn out those floodlights. i wanted to show ... - when i turn out all the lights in just a second, you can see thunder and lightning on the horizon."
"houston, endeavour. if you're copying the dsky, you'll see residuals: .2, .2, and .3; so no trim."
"hey, you ..."
"we - when we get in, we want to cheek over all those damn - books, make sure we got them. oh, i put them all in my mouth, pete; sorry. wasn't thinking."
watch your hoses. let me disconnect these because we don't need those dadgum things around like that. okay; now can you spin around there? 05 06 19 15 cdr-i_m yeah. here comes all the checklist and cards.
"okay, i'm just about overhead now."
that has a completely - it has a completely dif- ferent - texture to it than the domical structures of altken.
- - is rug - is undu - it's different.
and we will want to still check it prior to your sleep period.
how much - how much time we got here?
you have high gain to auto. · f
"okay. stand by. i'll give you volts and amps. okay. the voltage is 39.1; amps, 1.75."
- - so my maneuver is not going to hurt them.
how do you do it?
"yes, got that. 03 06 39 42 i_p _24s_unction's off."
... mapping camera right now ....
"ken, you should have seen old percy precision, here, plant this beauty dowm[ i'm tellin' you_"
"mark it, i minute."
"okay, here's one about the same size. you're a little too big. take this one right here, jimmer. oh, i see a large chunk in there."
"okay, 17. we've got about 30 seconds left for that gravimeter reading. you want to be finishing up the task and getting back toward the rover."
okay.
"oh, it's in the checklist somewhere."
okay. we copy the low gain hooked up.
"*** wrapped in *** if you put it end down, it msy stay in the bag."
"okay, ron."
let me - okay; how's that?
"say again, jim. we were cycling over to relief dump at the time (chuckle)."
"roger, jim. good morning. the first - - l0 21 49 l0 _ good morning, joe."
"okay. go back to normal? o0 o0 kl ok lmp not yet. here it comes. 00 00 41 08 cml:' all right, regulator b is coming on. o0 00 41 l0 _ okay. ("
okay. and it is auto. okay.
"okay. the docking probe circuit breakers are going to open. okay. extend/releases, and they went gray, of course, when they went open. okay. extend/release to off. verify probe extend latch engage indicator not visible. well, i'll go back - it wasn't awhile ago, but i'll go look again. only if you hit extend with the circuit breakers in. mighty fine. it's still back inside there. extend latch is still engaged."
ail righty.
"not really, but - okay - -"
"that's what i read, and i'll stay in sim bay jets."
okay. felt pretty good. we'll get organized and give you a call here in a few minutes.
"well, i was hoping i could say yes, but i don't think i do. let us go back here and - it looks like there is one little ridgeline that goes around a - a - it'd he that first crater that they come up to. it's flag or spook. i'm upside down in my thinking that way, too. i've got the cinco craters and - those terraces that we talked about that were over in - in stone mountain don't stand out very well from here. looks to me like you've got a lot of the same lineations that we've seen in the other places - looks like some slumping further around than where they're going to be going up. i don't think they'll be able to recognize terraces as such."
okay.
"facing away from myself, huh? okay."
roger.
okay. i'll give you the commander's food from yesterday°
okay. one correction - the red hose that's con- nected up right now to the lithium cartridge in the lmp's - wait a minute.
"well, there's no choice, right now. let me see if these little ones will fit in there. stand by. i want to put this one in there, too."
"okay. we're heading out, tony."
"it's all frosted, pete."
()kay. stand by.
okay. ems is going normal. the old trans control power's on .... delta-v thrust a switch .... ullage.
"roger. and, 15, be advised we'll have a flight plan update in the near future."
"and we got one last item here, which is entitled ""slick trick by an eager beaver"" from flint, michigan. dedication to duty is fine, say flint city officials, but the man who turned several miles of city streets into an ice rink carried that concept too far. he had been told to use the city water truck to wash the streets tuesday morning. he did. dutifully ignoring the 3 degrees below freezing temperature. his trail was clearly marked by irate drivers trying to navigate their dented cars over the glassy surface. officials said salt crews were dispatched, but the sun came out and melted the problem before they did."
smells kind of funny in there. what'd you guys do? (laughter)
"okay, dave."
okay; fine.
"yes, but i still think we were straighter -"
"and, amer - houston, america; i missed t2 on."
set window bars.
"well, let's try it. you have a -"
okay; i guess we're just looking for a variety then in the boulder protocol.
"okay, we're going biomed, right. how do you read now, pete? 01 10 oh 03 cc loud and clear. 01 10 0h 05 lmp okay, you want to - we can - we're down tc step 5 on page 1-118 - 1-18. do you want to look at the high bit rate some more? 01 10 oh 33 cc negative. we don't want to look at it anymore."
"negative. 02 03 38 55 _ pete, i'm back on the bio_/yed. how does it look?"
"okay; just about have you, houston. but not quite."
houston marks it.
"chariie, you got me almost to pdi there. 04 03 43 11 l_p well, i tried hard. ob 03 43 12 cdr you did good. 04 03 h3 18 lmp but if the gear don't work. %'ell, maybe they'll come up with something."
"roger, jim. the part i got was correct, but we had a loss of con_ for the first part. would you read the - about the first l0 back to me again? 03 04 45 15 iaip roger. tei-4, sps/g&n; 40015. 03 04 45 49 _ houston, this is 15. did you get all the readback?"

they say everything looks fine. (no comm for 35 minutes)
"charlie, we're thinking about it. we'll get back to you in a minute."
and the last point is dvm of 670 and a delta-v - abort delta-v of 2_75.

"(laughter) and it looks like they're probably the same thing that we sampled. they have the inclu- sions in them, white inclusions. they look like a mixture of gray and the - sort of a tan-gray of the - the gray of the recrystallized breccia, and the tan-gray of the anorthositic gabbro."
"and, ken, if we have to do that, we'd suggest you mark a place down there so that, during the sub- sequent ptcs · you can just set the thing to that mark."
"casper, omni delta."
"0h, thank you much. but you guys made it awful easy."
"time number 53 he's said that that. go ahead, ken."
i'll go back in ...
- - but now it's getting in an area where you're getting something.
floods to postlanding.
i'll buy that.
"i sure had it plugged in. i had it plugged in the night before last, too. i don't understand that."
"okay, charlie. thank you."
"houston, 1_. i have you on the high gain."
you work mighty hard.
"okay. go ahead with th,_ ..."
no.
"okay, got those."
"how you read me, dick? okay?"
copy that.
okay. 04 18 00 24 lm}' put this back on?
"okay, gordy. i had the angles m_tched on the steerable and went to slew, and they - it held for a few seconds and then dropped off."
range ... switch off.
- - barber pole. and that was at 20 - 22:30.
"okay. down in the next paragraph where it's got the 06 40 and the emergency procedures for the flash- ing 97 40 for the sps thrust fail, scratch the line that re_ds ""delta-v thrust b paren a, normal,"" and insert ""circuit breaker spspilot valve main a, closed."""
"apollo 15, houston. you can start your maneuver to jettison attitude at any time. and i have a slight update to the attitude."
"now, now. i know what i'll do. i'll fold my tent. suit donning. ahl an exercise in futility. the - the thing is that what we have to do now is, after suit donning, we still - when we go to doff the suits now we still got to go back and stow stuff in the places that was gonna originally have been stowed."
"we're at 2.4, about. so we'll just let your flow bring it up to 3. gee, i had a great view on the tv. did y_u turn the tv of_f,jim?"
"okay, what you're really saying is that except for this - these two special things, we're just gonna do what we always do, right?"
i'll give it to him.
mark. you have s-ivb to coi now.
"okay. t-stop is 54:38 and we'll go to standby at that time. tape switch. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7; standby."
okay. go on up; stay clean.
...
roger.
"okay, 17. we'd like you to press on. we'll abort the radial sample. we'd like to leave here in_ne- diately, if not sooner, to head for station 10. enough of the 500 millimeters, gene. and we'll give you some information here on mags. we need the gravimeter put back on the rover, if you haven't already. if it's on the ground, we didn't get the mark, but it's probably done by now. and we're going to take the dsea out of the tape recorder here, and we'd like to get that all done pronto."
"what did you say, tony?"
affirmative.
wait a minute. *** to make sure this is out of the way *** i come in.
i don't know why - it was hard to put on. surprised it came off. here let me - let me hold the end.

"roger, jack. 54:58:50. thank you."
"okay. 11 11 44 37 _ dave, i hope we're going to be able to see them unload all those rocks."
"hey, i forgot to cut - i didn't cut the ion off."
okay.
"there are lots of comments for that one, bob; but i'd better not say anything."

okay.
check the pressures on that.
"okay. well, i guess i'll go ahead and put the bag - that i have here in src 2."
"hey, jim?"
"hey, now."
nice little rocks.
"okay, orion; houston. you should have all your updates. i - we 'ye gone around the room again and there's nothing coming up. (no con for 37 minui_s) 05 21 21 12 lmp-i_ okay, houston; orion. over."

"orion, this - this is houston. in answer to your question, charlie. if you were to lose source pressure right now, you could get 35 percent out."
"sure. sure, go head."
"okay, see if i can -"
gas sample tube coming up.
copy.
"cabin repress, close."
"okay, with respect to food - let's see, we gave you a - intermediate report yesterday. do you want that repeated?"
that's exactly our thinking.
"well, i'll be doggoned."
yes. hold it just a minute; we'll be right with you.
"it - i took it off and threw it away. it's gonna be - i bet you all this stuff up here is really shocked, houston. you want any that's - does that make any difference to you? - and, therefore, is not gonna be too hard."
i don't want to end up in the water with my dump valve open.
"well, you're right. sorry. i don't have much control (lal_gbter)."
did you enjoy the launch?
... cmp. i finally got my suit on now.
okay. the reactant valve is going to ...
"okay, sep pad is at 102.30, all zeros. aridon this circ pad, ignition 103:21:42.43_ noun 81 plus 0069.1, plus all zeros, minus 00_3.5. over_ 04 06 26 28 _2_-i_ okay. hoyefuily_ that's a sep pad. ken got 103:21:43; plus 0006.9 - correcvion, plus 0069.!_ minus all bails, minus 0043.5. over."

okay. just going - -
"cut the rim of the crater, jim. i bet we can do a good one right there,"
hey - -

"by golly, we did it again."

"gene, i've got to get out of your way."
we certainly will.
okay.
"apollo ll, this is houston_ go ahead."
roger.
"15, houston. that's excellent. i guess we can go ahead with pressure - pressurizing the lm."
you want me to hold back awhile and -
okay. tape ?7/ll
"go ahead, aquarius."
"ail right. okay. we're - we're still in fm, are we not?"
okay. hf antenna 2 is off. it maintained barber pole all the time there. iv never went gray until we turned it off.
"okay, ron. you've got to load your noun 89s, or maybe i missed it and we just want to remind you that we'd like b/d roll configured and we will be using b/d roll for the rest of the mission. cmlp oh, okay. you want to change the old dap here - did i miss that somewhere?"
"okay. copy that, jack. stop thinking and take pi ctures. i/_p-eva go by that little dark crater over there. there's a very blocky-rim small crater that's a dark-rim crater instead of a bright rim like we'd seen some around that looked fresh. it partly may be the angle at which we're approaching it."
roger. let's do that.
okay. thank you.
"okay, 509's out of there. how's it look?"
"151, 12.0, and 001. well, wait a minute. *** get your bag."
okay. we copy that.
okay_ you have it.
"we'll use this, too."
you got the dsea? j
"and, and, and - i mean he was watching the red and white to see if it was taking a picture, and we noticed that we - after we got done, all the 500-millimeter stuff that - we knew we had taken approximately 100 pictures, but the counter only read 60. and we kicked that around for quite a while, and we finally concluded that because a1 had been watching, that there was something wrong with the counter and we really had taken all the pictures. so we decided that we'd use up the rest of that film on targets of opportunity. and while a1 was taking the pictures out the window, the side of the magazine just popped off_ right out of nowhere, for no reason, and it opened up about one-eighth of an inch and al tried to jam it back on and he had to actually open the lock and put it back on."
"and apollo 13, another item: something that we have observed and you might be seeing is a slight tce fluctuation on fuel cell 3. this fluctuation has been going from about 152 to 160 over a 37-second period. it has been seen on other flights in the past. no one is worried about it, but the usual fluctuation is about l-l/2 degrees instead of 7 seconds, so i thought you should be aware of it."
gordy. that particular depression doesn't look like it's an impact-generated depression at all.
am i closing any yet?
"ron, we are probably going to lose you a little early on this half_ and we may pick you up a little late at the start of the next half, unless you were to try and acquire us mauually, or some- thing like that. if you go via the flight plan, which is really what we want, we will be coming in a little bit later than is shown. if you have to talk to us or anything like that, you can acquire manually, and we'll be right there. 05 22 38 21 cml° manually, yes. okay. i was just looking at the earth out of window 3 here. boy, that's beauti- ful! i have an earthset pretty quick."
"11, houston. the exact range is 125 _o0 miles, and you're traveling 4486 feet per second. 01 08 53 29 lm__ pretty far and pretty slow. just past halfway. 01 08 53 48 i2__ hey, charlie, what the latest on luna 157"
"al, this ia houston. we need to have you stand still again."
now we're going to take l0 frames at 30-second intervals. give me a mark on your first one.
that was really a super burn. right on the money.
"okay, america. we're ready for the maneuver now."
okay.
i'll move back. stand by.
"that's affirmative, j_m. all other bresd_ers in that row are as you see them in the checklist. and on row 5, the only change is _n_o wu ...... you to, under eps, open ascent eca control. over."
still not gray?
"okay, gordo. we're ready - dps throttle check. i'm ready to hit engine stop."

"okay, we got 43,000 feet, ken."
"- - was just glad you're happy. 05 08 22 b0 cmp i thought it was kind of interesting. yeah, i thought it was kind of interesting and i don't know whether it's because i'm in a 60-mile orbit or whether it's because there is only one guy in here adding heat to the atmosphere. i guess we'll decide that when john and charlie climb in. 05 08 22 5b cc one explanation is that you lost two roommates; but, also, my cabin ran what i thought a little chilly, and do you notice it getting a - gets a little clrmmy going through dark pass?"

"falcon, houston. bring up your steerable, please - -"
roger. mighty fine. we'll watch it as you are coming on in and let you know then th_ intelligi- bility is up. we'll make a _oice check with you at that time.
"keep it in, and it's all on and locked."
i got all that.
"yes. it's - i'm in manual that i'm staying in then, now."
"charlie, you got me. i can't tell. 05 03 12 ]8 cc okay. could we have another range and bearing, please?"

yes. we saw the sim bay - almost oblique - but saw the whole thing. we're looking right down your tailpipe at the surface.
okay. you ready to go_ then?
roger. going to aft omni.
"you just passed the subsolar point, ken, about 3 or 4 minutes ago."
*#* it goes. *## it. thank you.
"no, we've got it all on tape. go ahead. okay, with respect to food yesterday - lmp: scram- bled eggs, four bacon squares, orange-pineapple drink, cocoa, potato soup, two peanut butter, two jelly, two bread, cherry bar, orange-grapefruit drink, beefsteak, orange drink, and tea."
okay.
"planning purposes, while you got food open, is to stick a couple of juice bags into the - in some- body's tsb for post-eva. because it's going to be awhile after that before we get around to getting unsuited and all that jazz."
"i'm trying to find a level spot, bruce. we're in- -"
"..., al?"
"no, sir."
"yes. it appears if we track those we, obviously, aren't going to be on the attitude that we burned the last midcourse."
can you - can you put that away?
okay.

"yes. it seemed to happen at the time i put the plus x thrust to it, and apparently it wasn't centered, because somehow or other i acciden- tally got off in attitude and then the attitude hold system started firing."
okay. that's done.
"no, we had the window shields up before."
okay. wh_t -
roger-roger.
it's bag 26-n.
"helium valves. you got two in auto, right?"
"okay, houston. reading back 382, secondary evaporator h20 control valve's off, and primary evaporator h20 control valve, off."
okay. wait a second.
"hey, bob, your hourly weather report is due and - (laughter) i'll wait awhile. i keep losing your comm."
"no, it isn't - -"
"okay. and now, i'll stop and rate them here; seems like a good time. i guess target a was ex:_remely good all the way along. target b, also, was _uite easy to recognize. but here again, prim - primarily because of the - of the sun shining on the - on the crater rim. an older, more diffuse crater would be more difficult to pick up, but with those - with those bright - bright rims - bright si_e :o - both targets a and b, it was really no problem. okay. and my last picture, i will give you a mark. when it goes off, it'll be a little past 12:32. 04 16 09 21 c_ and - 0k 16 09 22 cmp mark. last picture on target 4. camera is off. 04 16 11 11 c_ okay. i'll get to moving here, and then i'll pick me up at - oh, maybe between 50 mhd 58. first frame number should be eight. - onfidential"
"okay. i've got them right here; when they get ready to go. ought to be going with our suits, now."
"okay. roger on that. i guess - let us think about it here overnight. offhand, our opinion is, as long as you've got a spare headset, let's wear the spare headset - that spare meaning a light- weight. if you're going to be on comm tonight, i guess we offhand suggest wearing the lightweight tonight. over. how does that strike you?"
"oh, i don't think he'll have any confusion with that."
"hello, houston. this is al."
"everything on this sep is coming off harder than it did in the - when we deployed it at the cape. see that? it just ... it may not be harder, but it ..."
"okay, gene. and you got the scb number 2 in and the pallet out, right?"
"okay. hang right there, jim, for a minute."
attitude transmitter is 3.7; velocity's 3.8.
smell. it's ...
"okay, casper. we have you visually. 07 07 46 23 cml° glad to hear that. t don't have you yet. 07 07 46 39 cml° houston, casper is standing by."
"okay, houston. we're working some mapping stuff. the burn was completely nominal. we'll give you the status report in - just as soon as we finish here."
"in fact - hey, why don't you turn around?"
"i'll tell you, i'll get my switch set done first before i eat so i won't disturb jim any."
"okay. spacecraft control, scs; rrc 2, ar_ed. 03 09 50 48 c_p scs and rhc, armed."
okay. we've got 0180 and 0 on the old thumbwheels.
"one minute. ems ... 03 02 27 32 cml° translation power, we don't need. the light is out. delta-v thrust a is coming on -"
yes.
"aquarius, houston. stand by on opening your circuit breakers for displays. we're going to let you know what they are, and i have some gyro torquing angles for you."
"roger. it's - it's open, jim."
just pull it on out.
"roger. copy. 09 23 02 34 lmi° mark. faint white dot on the left eye, lower in- board - duke."
"i'm just looking it over. just a second. okay; i'm going - i'm on _ way to the p52 attitude, which we're gonna get, i guess, here in daylight. that should be no problem. that's why we're gonna do a pulse torque, and i'll open the alpha/x-ray covers and get the x-ray on. and at time 51, i'm gonna try to do a verb _9 to the moulton attitude, which is 225, 233, and 358, to be there at 170:20. i'll then do those - pictures, and try to start them at 170:28. if i get in attitude, i'm gonna ch_lge the dap to 10102. then do a maneuver to the antisolar point at 279, 223, and 356. and those pictures should begin at 170:36. at the conclusion of that sequence, i'll turn the dap to 10101."
"gordy, if you like, i'll go ahead and maneuver now."
roger. he's coming back to look for you.
"al, you want to check that? 00 o0 44 29 _ i'm going to go through a secondary glycol loop check here."
"a chunk of yellow-brown rock that apparently has several spots behind it, probably indicating di- rection from which it came - oh, no - what is that? that's a reflection (laughter). that really fooled me. a reflection off the mylar (laughter). crazy. well, what the heck, i'll sample it anyway."
"okay, be with you - okay, that's in block. and do you remember the guys - i think the folks from marshall - saying that they thought if you had bubble of water and you hit it with another bubble in zero g that one bubble ought to go through the other one?"
when you've locked on.
"orion, will you go normal voice?"
i knew i was gonna do that. i knew it.
"okay. roger, hadley base. taking it from the r top, we're going to ask you to stop first at the alsep site and spend a few minutes recovering the successfully drilled core tube and, then follow that with the grand prix photography. from there press on towards station 9, as planned. we're going to skip the delta stop in between. station 9 is exactly as we planned it. from station 9, up to station 10, exactly as we planned o_t, and at station 10, we're going to hit a branch point. we can update you there when you arrive at station 10. the two options are basically, to head north for the complex_ although we think it's more probable we'll just want to loop back towards the north across alligator chain doing good mare sampling, and wind up at quark west crater, that's the western crater of the quark triplet, and use that as a station 14 stop. over."
"okay, it is. i think it is, yes. 06 03 17 21 i_mp-eva yes, that's - that's one for the next eva."
"i know it. i can see that. just take your time. when you're satisfied, go. but dcn't go until you're satisfied."
"right there, huh? that -"
i thought you'd like that (laughter).
"we're going to light your fire today, babe."
"jack, there's a big - a big one right there in my floor pan. that's what i did last time."
okay.
"john, i guess they would like you to try to move it away from that rock and - on the distance, just as - just as far as you can without getting - getfing it in trouble there - jerking it around."
i found a way to get over cables.
why didn't i get a p507
"you know, we don't have the deep craters anymore. the deepest around here may be half a meter or so, and we don't have the rocks, the debris on the surface; just a few. as a matter of fact, right here at 347, range 4.0, it's pretty smooth."
"outstanding. you have accept. l_ and, while we are getting a tei refsm_t, there's a fairly striking graben on the very north edge of fecunditatis, south of crisi_n - just south of crisium. and it starts in the west within the fecunditatis mare and then curves gradually up through the sculptured hills structure to the north. and, there's a crater, looks like a subdued impact crater, right on that structure, and you can see the trace of the graben down vhe walls - the west wall of the crater and ur the east wall. and it does - from directly overhead, it appears to taper downward. the walls of the graben, thav is, get closer together as it approaches the bottom of the crater. and on the south wall of the graben_ as exposed in the west wall of the crater, there's a fairly sharp - sharply defined white area in the talus."
okay.
okay.
"roger, we understand that. it is strictly a downlink problem and you can stay in the down voice backup mode if you want. if we get involved in conversation, i think we'll want to go back to normal voice."
okay. 04 20 13 57 ia_ okay. right here.
okay. i think you can zoom in a little more. let's try 40 here.
okay.
okay. back to the high-gain angles.
"okay, 17. we had a slight changeover over there, and we've got you again."
pga pressure.
and out to the side - there you go.
"roger, 11. we don't have to worry about it any more. the altimeter out there is now standard, 29.92; but basically what it means is that if i give you a plus 10 feet, for instance, that means that you will hit the water with the ailtimeter reading 10 feet. over."
"roger, pete. we concur. p"
"yes, sir."
"oh, shoot!"
we _bop..v

for some reason - -
"it was so funny; but, after csi, i couldn't get a word out of him. he just goes ... got him all pissed off."
"and, a1 and ed, for your stop for the e, we'd like that - take an estimated one-crater diameter short of the crater - north crater,"
"okay. the next one going straight down the line, ""2721, 2521, and 2316."" that's all the changes on the vgo line."
"excuse me, jim. 08 04 28 28 i24p excuse me."
roger.
"0_ay_ dave. and we're standing by for progress as to how that goes. 05 21 42 3_ cdr okay, joe. i think we're goi_lg tc take the top inch off of the antenna and use it as a splice."

"what we need is a check valve that we can close or get to, to isolate that port, if we could get one."
yep. 07 22 24 35 imp all they supposed to do.
one.
"i have an rcs light, houston."
let me get the contingency tool and try to push those things closed.
"ron, when you get the tunnel closed out, i'll need you for an imu coarse align."
"we got you, bob."
...
"yes, why don't you go get the rake and let me - let's see - i want to roll the rock over - -"
"go ahead, gene."
"that's your sextant check, really."
"what kind of film we got? oh, i got the wrong film in the mag. right - let's see, there's yerkes, and then on the side of the slope, come yerkes and then there's about a 50-kilometer crater, then there's a subdued crater, and right on the western rim of crisium - in the western edge of that subdued crater, it's almost a 70-degree slope down there, and it's a square straight slope on the thing. _aere doesn't seem to be any ejecta piled up in the bottom of it at all, but within the slope - and it must be 50 - about - yes, 50 kilometers long, and there's a bright impact crater on the top of the hill, top of the rim, right below that bright cra- ter, you have the tannish brown streak that goes through the whole slide. the rest of the slope itself is the bright, light - real light, light tan, i call it. i'll find the name of that crater on the map in a minute, but - -"
let me turn around here. 04 23 h3 38 cdr-lm - - ... yes. 04 23 43 40 ibr°-lm see what might be - _-- 04 23 43 51 lmp-lm feel like i'm caught.
"okay, bob, the hatch is back in."
could have sworn that goddam thing was right - right here.
"- - along the rim. and, we can - minimize the distance."
"but, i'm still getting my balance. i didn't touch the ground. just got to get some of this cable out of here."
... five.
okay. copy that. stand by 1.
yes. l
"okay, jack."
"i tell you, the spotlight isn't nearly as good as earthshine. i'm really surprised."
"okay, houston. america here. the mapper - when we took the image motion from off to on and then the mapping camera switch from off to on also, i think - maybe it was standby to on - but anyhow, as soon as it went up to on, we had a barberpole on the talkback. went back to standby, and just before aos, or just about aos there, at - to 215 - 20, about 215:20, then we got a gray on the talk- back with the mapping camera switch to standby. then we went back through the cycle, and it worked okay. so it's working now and it's on. what i'm saying is i didn't start working until about 20."
st_md by.
"you know, i think we - you know, i pl-nned to use this bag because i thought we had about 3 days on it. now, i'm gonna throw it away, and we got - -"
"okay, go ahead."
"not just yet, jack."
"how's the time line, bob?"
yeah.
"okay, gene."
roger.
"okay, here's that other one. it had to fall right here. l&ip-eva i don't think it ever - is that - there it is; get your tongs."
... okay.
"ken, how do you read?"
start the dac.
"in fact, it looks like it's leaking. it is leaking. it's leaking, dave."
"okay, challenger; america. i got you 49 miles now. okay?"
"... beautiful. now, the sun's shining right through the window. that's the last picture i'm going to get of you."
i don't think we need the data card kit out right now.
"that would be fine, john."
"we have some horizontal banding in our tv monitor. are we transmitting that to you, or do you have a clear picture?"
okay. i'm going to press into that.
"okay, aquarius. and down here we're getting re- grouped, trying to work on your control modes and trying to set up something for ptc and taking a look at consumables as opposed to flight plan, and so forth, and as soon as we get all that in- formation, we'll pass it up to you. we also have the 14 backup crew over in the simulators looking at dock burns and also trying to see what kind of alinement procedures they can come up with for looking at stars out the window. so if you ever are able to see any stars out there and think you can do an alinement out the window, why let us know."
- - and you try to get it and you can't quite get there. yes.
"- - and you'll be 17,000 feet south."
... yes. i think you just about - -
"16, go omni delta."
thank you.
"and just to refresh your memory, the v over h sen- sor is the one that's on the right side that's got the little hood on it. 08 22 46 47 c_ld okay."
okay; we're a_xious]:z awaiting them.

"now, ... well, there's nothing we can do. that hard stuff doesn't want to come out of there, pete."
"okay; that is at 78:18, it's '_dosps cue card through gimbal drive."""
roger on that.
"three, six, ... 144, all zips, 1.53, that's csi time."
roger.
"i think the suit circuit's tight. i think that just might have been one of those things, because the last one we ran was real good. it - the flow dropped down to like, 6 or 7/10ths, i guess, and it would have stayed there all day long. i think we've got a good suit loop, but - i'm not worried about that at all. just a matter of getting all the connectors cleaned up so they all work well. and insuring that everybody gets a good lock-lock."
roger.
"okay. 04 09 54 19 cml= i want to mark something on _y chart, and then i'll talk to you for just a minute."

"crater, if you will. i know you didn't get a chance to look at it because - if we can tie up the - what you see from orbit on shorty to what we know we've got from the ground truth, we might really have something here, as far as matching up on some of these other craters."

"***, too."
"- - depends on what effect that has on - no] i can't, hank. it's just a piece of something that's out there, and it's tumbling so that it gives you an occulting reflection. no field at all for it, but it's moving in approximately the same velocity that we are."
"okay. we'll find out. and, charlie, we've got some changes to your lunar surface checklist. whenever it's convenient for you, we'll send them up to you."
...
okay. and give me an 06 20.
"boy, i certainly don't see much variety other than the gray and the tan subfloor variety. there's old challenger."
it counted that time.
si.
"well, i went to all vhe trouble, i'm going to eat something."
that's affirmative. we read you loud and clear all the way. we haven't figured it out either.
yes. that's all right.
"roger. that seems hardly worth it on that, jack. sorry on that one. just one last note, general note on all this we gave you. everything has been checked in the cms. you probably figured that anyway."
"okay. and, orion, i've got block data and a note from the surgeon and a battery-management proce- dure at about 164 hours any time you're ready to copy."
"here, let me get this big one. i'm about ready to drop it. *** like a gabbro."
"that - that's all in an agreement that i've got with spencer, karl. i think right now, we're too busy to do that, and after we get the landing out f_ of the way, we'll go back and recap all the film and start from scratch."
okay.
yes.
"hello, 16; houston. how do you read?"
"roger, jim - -"
yes. *** looks - looks like we got 900 feet of this stuff.
"this is the one on panel l, is it? or - the mission timer? -- 05 05 o1 27 cml° that's affirm."
"the page number is c/2-28, and the bag is down in the - in the l-shaped bag, they tell me. 05 03 00 14 cml° roger. i've got the bag out."
yes.
roger.
"oh, just - is it just over here underneath the docking ring that it's off? o0 08 09 38 _ yeah. well, i can see the edge of that panel over here and over there."
"and that's not on the map, either. it doesn't even show up. i guess - i guess my opinion of this place is that on our - on our traverse maps, the rimless features - the very old, subdued, rim- less craters - they just don't even show up, and they're just not there hardly."
okay. got it?
"no more on the gravimeter, huh?"
"- - windows on your side. 00 01 25 36 lm_ yes, out this one ..."
"roger. and what was the relative sequence on selecting water separator number 2 and the secondary c02 canister; that is, did you go to the secondary water separator first and then the secondary c027 over."
too bad we don't have a camera.
"that's correct. okay. next page, 1 - -"
"that might be crisium ever there, fred."
"i'm looking at that surveyor. we can look around that crater - on the left side. that looks like bedrock over there, doesn't it?"
roger.
"yes, we've got b duplex - b simplex on, apparently left over from the lm checks. i suspect i should turn that off. right? 03 11 55 _0 cc that's affirmative."
"no, i heard it go every single time .... here it go. all i could hear ... it'il go without moving .... 06 20 56 32 i.,mp you don't have anything on that roll ..."
okay. i haven't heard of anything. you did get a news report this morning? is that correct?
"yes. i updated times in there, too."
"houston, apollo 11."
"okay, gene. that's a pretty big rock in there."
"yes, bu% i've _ot to get my hands down right now. 5, 6, 7 - rrt?"
"okay. the two that we want closed are sequencer a and sequencer b. over. 03 20 33 37 cmap okay, panel 250."
"it's column delta, row 5."
"can't stand clear of it, because - should have left the treadle down there."
okay; copy.
okay. 08 l0 03 47 imp ...
"okay, you ought to be changing 5.6."
that's the best i can do; i guess.
"now, this fresh crater that we're coming up ahead. i - i know we've - we talked about it but i don't know whether - it had - it looked - whether there was any bedrock."
"2000 feet, 60 on profile."
okay. done.
...
are you going to get it?
"okay. you're loud - well, you're about 3 by, gordy, but very clear. 01 17 3k 16 cc okay, jack. we can hear about 1 by 1 in the midst of a lot of noise, but we could tell you're sounding much better."
"roger; could you give us the - your noun 93s? we'd - had lost data at that point. 04 06 44 10 i_mp-lm yeah, sorry about that, jim. here they are: the star angle difference was 4 balls 1, minus 4 balls 1; our torque angles were minus 0.067, plus 0.108, plus 0.050; torqued at 104:42:25."
they said that'd be okay.
"orion. roger. 07 07 04 15 _p-_d okay, jim, we got an rcs caution light and rcs a reg light on right now."
it's sitting right there in the end of the track. there are tracks all over that hillside. there's a boulder came right down to the surface there. see it?
"good idea. gdc's ... in there; we're down to 6 minutes, huh?"
"okay. in 2 minutes, we have an angle of 55.7. we're working on one for 5 minutes later."
"okay, i'm getting the - probe umbilicals installed now."
"well, it's sure downhill all - all the way back, isn't it?"
"i was just going to say we took time out here to grab something to eat, cause it's been a long time between breakfast and lunch so a - i will try and do a little inventory here and give you a page and let you know about where it is."
"roger. now, we want you to rock the hand con- troller full left and right - and watch the ammeter while you do that on the batteries. and look for small deflections in those _mmeter readings."
i think i understand.
"okay, joe. thank you. apollo 15 air-t0-ground voice transcription"
"thank you. am i bumping now? 04 15 38 33 i24p no, you're clear. you're rubbing up against me a little bit."
"let me get another check, here."
roger.
"okay. thank you, sir."
"okay,jim. the readback is right on. i've got a tei-75 preliminary pad and a flight plan update pad, when you're ready."
"apollo 15, houston. over."
"challenger, america. read you loud and clear. how me?"
"what's that, gene?"
"okay, while you're - i've got some words on your - on your orbit here, which won't require anything - writing down anything - but for some reason you're missing the mascons or something, and your orbit's not degrading like we expected it to. it's not degrading down into a circular orbit. it's - i think it's staying just about the way it was, and so we're looking ahead to a plane change, and we're - we're thinking about an extra maneuver prior to plane change - about i hour prior to plane change on the back side. there was some discussion here about what to call that maneuver. somebody wanted to call it a ham, height adjustment maneuver, and someone else said, well that one's already used in the rendezvous sequence. maybe we ought to make it ""bacon."" and even ""lox"" was was suggested, considering the fdos objected to ""bacon"" because of his religion. so the ""lox"" was eliminated because ·we already used that for the s-ivb."
"all right, that's all."
"okay. you're loud and clear, ron. how me?"
"bob, we are on the *** - or northeastern rim of cochise. i'm going to work my way around the other side. l_ip-eva and, bob, looking at the - -"
"okay, al. that's good, and the next two items are deletes over at 196 plus 31. and that is, delete - -"
"okay. we're going to - this next _rocedure that i have to read up to you is probably going ye be the one that we'll use to try to get around that. and also, we'd like you to use it in the p52s because it allows vs to monitor for the glitch, and at the same time _revents the glitch from bringing your platform down. 02 02 ho 44 cmp okay."
you know that -
roger. i bravo; we're go at i minute.
"oh, that's a nice one-handed first step. godspeed the crew of apollo 17. i'm going to keep reading that. i like that message. how's captain america, speaking of apollo 17."
"yes, sir."
yeah. i know.
okay; understand. mass spec discriminator to high.
"all angular, though, i'll tell you that. here's one with a white streak, looks like a caliche streak through it. leave it. that's all; it's a white rock."
okay. i'm going to drop the *** now for the for- ward dump valve.
"16, give us p00 and accept, and we'll give you your up-links, and then you can maneuver."
that's good. that's good.
are we in auto?
"a couple of items, jim. the first is, the time for closing the waste stowage vent is 12:24. if you turn in before that time, why it's okay as far as we're concerned down here to close it before that time just before you go to bed. the second point, we have some results on the p23s, and, if jack's interested, we could give him the corrected altitudes we're getting, and so forth."
"yeah, uh-huh. okay, tony; is one scoopful enough?"
t-start: 148:07:14; t-stop: 148:17:14.
"we now have some words for you. and we're ready to up-link to you, endeavour, if you will give us po0 and accept."

"where i took it. okay; that was adjacent to the trench. i'm indexing the 3, and i'm going to do the trench bottom."
i would rather see that we do the most nominal things that the world has ever seen.
i think i'll make a cup of coffee.
"manual throttle, commander."
"apollo 11, this is houston. over."
six.
"yeah, i gave you bum dope. i was calling that 90, but it was 95."
i guess soo
"okay, we'd love to have it. go ahead."
yeah.
"well, i'll - i'll give that a try, gordy. i think the thing we had hoped to accomplish at taurus-littrow was to look at a - as broad a spectrum of the history of the moon as possible in one small area, as the concluding flight to the apollo program. and i think we did that. i think we had look - did look at some of the oldest rocks that it is possible to see with our capability in the breccias of the south and north massifs. i think we saw some intermediate-age rocks of fairly unexpected character, i believe, in the subfloor crystalline or igneous rocks, the gabbro, as we called them there. and we also understood, i think, that those rocks, in fact, had intruded into the breccias of the north massif. we found, i believe, in the - at the crater van serg, on the third eva, that the regolith, or the garden zone, on the top of that subfloor gabbro, or the igneous rocks, was quite thick, or appears to be very thick, which is an expected result, and will - hopefully, those rocks will have much information about a fairly extended period of lunar erosion. and, we found that there was indeed a dark mantle over the area of - variable thickness; but, apparently, of relatively recent age, and that in turn had a light mantle of material of which we do not yet understand, and i think that the samples are going to have to tell that story. it may well be a land slide that has come off the south massif. and, then, possibly as important as any finding, we found that even later than that relatively young light mantle deposit are avalanche - possible avalanche - we have alteration reminiscent of the alteration by hot waters or hot gases on earth, and that was the orange - appears to be the orange soil that we found around the crater shorty. and, subsequently, in orbit we started to pick up, and particularly through ron evans' efforts, pick up more of the apparent evidence of such alteration taking place in fairly recent time on the moon. all of those items, i think, are extremely significant and go through the full range of our present knowledge of lunar history. and, a report i would write would initially summarize that particular sequence of events."

"good morning up there. say, i think we may have driven your high gain into the stops. could you check on 225 the high gain flight bus and group 2? if one's out, push it in."
"yes. 04 13 38 19 _ 110:20:37. okay, it's going to be 38, so 38 from 60 is 22. where can i put these - don't forget to put these - -"

you're mode ii. 03 11 26 57 cml° loose rules now?
"okay, joe. i got the gyro torquing angles up, and i'll torque them out in a minute."
this is really something. the most unreal looking :real thing i've ever seen. if that makes any sense (laughter). ll8 confidential 03 12 10 53 _ probably not.
"hold it, dave. let me get your - keep - keep coming down; i'll push this in."
"ail righty. it's reading straight, now."
"hey, i'll pass that along to the skylab - -"
"and, dave. can you verify, were you behind, in local vertical, or body attitude coordinates?"
and the hatch looked clear when i - sealed it. clear when i closed the hatch.
huh? 03 17 44 57 lmm your ops is at 6800.
stand by.
"boy, you certainly aren't very loud."

"- - the other way, downslope with it, john."
"okay, jim. it's about time, at your convenience, for another volts and amps reading on the command module. for your information, we put 6 amp-hours back in the battery already and we've got about 14 to go. it's looking real good, and i also just got the word that the entry weather tomorrow is looking better all the time. really looks great."

okay; 55 and 323.
"america, houston. looking at the 02 pressures, we think maybe tank 3 isol valve got jarred closed. would you check the barber pole over on panel 278. if it's barber pole, would you reopen the valve? 03 10 23 o1 iamp gordy, we checked that. i'll check it again. we checked it right after the jet."
... about it first.
roger. very small.
"pete, you've been out 1 hour and 2 minutes, and you're both running about 2 minutes off nominal, behind."
"okay, tony. and is there any change in the mid- course 2 time, or is it going to be like the flight plan?"
mark cmp.
"okay; very good. what we're going to do, jim, is to drop the up-link and see what happens. and just to clarify the communications glitch that we had, the ground _tation lost the power amplifier, and we lost up-link to you. there was apparently no loss of down-link. so what we want to do now is to - is to drop the up-link and see if it creates the same glitches that - as you got on the ac bus that time. in view of your circuit breaker being out, we donlt think there's a connection, but we'd just like ta have this final confirmation. and - -"
that's what i said was we've got more black and white - -
"fred, in regards to the camera settings, for black-and-white 3400 film, the settings were f:5.6 at 1/250th. 0ve_."
"okay. one thing, joe; i just want to doubleeheck again. all the stuff that normally was going to start at 57 hours, which the first item was pres- surize csm to 5.7 psia, we're going to move that up to 64 now, so we have our lm entry which was nominally at 58 at 55. is that correct?"
this is apollo 1t. radio check.
okay.
okay.
"jack, stand by, until we get the high bit rate, on that battery management. and, a reminder, are you recharging that plss number 2 there, or have you taken that off the line? i_p-ln no, we're - we're through with that. we caught it with l0 minutes."
two people in the viewing room and that's more than is in the trench.
"america, houston. please advise us of how you are going to handle the waste stowage vent. is that open or you going to close it now?"

"and, if you can get the tv switch there, jack, that kind of saves - all that stuff, i guess."
"all they got is those drinks, charlie. orange drinks."
"okay, bob."
roger. copy.
so that meant that your refsmmat wasn't quite the refsmmat that you were anticipating earlier. _nd that explains the - why those angles had to change on you and also explains some of those odd-ball components.

"i'm going to torque those gimbal angles. 05 20 5b 05 cc torque them, babe, full stroke gimbal."
"okay, joe. i can find a position on the switch where i can turn the light out now - in neutral position on the switch, if you want to look at it. i've cycled the switch a number of times, and i think i've got the spot where the light will go off, and i'll turn it off for a couple of seconds here for you."
"get the visor down. holy smoly! think it'd be better to leave it up. beautiful out here today, bob. we can look to the east for a change - a little bit, anyway."
"no, this is the biggest crater right over here to the right."
"well, here_ i've been using this little goody bag and getting my stuff emptied out of it."

i'd say it's a dark gray. 03 l0 48 ll iaip there's something up here that's dark gray?
"okay, give us about 5 minutes here."
"how are those tv cables down there, charlie?"
"okay, we'll - we're not getting very many rocks by going this far, but if that's what you want, that's what you want. run, baby (laughter)."

have you got the tongs?
"i been trying, hank .... i don't know. that - that acquisition there wasn't as smooth as i thought it might be. i tried to get you using manual to tweak it up a little bit and that didn't seem to help much. maybe i'm not helping at all, maybe i'm hurting."

"you going to want me to put this in auto afterwards or not? #** turn around, jack."
"yeah. now, the only rocks we see are really angular, and they're on this rim. and i - i guess the problem is - it was a cratering event was probably so long ago. there's just no - not even a hint of any ledges or bedrock in this rascal."
"roger. (no co_ for 36 minutes) 05 10 01 18 cdr-i24 okay, charlie's charging his plss with water, and he just started 5 minutes about - 5 seconds ago."

"okay. 07 23 4h 31 cc - - you could use it for one final verification there, charlie, but we should have picked all those items. 07 23 44 39 ii,? okay."
"yeah, we can get a lot of rocks in a rake sample. charlie says the double core will go."
"hey, fellows, we're able to see the earth with your big eye there."
"yes, i don't think that's going to be any problem until we get up and look back. oh, man, what a trip this is going to be. golly."
...
that's outstanding.
"system a main sov, closed. how does it look to you?"
and you're hanging on =he end of the probe. we'll wait until motions damp here. okay. we seem real steady. i'm going to back off from you.
"yes, we're - looks like we're looking straight down on the center of south america, pretty close to what you're saying."
"that's affirmative, iow, ii'you'll make a little note there, go to 214 hours, page 323. 07 21 40 07 cmn go to - say again?"
"okay, fine. thank you."
we have done that -
okay. and now on the eva-2 prep cue card.
"roger_ how're you getting that, jack? are you looking with lllemonocular now? t_ that's affin0_ monocular still gives real good resolution on the cloud patterns. [,_usic] ns2_ed eye, you just see the masses_ but with the 10-power monocular, it's perfectly adequate for seeing the kind of patterns we're ta_lking about."
hope your pulse is lower than mine.
okay. still 5 by.
okay. and lmp's frame count is 35.
okay.
*** we changed it to a subfloor instead of a *** unit.
okay.
okay - -

no. don't want to get in your way here.
we have l0s at 198:45:37. about a little over 22 minutes from now.
*** but it wants to slide out. it's full. no rocks in it. it looks like just the same stuff we've been traveling through.
"roger. we're seeing it, fred."
okay. i'll do it. okay. now they want two strips around here to make a tight seal.
scs; hand controller's armed.
...
yes.
thank you. 05 11 58 0h lmp right there.
"okay, we're starting out late, as you know; but there's nothing aheadthat we can see that's time-critical. so you might try to hurry a little, but don't - don't go to any great lengths to try to catch up with the flight plan. we can slip the _ telemetry activation without any problem. over. okay, we got you. our biggest problem this morn- ing is keeping ron from going back to sleep."

"i'll lock it. i'll just push that latch- that latch is just sticking, that's all. it's just dust, i guess. i don't know what you do about those problems."
"must be a pretty steep slope here. man, look at tho_e angular blocks there, would you. around there. tony, here are 30 or 40 very angular blocks - 50 centimeters or so - and they have the same ch_'acter as the ones we sample bagged, so - apparently, a ray material."
okay. b simplex.
"okay, copy that. and did you guys get your bags fixed up there, jack? we were concerned about your scb for a while."
"the point where we're samplin_ is - just about in the center of three craters of almost equal size. i would say, perhaps, 20 meters in diameter. the ones to the north in *** are more fresh, more sharp; the one to the left is more subdued. i'm pretty sure we're just about where point a is on the map_ it fits *** well, it fits the description of it. 05 11 56 37 cd_ okay. in the tds_ houston; serial nur..ber10©2. 05 11 57 11 cd5 and the frame counter on the cioseup is no_ 335."

"roger. i've got 1 minute on my timer right now - about 01:27, actually."
"standby on that, ron. we'll give it to you in a minute."
roger. we got them.

there's old - what's the big crater down there? it looks like theophilus.
okay. how about getting it stretched out?

yes.
try not to get any surprises. i guess - no one's ever talked about them coming down.

okay .... me get s-band in ...
"hello, houston; endeavour."
set gpi to trim.
okay.
"roger, 17. we're ready for the vent valve to go closed. waste stowage vent to closed. and we have no anticipated changes, at the present time, in the flight plan, jack."
i have two of them.
"just check the needle on the peg here; 51 and a couple of minutes until we're down. 12 06 55 _0 lmp is that pausing from minimum impulse? 12 06 55 _5 cdr it sure is. man, that's just bang, bang. that's really neat."
locked.
"is it your camera, dave?"
"okay, i'm back in tunnel vent and i'm gonna bring my roll engines on, and you're clear to check your relief valve."
ready to go?
"thank you, jim."
so am i.
looks good to us. what is that?
six mags is it? we want this.
"okay, houston. you should have the high gain now."
stand by.
that's affirmative.
"houston, aquarius."
"casper, houston."
okay.
... on that total.
we've got to put these dumb - don't forget to put these lunar - -
"roger. i understand that. _ttreally looks like what i want to dc,is to make a radial burn, you behind me. i really ought to make a radial burn out, shouldn't i'.' 04 04 00 33 _ yeah. shouldn't he?"
...
... we got it a great big one.
600 feet to go.

can you reach it? watch it that that hatch don't fall shut.
lots of craters.
"okay. 302, suit flow is off."
okay.
"okay. stand by 1 more minute, jim."
"okay. i copy that. cdr-iai bob, the boulders - the boulders we are sampling - i thi_ jack and i both feel that it's probably - we feel we sampled the subfloor because we saw on the sides of the craters where some of these boulders were exposed _lmost as if they were bedrock down there. in driving back from what we called station l, we - we could definitely see the light mantle out in the area where the potentials of a slide are."
"that's wrong, dave."
okay. thank you.
that's affirmative.
start that whenever you want.
"- - ... century. you're doing - well, there must be somebody out there. 05 2b 40 40 lmp-eva bob, the fragment population - we're at 099, 2.0 - is still about the 1-percent category of - and it's hard to tell, going into the sun, what kind of blocks you're dealing with. but - my - my guess is most - well, more than a guess - most of them look like they're slightly vesicular. and, in that regard, resemble the gabbros."

"that's correct. now, turn back several pages to 3-54_ please. and that's the ""cycle film in pan and map cameras"" page - procedures page. 02 gl 35 58 lmp okay; i have it."
7. comp for roll.
hen_t?
"okay. 03 09 3b 53 cc it's not time critical to get this up to you. it's just that, before you get too far in assem- bling these on your own, we'd kind of like to give you the benefit of experience down here."
you sure that other cable won't work on that camera? the one for the el? q1 08 19 03 cmp no.
okay. i'll roll to 280.
that's clear. it's clear.
"go ahead, aquarius."
"hello, endeavour; this is houston."
do you want soil with that comprehensive?
one? okay.
"you just can't believe the ridges and valleys and ridge rilles, here. i tell you - the local slope might be 2 or 3 degrees, but, man, that double spot - whoever picked that place to land - it's the only level spot around here. any place else_ you'd really be in trouble."
okay. which headset is broken? the snoopy?
... okay.
"whoa, straight in. good, good. 06 20 0s 03 cdr-eva okay, bob. 226/3.6. there's a- there's a highly fragmental, small crater about _0 - 30 or _0 meters across, right on the southeastern rim of smp. and at - there's a - most of the frag- ments are football size and smaller, and they're very angular. and probably the inside of that rim is - -"
roger. i haven't been on all your revs. you ever had any - anything you'd call a visual on the i_?
prim 1. here it comes.
auto.
"15, this is houston, and we're all set up for the voice check."
"houston, how do you read the lmp?"
"well, it's stained by the glass coating."
throw it in the handtool carrier.
"okay, fine."
"it looks like we'll have to use that bag over again, though, because we only got two of them, and i expect that we'll have to make more than two of these canisters up."
"okay, henry. thank you, sir."
okay. you need to ask him anything? i'll try to high gain.
you're going to slow down in just a minute. fifteen seconds. l0 04 22 05 _ okay. standing by.
i'll verify both those.
"houston, aquarius."
"well, watch this real quick."
"*** hundred feet, 15 feet per second. *** high. h-dot's a little high."
"yes, there's one in my footpan, too. you see it there?"
i've got 3 pretty well spotted.
"... hey, i've learned something. let the suit do the work for you."
"yes, they're apt to break."
"jim, you'll be splashing down about 560 miles southeast of samoa at about 0800 local time. the weather forecast for the area is good_ ]500, scattered, high broken, 10-mile visibility. the seas will be 5-foot waves, 15 knots, and you'll _- going to _._o_ by boat ._.n._./.n.r..a._.r._.r_ft_ you'll spend either the night on the boat or in a and return to ellington by 141 on saturday, the following day."

locked. let me get it - i can get this other one.
"just a passing comment, joe. we're having lunch right now, and i just made myself a hotdog sandwich with catsup. very tasty and almost unheard of in the old days."
"houston, 1_. do you read now? 04 02 49 _9 cc 14, this is houston. roger. we are reading you about 5 by 4. over."
okay. fine. (laughing). it's okay.
waste water's 15.

it's sure gone - -
"okay. f 12 08 48 3j cc okay, ron. the switch has been made. you're ready - we're ready for the copy."

"houston, you ready for a good old e-memory dump?"
roger.
"yes, i know it."
"go ahead, bruce."
"that one right down there, where that block is."
"roger, ron. we can accept the noun 05."
"13, houston."
"roger. we'd sure like to come down there and see _, you folks .... too."
well -
here's your -
"how do you read, bob, on the high gain?"
"challenger, houston. we see you heading toward gimbal lock. over."
"hand me the flight plan, will you?"
not nothing left.
what are you doing?
"okay, i'll - we'll remember - -"
"i do. one thing i've noticed; it seems to compact into a very shiny surface. i guess the particles are very small and very cohesive, so when you - every bootprint, as you look at it, it looks almost like getting a piece of rubber itself. it's so well defined, and you can't see any grains in it or anything."
- - ...
"houston, 15."
"orion, this is houston. you can expect a roll moment offset due to the tg [?] change. we've had a loss of rcs system a. and then at 500 feet to go, when you open the main shutoff valve, yo_ can expect an rcs warning at that time; otherwise, it'll be nominal procedures during ascent."
"hello, houston. how you doing?"
"yes, i got to go around anyway."
"now, houston, do you want head crater - from triple craters? is that what you want or do you want the triple craters?"
houston - took who? 61 to 177
enter. can i do this?
"okay. cb eps panel 16, ascent eca control, close."
yes. i guess i didn't understand what the letter and the number was behind some of these photo targets.
"okay. go ahead, vance."
"say, we have to be careful. don't move sideways or backwards. you just don't know what's there. you've always got to move forwards."
"roger, gene. any comment you might make on the possibility of picking up your yaw, if you'd lost your platform at that time - remember the discus- sion we had about the yaw in the late - like a mode iv or something like that?"
deke wants you to go to bed.
houston. tranquility is going to put the track (tranq) modes in p00 now.
four seconds.
"well, i'm not sure it can. 06 00 42 04 cml° ..., pete, i don't see it."
roger. we're standing by.
okay_ charlie.
okay. my initial 02 recharge's complete and i got 95 percent.
did you take that - did you take that filter off the camera?
okay. two minutes. delta-v thrust - -
good night.

"on a lunar eclipse - let's see, we take a total there of -"
mine - mine was probably right up there.
"hey, outstanding. okay; good."
"one thing the world might be interested in knowing is what you do after the burn in the way of configuring switches back. we - we heard you go through the checklist. but, i guess right now, basically, you probably have all the switches back in position and you're in the mode to con- tinue on with - okay. what does the flight plans say? you're going to be doing cislunar naviga- tion. so, jack you're going to be down in the leb. is that correct?"
"okay, joe. and while you're doing that i've got a question about the command module checklist."
okay. and the battery management is at 164:45.

okay.

"bob, i've been at that 30-second count one other time and it's no different the second time around."
that's good.
"well, we had a burn yesterday."
okay. _
"okay, the - the electrolyte pads may be still ex- panding a little bit so i'm going off the air briefly to start getting into the suit. and i'll talk to you in a little while."
okay?
"stand by 1, fred."
"houston, did you get our last comment?"
okay. a bestow:bullialdus; i'll _c te -u.6.
wait a minute. circuit breaker (16) ecs: cabin repress to close.
roger. i hope we're not going to let the air out.
"we can see the solar wind there, joe, and looks like it 's blowing."
"okay, jack. here come the abort constants. 224 is - 6 - -"
"you're in dump, huh?"
okay; give me 208.
"just like in the simulator. yes, i think that's pretty good. 1-34 day 5"
okay. we copy that. you may bear back to the right about l0 degrees.
"... cm_ oh, it fits !"
"yes, that's - -"
"then that's really what we'd do, you watch."
verified.
yes.
"roger, 15. understand you're ready for the update. tell a1 that was another super set of arcs, certainly."
"well, i'm a little behind on - -"
"allo, terre. salute de l'endeavour."
yes. 05 23 42 47 l_ sticking on the windows.
"roger. we're planning on doing that. i was just (tranq) wondering how much longer we want to wait, though. we've probably got s_lother half an hour's worth of picture taking, and i guess we could run through an eat cycle and then change the canister, and then depress. over."
"okay. does it look to you like it just has a bias on it? 01 05 59 1_5 cc roger, 11. it does seem to be a bias. looks like it has a fairly high threshold before it starts indicating. eecomm seems to thjmk, though, that for high flow rate purposes, it w_ll still give you a relative indication during the mission. over. 0! 06 00 _lo cdr okay. we understand. thank you."
"let me get the cameras squared away here first, okay?"
mark it.
"okay, i want to switch to window 3. a little better to try and get the pictures."
"now, pete, that's some good thinking. yes, sir; i'_regot it at 202:20."
"houston, 15."
"yep. i don't think - no, it won't push anymore than that. see, it won't ride up over this thing here. we'll do it whenever we get there."
just pick anything in the picture for scale. - -
roger. and go wide on the high gain.
okay. verify flow and cuff gage reads 3.7 to 4.0. ron? cml° okay. i got 3.9 on the cuff gage.
approximately. seventeen; okay.
"oh, yes, sorry."
"okay, 16. how do you read now?"
looks like we'll be ready to go into the lm early if that's okay with you all down there.
... you watching me?
"it doesn't rap off; it just - 05 11 40 39 lb_ okay, ready to transfer etb when you are."
"good; mine, too."
okay. i've got lots of pages here of ken's _q_oto log set to go.
yes.
where is the what?
"oh, you just kicked a snowstorm of dust across here."
"okay, els logic, on."
"rot power direct, two, off. o1 06 41 49 cml° two off."
that's affirmative; 2 feet a second.
you might put - what are you going to put the big rock in? that might go in the scb.
"hey, we have a bunch of questions we'd like to ask. but we're going to knock it off and let you get some sleep and we'll try to pick your mind when you get home here. but there's one thing in the rover there. on the drive from station 10 back to the lm, did you notice that the nav base - the nav system worked? whether you got any distance on there in particular?"
i think we've made up 45 minutes on our late wakeup - hour late wakeup this morning.
okay.
can you hand me another baggy?
that's affirm. that's the reason.
"and, john and charlie are up there, now. they're at cinco."
"whoo, man! is it dumping! whee!"
"hey, john, do you - did you do that secondary leak?"
"roger. delete ""pugs, balanced."""
"oh, boy. okay. the - we're back into the mantle area population of fragments is still i percent or so. the crater off to our left, which is at 227 and 3. - what is that?"
you could send that down with the evening report.
"are you shooting pretty much straight down or out in front, on this one?"
"go ahead, ron. apoi_o 17 air-t0-ground voice transcription 06 22 29 02 c_dr-eva ail right."
are y'all getting it real time?
"okay, good show."
"okay, ron; stand by, please."
(coughing)
yes. not much.
"okay. we're getting data from you, jack, so that much looks good. on panel 5, request verification that eps sensor signal circuit breaker is main b. over."
"plus lll. okay. burn's complete, stu. okay, put me back on the checklist now. 05 23 01 22 l_[p okay. ga to p00."
"okay, houston. how are you doing?"
"challenger, houston. we're - we've looked at the lm data and it looks perfect, no problems at all. what we're doing right now, though, is - is - the checkout on the carrier and subcarrier lockups on the l_ comm. so far, we've had no trouble with it, but we haven't quite completed the routine we wanted to try. over. i_p okay. i understand, gordy. no - no hurry here. 02 12 25 3_ cc okay, jack. we've completed our investigation of the corem,there. it all looked good. you can press on page 2-4."

"pressure flag, and i still got an 02 flag."
"okay, do you want to - do you want to trim?"
"repress, off."
stand by please.
roger. copy. tape l&0/ll
"okay, you've got p00 and data. okay, we're off hot mike now."
"yes, we've enjoyed it."
"okeydoke, endeavour. on page 2 - 283 -"
right.
gnomon is on the rover. the tge is on the rover.
"yes, that's going to be - oh, is it heavy. *** heavy. something in that core tube you put in there?"
*** do. okay ....... ?
okay.
okay.
we'll give you real-time updates on that.
roger.
"yes, we see that."
okay.
"okay, are you ready pdi? 04 00 _3 00 lmp-lm go ahead with the pdi pad."
"15, houston. request you trim back to the original attitude now."
*** (eagle )
very good.
"_ld, tony, the only - on that - on the rocks, back to one other little point, there. that - you know, we called the whitish rocks tuff breccias- i mean, shocked rocks. but we're eou - at least, i'm per- sonally convinced that there are at least two endogenic craters that we passed, and - the big one on the way to north ray and the big one coming back from - from stop 8. and so, that might have been a source of a tuff - if that's what they turn out to be."
"okay, and the white rock that you picked up and the ones you just have here, can you see any crystals in it? 06 01 29 40 i_mp-eva yes, sir. i sure can. it's a bluish crystal, a couple of millimeters size."
verified.
come around behind my shoulder. 4-6 _'//_ oay 6
"okay, out to the side there - a little arrow, i guess, is the best way to indicate it - in other words, between ""rate, high"" and ""ems, normal,"" we want to say ""terminate emp 509."""
i'd like to sort of tack. i can see a lot better. just a little north or a little south.
"somebody new serving coffee, huh?"
"that's right. take it easy. ail in good time. 07 04 24 23 _ _.. see here, i'm going to - -"
let me have that dadgum - did you get mine?
i don't want to look.
okay. put it - get your foot down on that thing again.
"no, i'll get it. why don't you get your 500, and i'll - -"
okay. glad to hear it.
"okay, jim, we're copying."
"well, let me climb up here .... 00 00 50 3h cdr oh, i'm sorry. okay. it's - it's good."
"mark. gravity .... okay; now let me get to work. - okay .... my fender got a little kinked here, which isn't going to help us ... f cc hey, jack. and we see your gold visor is up. you may want to put it down out here in the sun."
"put in - input yet? okay, go - pitch down then. yeah. okay, up should be in the right direction on this thing. i said up the first time and that - that looked like it went the wrong way. oh, okay; well, you need to go up about 3 degrees then."
...
"endeavour, this is houston. the surgeon reports that we have good respiratory data from your biomed volunteer, but we have evidence that one of the three ekg leads is open-circuited, either not attached or broken somewhere. and, sometime over the next few hours, we'd like - we'd like you to troubleshoot this for us, please; and, if need be, there is an extra biomed harness in the medicine kit. over."
"right. oh 14 48 13 cdr iiouston, aquarius. 04 ih 48 16 cc go ahoad."
roger.
"okay. 06 02 25 58 imp-eva the dac is on, and now watch this big leap. oh, oh - can't leap. i'm hooked onto something."
there's a real fresh one just down-sun from here.
"what 's that, bob?"
roger. beautiful.
"... we're down around between, w_iz a?ound f:ll, which we thought would be plenty light. wel! , we'll lighten it up some more."
"okay, copy that. okay, and can you amplify your description going out to station 6. in particular were there blue-gray and tan-gray bands on the north massif?"
okay. stand by 1.
no. 180 is the meridian is at 162:38.
"okay. when you come up on aos on the nex_ rev s rev 15, we'll give you a go or no go for another try, and we'd be looking at pdi on rev 16, and at that time, we'd have pads for you and proce- dures. over."
"are you picking it up, houston?"
roger. we show you at about 27 degrees longitude right now.
hight. i understand. 0b 02 17 06 cc - - should not correspond with noun 22.
"okay, jack. offhand, i can't imagine that since we got the platform powered down why we'd need to worry about the instantaneous control. but at any rate, we need 15-minutes warmup with the heaters before we can start using thrusters. 03 ]0 51 54 cc right. and another thing we've done is to pull your ecs and epc display breakers and so - but we left your caution and warning powered up. so if you get ecs-type or eps caution and warning you'll have to power up those meters with the display breakers. and we are watching for you your pipa temperatures, your asa temp, your propellant temperatures except for the dps pro- pellant, and we're watching your quad temps for you."
- - where are the reflections? i've been fooled once. there is orange soil!
"for a minute there i was worried. okay. i can stab it into the ground about - okay, are you guys ready? here we go."
you want me to take that one?
"okay, houston. that's complete."
"okay. that sounds good, charlie. 05 08 ]l 30 cdr-i_m yeah, i believe charlie - i think charlie's right about that."
i've got it.
roger. out.
"okay, mesa blankets are tidied. okay. open tge - i'll do that. brush to ladder hook. final transfer, jack. i'm going to - okay, i'll tell you what i'm going to do. you've got the - i'm going to - i'm going to inventory here. you got the pallet. etb is here, and you got the core- stem bag. sr - scb-2 is there; src-1 is here; big bag is not required. bob, i think we got everything. the two things on the surface yet are the etb and the src and me."
"ken, i think they are. but i think you'll find that the ones in station 6 are much more metamorphic rock, or recrystallized rock, than the ones we had at station 2. i had the impression that the ones we were sampling at station 6 were - were really inclusions in the - anorthositic gabbro - and had - had been probably considerably meta- morphosed by it being included in it; whereas, the ones we had at station 2 were a separate rock type apparently, as i recall it, anyway."
and the doors are closed and locked.
"oh, okay."
"okay, jack. we've got a master ala_ and we've got a battery light flickering."
"we've still got a lm update, but we strongly recommend that you _d jack work as hard as you can sleeping for about the next 5 hours. fred can handle it. 05 08 _6 42 cdr okay. that's what we']l do. we'll put fred on watch here, and jack and i will take it easy, and if fred copies the lm update, well, then we'll all start from fresh in the morning. 05 ()8/6 56 cc you bet."
"okay, let me get one more, charlie."
"yeah, it's done."
try that one.
"okay, bob, there's a big spall lying on the ground here that has been knocked off up there, from right on top of the boulder. and, i tell you, the more i look at this - the south half of this boulder, the more heterogeneous in texture it looks. it looks as if it may be *** recrystallized breccia of some kind_ or you had a gabbroic anorthosite - ma_ma catch up s_nawi_l lot of inclusions. i guess i prefer the latter explanation because of the extreme vesicularity of the rock."
"okay, tony. you got a good view of north ray here, and as we look - as i look at it, there's a - a north-south - northeast-southwest line of boulders that come out from the southwest rim and go up the northeast rim out smoky mountain."
"okay, joe. jim and a1 are doing some housekeeping now, and we're going to make sure we get all the exercise periods for you."
roger.
"okay. remind me of that, will you."
"here's your tongs. would you pick up my bag and let me move down and get a little bit stereo, and i'll be right with you."
"okay. copy that, fred. thank you very much; 38.9 and 1.9. and eecom is simply making as smooth a plot as he can to verify the amount of amps we're putting back into the battery. that's why he wants it at half-hour intervals. if that schedule begins to interfere seriously with your rest cycle or so, give us a call. over."
"how about both of them? 09 03 38 46 imp no, i can't reach - -"
"okay, how about a little squirt? man, this lcg pump cooling is the best thing they ever built."
... out?
..
that would be an honor.
"okay, tony, we're doing l0 clicks."
"(laughter) i'm not, huh?"
"bob, my down-sun pictures on the rake were taken at f/8. i'm sorry."
looks great.
it wasn't - it wasn't before.
we have one mark. now doing 40.
that's affirmative.
"you want this all over there, dave?"
"okay, i have a - a question here, charlie, but then, on the next line, it's - under neck ring, they said add ""stow commander's purge valve"" - oh, that's ""serial number 194 in isa bottom pocket."""
"okay, gordo. we're in attitude now."
"stand by a second, ken."
"roger, al. and - the provision on that is that you be at burn attitude before you dump the water. and after the sextant star check."
"yes. you're right. hope it is. i'll tell you what you never did. you never gave me a verb 83. if you ever can do it, it should be nice."
roger.
i know it.
"no, it was grinning at me. that's why i stopped."
"i think you're right. 600, 700 feet."
"john, this is houston. if - if there is nothing startling to report about the ride, we'd rather hold off. we're watching - we're evaluating a need for a possible iu nam update, and also we're seeing some pressure - overpressure in aps module number 2. we'll give you a full story on that over honeysuckle. 00 o0 56 _l cdr okay, i - no, there's nothing really spectacularly different to report on the ride. we'll hold off on that."
"okay, coming up on 03:30."
"roger, dave. and whe - when you hold it together, we can read him loud and clear, so that's the yroblem. i g_ess we need a tape job on that antenna. jr confidei',t'tili 6"
"roger. you're in po0 and accept, no midcourse 3, and we're all set for a state vector update and i'm giving you the lm/cm delta-p here shortly."
you got it for 2 seconds.
roger.
"okay, joe. 05 0h 27 34 cdr-eva i can't steer."
"well, i don't know about that. also, since tomor- row's pretty relaxed, we encourage you to get a lot of sleep tonight. you've got - you've got plenty of time; no need to feel like you've got to press in the morning. tape8""/_ 05 08 19 30 cdr-ii4 okay, and i think i've got a ph factor going for about 3 right now."
"none. jim, it's stuck on minus 12."
"okay. and we'd like the ir, off."
"okay, here's that little tilt. hang on. easy does it. okay."
"okay. wait a rain - hold it, america - challenger. _- the hot fire - you want free, challenger?"
"let's see, joe. we still have bag 2 - on the right side of the handtool carrier. should i -- put it temporarily under my seat?"
"copy that, gene. _$_ank you."
roger. it was reading 33 on my mark. right?
"if your watch is reset, we'll flip the page."
did you see anything that you were pretty confident was igneous?
stand by.
"yes, there are - let's see l, 2, 3, 4 - at least f 4 lined up going upslope."
you want me to -
set 007.
okay.
"he's turning his lights off now, too."
okay; go ahead.
"yes, casper. this is houston. you should null the line-of-sight rates."
"okay; we're just going to back out of that pro- cedure. let's go track mode, off."
we're there. that's right. it's all hanging out from there on.
"that's affirmative, jack."
"yes, i think you're right."
they're auto.
ticonderoga; roger.
"boy, bob, that sure is a good thought. you know, i had to take the treadle off because the jack wouldn't go down and no way i could put that treadle - well, let me turn it on first. that was a good thought. it may - it may go down that hole. that would be terrible."
okay. fine.
- - on me.
*** it.
"casper, would you verify that you are gonna load the - the dap and then the emi° 509 before you do the p527"
"okay, we'll take the big bag. i hope we can keep it on."

"no, i don't need it. we have to go to coffee in a minute."
"right, you have two hedc mags, b and d; three hedc mags, a, c, and h; one 500-millimeter mag l; three dac mags, p, q, and r; your maps; and six sample contingency bags - or containment hags."
"oh, go ahead. we'll listen, ed. we're just changing out the batteries and stuff for the plss."

can you bend over a tad?
roger. you get - -
why don't you turn these up?
"okay. and i've got gray on the mapping camera, extend, and that was at 1 minute and 20 seconds."
there is a definite bright spot up on the side of the hill - it's almost an extension of that slide area from shorty.
... give you guys an opportunity to look.

good.
no.
"i just hope we find the old snowmanl then, i hope we find a place to land; then, i hope i can set it down all right!"

"and, houston, we - okay, we have engine thrust and commanded thrust, full-scale high."
okay.
says circuit breaker pitch 2 - -
"okay. hadley base, houston. we got your e-mod. we're ready to give you an uplink if we can have po0 and data."
"yeah. in fact, tony, the whole area - there's a lot of this rock - there's a lot of this rock here, scattered all over - scattered around."
it looks pretty great.
okay.
"okay. 00 03 03 5_ cmp i'll take my accel command; pitch up - in l0 seconds, i'll pitch up, making sure this needle's positive."
"okay, bob. let's see, you got your readings - -"

yes.
"hey, i think i shorted someone a lemon pudding. a lemon pudding."
"north of index, huh?"
i think part of our problem is - is this - slope. there's no purchase - as m_ father used to say - no purchase.
"roger. 02 ll 20 34 cml° okay, tony. i guess i'm ready to give you a film status report."
"yes, i agreed. cdr-_4 as far as - as far as how much of the new fender to overlap on the present fender, just make it about symmetrical with the other side, and that probably ought to give me plenty of overlap, huh?"
"houston, aquarius."
i thought - -
"boy, mine's different than yours."
"now, if the old antenna would come back in, we'd be in good shape, huh?"
"okay, tony. i've got the magazine from the -"
slew fdai?
"nope, we don't."

"well, let me give you a hand. we need any a - we don't need any -"
"just throw it in there, i'll find the ball."
okay.
mighty fine.
okay. any particular attitude you would like the pgns in when we do that?
are you going ... from here?

"okay, the doors are coming open. okay."
"hey, tony, one final comment. we've been talking about that crater that we took a pan of as we spun around and - gosh, it - i said, looked like big sag. john and i are leaning towards endogenis on that, and hopefully from the films that we got you might be able to sort that out. 06 t0 22 58 cc okay. we'll sure take that in consideration. i don't know whether it'll affect tomorrow, but - but i think it's a good obser - observation. we'll see you."

no.
"bob, i've had an impression, and i can't prove it yet, that we're dealing with more heterogeneous rock. possibly there are breccias in here. but it's - it's - awfully hard to tell right now. they're very light-colored rocks - i think even lighter colored than the gabbros."

yeah.
"he's still analyzing them, huh?"
copy.
"verify fan, off; pump, off."
"passing over - sulpic - and - i'm just passing over sulpicius gallus, now. and just beyond sulpicius gallus - sulpicius gallus is out in the mare tranquillitatis, itself, and it looks like you could - it's either a talus slope - you know, you got a gentle slope of the - of the massif coming down and then it changes slope a little bit, and the - it looks like you have finer-grained material. and that might be what we have at one time or another called the high-water mark, but i kind of believe that's just a talus change in the slope, as you.go on down there in the fine-grained material, somehow developing down there in the bottom. but as soon as you cross that area - we're going west now from sulpicius gallus - again we've got kind of the same tannish - a dark tan material that essentially covers the highland - this highland-type of an area here. it's a hummocky- type material. there are a few rilles just north of sulpicius gallus; those rilles, again, have - have the dark tan material on it. about the same as the tan - same color tones that you pick up from tacquet to mele - meleneis [sic]."
"okay. and then i have an update to your contingency checklist, page 4-3 which pertains to loi burn rubles, if you can get that out."
yes.
"waste water's off, huh?"
okay.
"ed, i donmt see any craters right: there. 35 12 31 29 _p kind of small."
you reset your ball? 05 22 37 40 t_mp i haven't reset it....
dsmm itz 04 19 31 10 i_ there it goes again. 0_ 19 31 13 cdr i should have lifted it up with one hand and then put it do_n. 04 19 31 20 ly_ lift it up and do what?
what?
"yes, that's some big fellow, isn't it? 05 02 09 03 irp-eva yes, it sure is. i don't know - -"
oh! blew itl
"ii , houston. recommend negative on that. that w_ll put us in low bit rate. 08 03 02 12 i24p 0k_y. i already put it to command reset, but i _till have barber pole on the tape. ant now my switch is high bit ra_e."
i did it. okay; helmet and gloves are off.
"dave, we mean are they off now. did they fall away from the unit when you picked the unit up. it's of - of relative unimportance, really, but it would be an interesting data point."
"where's the pad? ... you have to check on them in 1 minute, you guys. _ day 8 page 379"
okay.
"did you work all night through, tony?"
roger. we read loud and clear.
...
and we're getting a good view of the track lead- ing into the landing site now and -
"i hate to tell you this, you guys. john's got to go potty."
roger. 0.9.
"well, i don't know."
"okay, there's 1 minute. 05 03 o0 10 cr5° ... seconds to go, ... seconds ... exposure ..."
*** started. e
"13, houston. the booster reports that everything looks good with the s-iv."
"roger. _-- 03 02 51 40 lmp and i'm ready to copy the preliminary pad, joe."
i agree.
just check - check that antenna; make sure it's level.
"you can - al, you can place the leva bags on the floor, right side and forwards."
"good, good."
"yes, sir. suit fix)won both of them."
"that's what you guys were sampling at station 4, i bet."
okay. that's - that looks like where it's probably leaking.
yes. (jonfid
i'vs got it.
okay. joe s we are omni charlie. we have little bit better signal strength on another 0mni.
"roger; copied. on torquing angles, minus 060, plus 0.139, and minus 0.018 at 96:58:40. 04 01 04 30 _p that's roger. the ags checkout has gone well."
"well, i think that'll stay down, but it's not very good - -"
say a_ain?
"roger. understand, and i hope you have that pro- cedure for attitude."
"oh, my golly."
"okay. we'll proceed. 05 13 1,431 cc roger. 05 13 1,435 lmp i know where the star is; i'm not sure the pgns (tranq) knows where gravity is."
okay; three photo ...
okay.
"hey, pete, i've preioaded this - this - probe now. can you take another quick check at the docking latches?"
"let me go take a look at that. wait. oh, gosh, let's get dressed up here first."
"e-mod complete, 16."
we been riding with this thing off?
wanted to just remind you.
"that's correct. and on the same page 2-1, strike out the last three lin_s, starting with ""rcs transfer to service modmle."""
okay.
"15, this is houston. we're anxious to know down here if you have checked the lm/cm delta-p."
"roger, joe; copy. plane change plus 2 sps/g&n; 66313, p_us 1.23, minus 0.12; 080:29:13.47; plus 3189.4, minus 2437.0, minus 1356.5; 175, 079, 332; no ullage; and that burn equals sps docked."
"houston, apollo ll. i've been holdin_ here in scs control minimum deadband rate low with the limit cycle on, just as a matter of curiosity, if you guys wanted some fuel numbers from that."
okay. i'm opening up engine start override right now. and that row's taken care of.
do you know what keyhole looks like? geez. that's the kind of thing that would be good to explore.
"endeavour, houston. if you read, go omni charlie."
"now in a few minutes, vance, i guess we'll see how about the only system we haven't used yet works. everything else sure has worked mighty fine."
(singing) apollo 17 air-to-ground voice transcription
mark. t-2.
like you felt like you'd always been there.
okay.
"okay. did you have any trouble controlling the vehicle, and what techniques did you use?"
... go for pyro arm.
"okay. we're thinking you might have, on the way to the geology stops, driven between a couple of the trident craters then."
"fred, houston. the cohm isn't too sharp and i did_ 't copy."
yes.
what a big pile of - -
"11, houston. it looks like we'll have to think a little more about that, as to whether it's a i_-off or some effect of being out of lunar orbit. we don't know, so we'll have to puzzle before we can give a better answer."
roger. stand by one. (columbia)
"tell you what, if you want to even them up, we can crossfeed during this burn."
"... we're gonna have to move out. 06 02 23 37 i_p-eva ... plage, wouldn't you say? okay."
"okay. and close the isol valve, keep your tca breakers closed, close the crossfeed, open the next two displays. close the main sov and the propulsion breakers should all three be open."
"tranquility, this is""houston. yes, indeed. it's been a mighty fine presentation there."
that's affirmative. 02 19 58 21 cml° you want me to - to delete that from minus 20?
okay.
"oh, okay. 00 on the amps, of course; the battery temps, ll2 and ll9; and motor temps are still off scale low."
that's excellent. l0 02 09 lb cdr you should have a picture of a man in space.
"hey! did you see the way i handled the hammer, huh?"
"yes, man."
okay.
"houston, tranquility. we're ready to start with (tranq) the electrical checkout. we're going to s-band modulate fm. over. oh 12 01 14 cc roger. tranquility, this is houston. we copy. go ahead with the fm. and we missed the mark at 108. do you want us to try and give you one at 108 05? over."
okay. it sounds to me like i'm keying the - i'll try to talk a little louder.
"okay, that connector is made, somehow. and - -"
"all right, i sure will. l0 seconds. b, 2, i -"
roger; we got them. you can go ahead and torque them.
okay. that's a good readback.
"okay. we had the rendezvous radar in slew during (tranq) descent, though."
i'm not going to hook on to anything up there. i'm going to stand there and wait on you.
"yes, not the - not the ball, it's just the cdc."
"that's a good one because it puts the earth out window 1 and the moon out window 3 and puts the sun down in the leb, so the lighting in here remains relatively constant."
"and, dave, could you give - -"
"yeah, i can't do it - anything till i get that in."
"yeah, i can see it."
"oh, maybe that's still - i'd swear the general impression i have of this back side is that it has a much harder surface on it. and i don't really know why. i'm looking now at - i think i'm looking at green. and on the northern end of it - north - again we see a lot of material that seems to be striations and streaks that go down over the sides. there's slightly different albedos. almost everything up here is just a subtle tone of albedo change. but everywhere you see an albedo change, there is, in fact, a nice demarcation that goes with it. and i'm going to get one here that's on the crater rim."
"okay, we got tico. and the prime recovery ship - prime chopper - is recovery. the backup is swim, and we've got rescue 1 samoa, downrange."
"i think we got enough ullage in there, in the tanks to -"
okay.
*** hundred; 46.
those guys will die (laughter). they're down there - -
you might note that - hey -
could you cut - no. okay. okay.
"15, houston. _"
okay.
"yes, sir; let's go ahead. i'm ready. 0b 22 46 07 cc okay. the target is 16-3. ti, 096:43:59, 096:45:37.0, 096:46:07, 096:46:29. attitude, 015, 296, 000; north, 03 nautical miles."
"okay. can you see the docking target, and do you have a grid? i've got a grid on my monitor that you should be able to correlate with. do you have that available? if you don't, i'll just try to talk you in towards the frame."
beautiful.
z is not important.
"we're coming right along, tony."
"you and me both. 0}ij2 59 04 cc it's going through 50 pounds now. f:o,are you seeing fewer sparklies?"
okay.
"okay. well, i'll thrust plus-x, four jets then, when you give me a contact. 05 22 36 07 c_ okay."
no. 00 04 32 3a cdr no. no latch.
you bas - you cr_mmy thing.
"roger. and, dave and jim, one last comment which we're - we're pretty sure you're aware of. we - we think we 're looking at an eva tomorrow that 'll run about 6 and a half hours, about the same thing we did today. and we do have a few miscellaneous items to clean up, either - most likely at the end of the traverse, so it's liable to be a little shorter distancewise, but otherwise, other than that, it'll be more or less unchanged. over."
that's the one i'm going for. did you get the after?
"... we are - we're reconfiguring now. okay. 09 ii 44 43 cc america, kousvon. ?/edidm't see the mapping camera go off. did you get that one off?"
"descartes, 163:29:12."
"that'll be done tomorrow, ken. what we'd really like for you to do is get to - get to resting. go into your sleep period just as soon as you can here."
no. i get the exercise. in just doesn't amount to anything.
little ones here. and 278.
"okay. what page is the, do we write the gyro torquing angles on there, jack?"
mark.
0_366. 07 03 30 58 _ right. !confidenti
"well, we're getting a little close to the te._mi- nator. change to 5.6, jack, i don't know. no, maybe not. 22_p we're looking down zero phase. c},°5 _r_at's right, it's almost zero phase, okay. see. zt's just beyond that, i changed to f/4."
*** lot of static now? i_mp-eva yes.
"eey, ... you're in mine. 07 l0 18 21 c_p yeah. 07 10 18 22 i/_p it's already in there. bet you 5 dollars."
"just, fine. waiting for you guys to go to sleep so we can do the same. had a great da_ up there, guys. cdr-ir oh, you don't have to wait for that. we're - it was super from here - it's quite an experience, deke, and quite a chal1enge."
okay.
everybody's happy with it down there?
"al, the medics told me that they can see that you are exercising per the flight plan. would you like to know what peak value you get? peak value on heart rate, that is."
"no. okay. the one that we did in flight - yes, i had - i had a lot of bubbles, but i couldn't get mine - krytox out across the center. so, you all are already well ahead of what i did."
... - -
"no, sir. we had good signal strength. it wasn't peaked for the high gain. it was more like an omni signal strength, about 70 percent. and we called you several times after the switch in lines, and then finally you came through clear, but with some background noise and sounded like vhf. i presume it wasn't, now. and when you called, i went to omni alfa, with no change in signal strength, still about 70 percent, and you were still coming up the same way and apparently didn't hear us. and then the high gain - with high gain acquisition, it's been pretty clear."
jim had tossed the penetrometer -
okay - -
"okay, omni charlie."
"okay, anything i need to write down?"
okay.
okay. looks like it's holding. (eagle)
"okay, about 58:45."
"okay, position mikes."
"here, hold this for me."
"hey, you know, there's a lot of bad landing places _- around here. that old sun angle, i think, shows most of them up. bob, i - -"
your gamma ray deploy time to 15 inches is 14 seconds.
"roger; we copied. and, dave, when you finish this, we'd like you to move back towards the rover."
hoo.
"manual, wide."
"endeavour, houston. did you say standing by?"
okay. i'm going ... clockwise here to mate the beast.
"well, bob, i don't know. it's hard - hard to follow that that's where we are. i'm not sure. it doesn't look like what i expected steno to look like - - lmp-e_ no, me neither."
"but he said it was over the relief pressure, didn't - already, didn't he? 00 g1 18 47 cdr something like that - -"
"oh, man, i tell you, with a stiff suit - still at 4.5. but, i am out here on the porch. lm_-lm okay."
i've got lots of oxygen.
...
"ali_rigat, casper, after you turn the mapping camera to the standby mode, we want you to add pan camera self test to heaters. 02 04 oh 11 cmp okay, you've got heaters now. and we're in st_ndby, and i'm about to turn the sm/ac power off unless you want me to hold it. 02 oh 04 18 cc leave it on, casper. leave that power on."
will do.
roger. it's in normal.
okay.
something you're not likely to forget for a while.
"next page, 26."
"okay. 05 01 29 07 ia_p-lm primary water, closed. forward hatch - turn that water off. cdr-i24 do you have to turn the primaries or just the secondary, bob?"
"we couldn't find it after we cleaned out - after we cleaned out that locker to stow the mapping c_nera cassette, the peanut butter mysteriously v_ished."
"okay, verify your trim: plus 1.45 - minus 66."
okay? unlatch. unlatch. ready? roger. _ 10 02 04 19 _ no.
"hey, houston."
"and i think we got them all. okay, gordo. understand."
get this bag off me to start. ia{p-eva get that bag off you to start with.
"that's what bothers me. that's what i'm saying. if it's still out there, it better be 1. okay. i'll give you a countdown on this one here. 5, 4, 3, 2, i-"
"roger. it's - the purpose, v71; get 11:45:00; index 21, 01501, 00001, 71465, 41437, 76654, 45425, 77003, 52553, 72602, 54007, 75455, 55217, 76267, 55324, 00402, 05560, and that's all."
turn around.
roger.
"ooh, look at that - ooh, ohx look at that one. it had - it almost looked like pahoehoe, didn't it?"
"well, that's wrapped in - if you can put it - if you put it end down, it may stay in the bag."
99.5. 00 01 55 07 c_ got it.
"okay. vacuum bag here. butch_ from the sounds of things, those guys are pretty dirty down there. probably need that extra bag."
don't find a fresher one?
that old probe is really nice.
"16, eouston. when you changed the lithium hydroxide canister, we noted a small drop in the suit com- pressor delta-p down here. did you change any of the configuration in the suit loop at the time you did that?"
"roger. it looks that way to us, charlie. 04 04 09 06 _ okay."
copy that.
"hey, dick, that was really a super burn."
okay.
never seen it fail.
"air=erica,houston. we're ready with all the updates, _oth verbal and elec=ronic, whenever you are."
"11, houston. a little information to you there, cdr. we've all taken a momentary brief respite from out work here to have some special - to have a bite of special moon cheese that is - i understand it's been sent to us directly from wapakoneta, your own hometown. over."
"sep temperature is 103 degrees; 103, and the mirror is still clean."
"we might also check the lmp's camera. cdr-_¢a okay. i'll give it to you again. lmp-_a that's fixed. oh, you mean for pictures?"
"okay, ... - - 00 03 24 o1 cml° hey, when that thing's lined up, it's one bar width - the target is one bar - -"
that - -
"wait a minute. here, i'll hand you this one; the other one, too. 06 21 59 54 i_mp-eva oh, okay."
mag charlie?
"okay, fine."
"good question. let me ask on that one. yesterday you were running at 1045 and 1090. so you're down considerably from your work rates of yester- day, which is good news. maybe you're learning how to do it more easily or something like that."
"stand by a second, charlie. okay, it's looking pretty good. don't have a picture here in the room yet, but we're getting data."
"scratch the whole ""pgns self-test"" section there, steps 1 through 5."
"okay, tony. this one is a- same spot - is a breccia with a white matrix - is glass coated on one side and then typical glass - lunar-surface glass coating. 05 03 _7 59 cc okay, we copy that. and when you're through with this site, you can press on around plum if you like."
"okay; let me *** tape out. see if i can't do *** 05 21 41 50 l_ ° *** a taping operation this morning. 05 21 41 5_ cc roger, jim. and we're reading you 5 by, babe, when - when that thing's connected. sounds like that's the problem. 05 21 42 02 i_ip yes, no doubt. 05 21 42 ©2 cdr okay. okay. just stana there now. yes, i know it, but i don't know how we're going to do -hat, because it's -"
"okay, ops, connect. suit isolation to suit discon- nect. and disconnect the lm 02 hoses and secure about the pga. 04 23 15 12 l_ okay, let's take those one at a time."
okay. 72:65 get.
that's affirmative.
... that thing is maneuvering in attitude a little bit. i don't think i'm closing ...
"okay, pressure's com- pressure's up; fuel pressure is stable at 175 and oxidizer at 175, and the light is out. and we're back to normal on caution and warning. and the valve now is back to auto."
roger.
right.
"power cable in the vacuum bag. ah, there's old vacuum bag."
"houston, endeavour. roger; understand. and wonder if you just got that last piece on the tv there. it was a piece of gray tape with some glass on it that came out of the tape meter."
roger.
yes.
got you some lunar dust.
"well, thank you very much, sir."
"i see where you've got ... coming up pretty soon, gene."
look at - that's - -
"listen, you - -"
... pull the whole thing over.
"well, one of us get on one side -"
"say that again, jack. i missed that. 0.6 on system test 7a?"
a 7-foot cross-sun to the south.
watch it. there you go.
"yes, if he'd fit through that little hole in the end of his wrist. i24p-lm joe, the day they can pour me out of anything, they'll call me slim. talk to you later."
"okay, i was thinking - okay, that's good. 06 03 17 ih cdr-eva ah, shoot. look at that."
okay.
"look at those linear features on hadley, dave, if you get a chance - -"

okay. have you got enough look now?
"roger; 274:05, we'd like to delete the mass spec line, where you turn on multiplier, low, et cetera. we'll delete that."
that's correct. it's over in the left-hand column.
"one more minute, pete ...."
okay. step 21 deleted.
"roger. in work. would you believe, it came on!"
okay. i was just curious as to how much time we've got out of these two cartridges.
"okay,"
"understand. at 247:30, you want to add ""mass spec multiplier, high, and discriminator, low."""
very true.
"good. make a right turn here. and i'll come back across, and give you a hard stop - if i can find us a smooth spot to get going here. f 06 20 44 10 cc jim, this is houston here. how does that camera seem to be working?"
"okay, gordy, that's my fault. i didn't know you were up-linking. you've got the omni, and i'll leave it. 0k 13 58 07 cc okay, we'll stay on the omni for the up-link."
"okay, jack. we've got 14 cartridges that'll last 157 hours, plus we've got the i_mprimary cartridge with 23 hours, and we've got two plss cartridges with 7 hours apiece."
"no, they didn't say that. they said they had it - -"
"- - there's no point in deviating around and spending 15 minutes trying to get a particular spot or down to a bigger boulder. you must be in the near vicinity. if you're really worried about it, i guess you might drive a little bit to the east to the rim of the - -"
check it here.
roger.
here it is.
"casper, the dac should be running. 07 05 32 oh cmp dac is running."
wish we could get that 16-millimeter camera ...
i wonder if any of this food is - the - the ir- radiated food. tl 11 16 26 cdr could be ....
"okay. 02 flow high, pegged."
"sesc, huh?"
yes.
"and, ken. whenever you get a chance, gamma ray, shield, on. when you get through with this."
"apparently it did, and then it stopped again, several times."
"yes, i've got it. okay, let me get that other thing in here."
roger. go ahead.
"3, 2, i -"
"there it is! look at it! goldarn! watch it - just - keep - just click them off. oh, that is fantastic!"
...
copy.
parking that beauty over there. and my ... was right on the time.
okay. that's one of then.
"say, orion. we figure this 8 minutes of refill is enough rest. we'll start eva-2 i,w_ediately. 05 06 29 19 cdr-ik4 (laughter) you better send a couple more guys up here. you better start them here in the next 5 minutes. 05 06 29 26 lmp-i;4 yeah, i really think i could take another couple hours except for my fingers. 05 06 29 30 cdr-ha{ yeah, i think so too. i could - i could do the _ning around; that would be a piece of cake."
i knew what the transformation error was.
roger.
"well, that - all those hours. okay. we got all the pictures except for the ones john's supposed to take of the mortar package. and i'm skipping the heat flow ones. and we're up to magazine - we're 100 - 102 on - 101 on magazine alfa."
"okay - okay. suit gas diverter, pull-egress. 04 17 11 47 lmy okay. pull-egress."
almost.
just leave the data system on. we've commanded it off on the ground.
okay. let's start sep - sep checklist here.
we're not - we're not pointed at the sun - yes. and the moon's behind us. some place behind the sun. isn't it?
roger.
"i've done this so many times, i'm getting bored."
"what do you want, 0157"
they s_reopen.
"good morning, gold team, this is the command module pilot of the spaceship america, and we're ready to go to work again this morning."

okay. stand by 1.
"okay. you should have your 2 and a quarter minutes, so any time you want to go on."
roger.
"i'm not so sure we got a good fillet on this last one, so we might be willing to sample another."
"okay. sounds like we had something loose in panel 2, huh?"
our tv dow_ here is just beautiful.
"thank you, ron, he's listening right here, and he's been on the console during the whole period. got a big grin on his face right now."
fuel cell purge is complete.
"dave, the story on the biomed is essentially the following. we've got a good heart rate on you, or at least readable, when you're perfectly still. otherwise, we're not able to pull the rate out of the signal return that we're getting. and we've talked it over here. you're going to be the pacing item on this - we're going to give you a go ahead and rely on your own good judgment to keep us posted on crew status. we're all aware that this eva is physically a fairly easy eva, with the exception of the drill work coming up towards the last, and we may have more information regarding your biomed sensors. we'll give to you then. is that reasonably clear?"
"roger. the waste stowage vent valve, closed. 00 08 19 44 cml° we've done that. okay, we're starting our maneuver now."
yes. 06 oo 06 08 imp-eva maybe we could take that back as - take it back as a large one. do you want to wait until we get over to a fresh crater? _-_
"okay, now start. there you go."
"i think i'll just stay out here and put you at about 300 feet, which we are. there's a nice little rise here. and i'll point you - you want to be heading 255. yes, that's all messed up, too. just slightly, okay. south and west, i got a good spot for you, joe. joe, what's my relative azimuth at the sun right now, with west."
"very good. i'm coming right now. i *** dollar to doughnuts that you don't get a tge reading. 06 18 20 3_ cc yes, gene. if you're - if it's easy enough to take it off, why don't you take it off the rover; and we'll try and level it in the stuff."
"(laughing) yes, you're about 2 minutes early on the wakeup. looks like you were really sawing them away. 03 21 33 23 cml° you're right."

"okay. and two more. in row 4 under heaters, open displays and under eps, open displays."
plus 000.04; plus 105.56; plus 000.45.

okay. i've got to get my plss.
"okay, karl, if you're following on the map, i'm right south of the intersection of the la hire rilles and the wrinkle ridge that runs off to the northwest there, just by mount la hire. in fact, i'm directly over mount la hire now, and it looks like there's a volcano in - or not a volcano, but a crater, in the top of the westernmost hill."
let - let's get some gimbals off.
"an etb and two cameras ready to come up. oh, there's my friend again. al bean?"
"yes, just - give me the shovel to hold myself with. give me a shovel."

okay.
dang right. where are - which way should we pitch to get to you?
"roll is 1 left. pitch is 0. heading is 240. i'm in system reset, and we're driving down to zero. and the sun shadow device is at zero."
"that's one of the blue-gray rocks, bob. and it's got a light-colored fragment that runs the full height of it, about a meter and a half thick. and then it's got the gray or blue-gray rock on the other side. as a matter of fact - let me look at it closely. it's a fr_mment in it all right."
"i said, have we got a problem of some kind? are we needing to get charlie back?"
"okay, houston, the old battery covers are pretty dirty - at least one of them is. i'll get them."
"hello, challenger. hello, challenger; this is houston. how do you read?"
"okay, ken. just at this appearance, it appears that everything is swinging along all right with them, but we'll have you a good scientific read- out on it tomorrow."
"10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 -"

roger.
it's minus 90 and ...
"hello, houston. are you reading yet?"
got the dump valves to auto?
"roger, joe. that's - that's a good analysis. we took mag charlie and tried to run it with our fin- gers and it won't run. it's absolutely jammed right in the beginning. and we'll run the others through tonight to make sure they'll work."
okay. okay stand by for an enter.

i can't imagine how they wouldn't be in the - the - the clast that charlie picked up. look at these rocks here that i just stepped on.
"okay, jim. i didn't waistto talk about that because we're not quite ready to recommend a procedure. we can't power up tile cm/rcs per the nornal ehecklj st on t.hclm power because we haven't got quite enou_h amps. it may he that we']_] want you to heat - to do the preheat one ring at a time and we're looking at 'that. another possibility' is t_latwe may want to take down lm power at ibat,time, d_)the preheat, and then go backlto ][_p_c'r uritii we have to take it down f_na]ly. over."

give it ...
okay.
okay.
"okay, geno, i understand you're undocked. but we're not reading, but about l0 percent of what you're saying. stand by ..."

"apollo 11, apollo 11, this is houston. over."
"that's the impression i have. i hate to - to say yes certainly. my impression is that it just won't - won't level. it - it will accept commands, but the beam will just not level for a - a reason that they just don't fully understand."
"if you can get it on, fine; if not, don't worry about it."
that's affirm. comm was very good all during - throughout the entire flight. much better than i expected.
"okay; we'll pick you up at the keyhole. 56:45, you ought to be ordeal, operate. right?"
...... all powered down.
"how's that, joe?"

"okay. it's sticking - right - turn around. no, that's not right."
the old or - orange juice comes in great.
"that - that agrees, we think, jim. we'll think it over once again here. 06 02 55 32 irp-eva okay. and i figure - think you can get through there, dave?"
"okay, fellows, i have a preliminary statement to make here. the questions you will be asked in this news conference have been submitted by newsmen here at the manned spacecraft center who've been covering the flight. some of the questions they raised have been answered in your c_mmunications with - with mission control, but the public at large has not necessarily heard them. the ques- tions are being read to you exactly as submitted by the newsmen and in an order of priority specified by them. question number 1. since last week, we have shared scores of exciting moments with you. which single moment would you most like to live again, and is there any moment which you would never like to repeat?"

okay.
"okay, houston, 15. pyro arm is safe, logic is off, and the pyro arm circuit breakers are pulled."
will you - call and let me know when ... finishes its burn? time skip

"okay. ah-ha, i got the old helmet and gloves on."
"squelch, enable."
okay. i'm rolling.
thank you.
"okay, i guess we'll - start getting back in then. i'm up below the camera right now."

would you like to have been informed of the suc- cessful sinta - simulation and the trade-off factors involved?

"orion, you're go for pdi."
i'll have to go back to the backroom on that. apollo 17 air-to-ground voice transcription
aren't you going to do your roll?
"yes. i agree. but we decided just in case we have any glitch with the ags, we want to make sure we get that lm off in a good shape. and i agree with you on keepiag out all the garbage on _t."
you'll be in sync all the way out to that time; just - we're just going to delete and jump you to 67:40.

"15, this is houston."
"no. as a matter of fact, from this altitude, even though we're low, they appear to be smooth and rounded. there aren't any jagged peaks that we can see. and even though they're cratered and rough in texture on a small scale, they really don't look anything like the alps or the san juans or any of the other familiar ranges we know."
okay. pin it down.

"when we look back at the apollo program i don't think anyone can privately to themselves and pub- licly say that this isn't truly indeed really a beginning - a beginning of man's really first ven- ture out into deep space. and once there's a be- ginning, there's a continuation. the probing into deep space by man, the next landing on the moon, a trip to mars may not be for 10 years, a decade; it may not be until the end of this century. but i personally have faith that it will happen. i think it's a restraint, an abnormal restraint of man's intellect at this point in time to restrict or tend to think that he will restrict his own feeling of exploration, his own quest for knowledge. he's had ailopportunity. he's proved that he could take advantage of this opportunity, and i think that the nature of mankind is going to just press on. that's why i believe not - we of apollo 17 - yes, it's a beginning; but the whole apollo program is really the true beginning of what's to come in the future. and i firmly believe that. we can look back in a 100 years or 200 years and the 5-year or 10-year period of time, we may be slowed down here. i think we'll be - we'll be lost in the merit of what is really accomplished during the next several decades."
"okay, tony. why don't we go down halfway, john, and do another rake sample, and then go down to the black - big, black rock? 06 23 31 143 cdr-eva ail right. yeah. 06 23 31 k6 _4p-eva and that's a good - that'll be about 150-meter radial - not radial, but concentric sampling. i'm on intermediate cooling now, tony."

"we copy you, ken."
"joe, there's so much dust on the camera that - by the way, jim, let me get your camera lens while we 're at it."
"okay, joe. i'm on the surface."
"okay, joe. i don't have a star in the sextant. i'm going to hunt for it in a minute."
"oh, you mean this one, here."
"apollo 11, houston. over."

"aquarius, houston."
back here.
"okay, go ahead with the ags."
okay; it's coming back on now.

"okay, ken. that's al i've gc5 on that one."
"okay, that - that's probably bowen there, don't you think?"
"endeavour, this is houston."
"and on the next page, at 194:10 -"
six more minutes - which will be 2_. we're right on it.
under there? okay. go ahead.
"okay. yes, that's good. but you'd like it pointed down, right? yes, that makes sense. now, is your belt under the scissor pocket? okay. we got our comm carriers on, so that's no problem. you ought to put your comm carrier on now. and then we do a comm check. 10 13 32 32 cml° hey, houston. this is the old command module pilot back on the loop. how do you read?"
"well, i guess if - if anyone can do it, he can do it, if you can find him."
"oh, okay; i got you. man, i hope that hole doesn't collapse. i'm going to be awful disappointed. i think i could drive that heat flow flux - or heat flow - or neutron flux in, at least for one probe, without any problem. okay, bob, if all goes well in the next few short moments, you'll have the final - unleaded'(?) - cores stem - automatic - in this area - on apollo 17."
"houston, aquarius."
"right on - right on the spot, pete."
"here, come on down."
excellent.
"okay, dave. did you get that? delta-v thrust a and b, two of them, to normal right after the pro at the flashing 99?"
"you'd have never stayed with it, jim. you know ..e"
"yes, yes, that's why it's crooked, it's over those pieces."

"okay, houston, that's my plss feedwater, no sweat. 05 15 21 15 _p head down, come down. that's better. move to your left slightly."
"(laughter) well, there's an easy way to do everything. the question is can you hang on to it once you've done it?"
"roger. endeavour, houston. falcon is calling, and he's ready for the rendezvous radar check."
"nc),they want it right beside it, right there ... 06 04 06 23 cdr-ewa you can't see any of that stuff."
check those ...
"roger. what is it now, jim? 04 02 29 04 imp when you say in source pressure, you mean helium?"
"hey, that helped. okay. no changes now on 29, 30, and 31. next page is 32. 05 09 15 45 lmf okay. i'm on 32. 05 09 i[548 cc okay. at the very first step above ""guidance control, ags_"" put in verb 76, enter."
"and, jim, we have a lengthy procedure here for powering up the csm and turning on instrumentation so we can check the tm, and this will take a large piece of scratch paper whenever you're ready to copy."
right on 221. right down the tube. 09 o? 51 58 cmp yes. good act.
there's some white stuff in that rock. just let me take a quick pic ...
"it - it's a - it's the - the same kind of rock - the same kind of rock i saw near the lm - and the gabbro - i'm beginning to lean towards 50 percent plagioclase, though."
okay. i'll give you a hack on it.
roger that. (columbia )
you're the commander.
"came out of the soil. i just didn't want to miss it. we'll remember that. that goes in bag num- ber 173, and, well, our friends in the back room are writing that down right now."
"okay, now. i'm going to mode select b. (tranq)"
what's that?
yes.
"okay, ron, this next one - actually we're calling it 212:20, but the simulator came out at 212:18:40, just for information. and it's the following: stop scan at roll 039."
okay. do you want me to start out with the 500?
yes. okay. you ready?
"okay, jack. we're reading you loud and clear right now. oh, you're going out a little bit now."

yes. i know. the top of mine is covered with dust too.
yes. the brightness is still doing q_ite well. you can go ahead and open it up a sto_ or two. the a_tomatic light level compensation seems to be working beautifully. 03 06 52 58 i2&_ there's a good picture of boot hill.
they all do that. they don't do anything - -
"plus or minus 5 - 25 over there? no, that - that one."

"jack, a couple of quick items. we would like for you to terminate the battery a charge now, and also turn the h2 tank heaters for tanks 1 and 2 off."
"okay. it's not so much a _rohlem entirely, it's jusv keeping track of things, and you just - once a guy starts putting that suit on, he commands the rest of the volume in the spacecrafv. it's a - tha% a7lb is a real - real interesting operation. if we can use the i/_ for it, that will help out a great deal."

do you have an hour on your clock for ...
"jim, just make sure that the ears are pulled back before you plug it in."
"okay, i'll start in a minute."

okay. %_is the last row you got on that?
"karl, this is a1 again. looking down into the sulpicius gallus area, looking at some of the wrinkle ridges and some of the rilles - the arcuate rilles down there, i can make out some distinct color patterns that seem to run parallel to the arcuate rilles - an_ along the wrinkle ridges, and there is a very subtle darker color, again almost as if it was - some kind of cinder fallout along the ridges and along some of the rilles."
"there you go, mate. go ahead. okay ... music (hey, little woman)"
"yes, i think we are t_lking to you guys through the lm right now, and how about a speed reading?"

"(chuckle) i'm very well pleased, geneo. your - your language is superb. apollo 17 air-t0-ground voice transcription"
yeah. look at that bench in crown.
"okay, gordy. you can go ahead, and you have data on the updata link."
"in small chips. well, you can - you did it with your hands there. i call that being friable, compared to what we 'ye seen ar4vway."

"how do you read, jim?"
i'm looking at 5.5....
i got it.
"but it, it, it -"

okay.
"the weather prediction for your landing area is still good; 2000 scattered, high scattered; 4-foot seas, 15-knots wind. there's a hurricane 500 miles to the west, which doesn't pose a problem. 04 16 39 02 i24p a hurricane or a typhoon?"
go ahead.
whatever that means.
"how's it coming, jack?"
"dave, it looks to us like it's one of the two top sensors, and we were wondering how difficult it would be to reseat both of them now. 09 22 25 i1 cdr okay. i'll tell you what we'll do. a little further down the line here, we'll take care of both of those. we'll ... them and reseat them and everything."
okay. okay; switching to alfa.

"okay. and let me advise you of something that's coming up. before you get your pgas doffed and over the engine cover, we want to stow that extra lioh canister back in the bracket there. 05 07 01 51 lmp-i_ okay, yeah, we'll get that."
"okay. there's albategnius, and he's got a nice cayley floor and a whole bunch of the - like a concentric ring, but i can't - yeah, by golly, there's a concentric ring in that thing just like there is in the mare. and - it goes most of the way around. some places it's overlain with the - like the crater klein hides it."
is that in vent?
"charlie, let's let's get a piece of it."
okay.
"well, don't do it yet, i haven't gotten it broken down yet. but i got it out of the ground with a little help."

"okay, endeavour. we'll be firing a direct ..."
that's right. (eagls)
"you're doing real good there, charlie."
"now, that's complicated."
"hey, bob. did you get anything from the alsep yet?"
"good show. if - if you didn't get much chlorine in the buffer, won't hurt anything, but it would have hurt the other way if you'd put the chlorine in without adding the buffer, so - either way, we're in good shape now."
"i don't know what it is, though."

"okay; houston, 15. we're starting."
b's coming open.
"oxidizer, good."
"oh, okay."
i just haven't had - haven't had the free minutes since they came up to do that.

okay. minus 76 and ll7.
yes.
okay. i'm going to go over behind me and take part of the stereo.
"roger, mike. thank you much. have you seen any more water collecting on the aft bulkhead? over."
"endeavour, houston."
"understand. 06 04 42 ho lmp-eva - - to get that thing on and off from the rover seat. i should have turned it on on the si_e, but at 12 frames a second i thought we'd just run too much out. okay, it's running now."
"hey, and even the floor of the crater is mantled down there. i_4p-eva you know, that seems - yes. that seems like a - what you got? a piece of glass?"

which one?
"oh, rats."
that's the difference.
"charlie, these grits are all right."
"okay, we've got 2 minutes to los. you don't have to read back. i think - -"
"11, this is houston. stand by a minute, please. we're having difficulty receiving you."

"roger; i copied, charlie. 2, t cc orion, this is houston. are you als_ showing bad data on the tapemeter for the iandirlg radar?"

"roger. we saw you up stirring around, and we thought that you were probably eating _'our break- fast there. just in general, we'll probably start coming up with the uplink of the state vectors and the target loads and what have you at about 190 50, somewhere in that area, and get you started to work."
okay. how long until aos?
"rad, reac, reac, reac - okay, i can verify three rads and three reacs out."
"okay, all ... be done behind here."
"okay. we copy that, ron. the sounder still looks good, perking right away. and the mapping camera funny i mentioned earlier - we haven't nailed down exactly what it is. most likely, we think it's just an instrumentation erroneous indication. and so, we're going to continue with the normal schedule of activities on the mapping camera, except, of course, for the deploy and retraction."
that's the only - -

"okay. in your flight plan, at 199:20, you can strike pcm cable, unless your relativistic speed has mauaged to lengthen that cable, i guess. at 199:25, you can strike the three lines, ""cmc mode, verb 22, and cmc mode."" and, then i have a pad for you at 200 plus 20, when you're ready."
it's just like a refrigerator.
"i can park 180 but - 05 00 l_ 03 cdr-eva okay, bob, i've stopped - back at the sep."
"no, we don't, because then we don't want that hatch to get closed."
"roger, copy."
"okay. step 7 follows: ""circuit breaker panel ll, ac bus b, helium pqgs propellant display, closed. circuit breaker ll, ac bus b, numeric lightii_g, closed. circuit breaker ll, ac bus b, bus tie inverter l, closed. circuit breaker panel ll, eps inverter l, closed. circuit breaker panel 16, instrumentation sig sensor, closed. inverter l"" - -"
"man, the pile is high in here, too. two etb loads, an src, and an extra rock bag."
we copy.
awfully frustrating.
that's all of them.
"okay, i got to get out of my shadow or i can't see what i'm doing."
"it's no good in tvc either, in the gimbal drive check."
roger. omni bravo.
"att/translation, 4 jets?"
okay. thank you. that's in work.
"no, no. i've - i've been home and sacked out."
"and the cover is up. cover is up, if i can keep it up. if i can keep it up. that'll keep it up. it's been dusted. and i'll get it to standby."
- - back home.
roger. and the time is 177:20:33.
"yeah, it works just like it's supposed to now. 10 o0 58 23 cc i °'' ?con al"
okay -
"... there. we don't have nothing ... ·07 02 41 08 _ yes, we do...."
...
roger. understand.
"ro_=_; g_-5- an_, john, settin6 it on the floor w_ll be fine, if the hose is long enough so it doesn't tilt. 05 06 33 29 cdr-ir ok... now, we may - we may leave - on the midstep is where we're th_nkin_ about doin= it."
"okay. copy that, gene. thank you."
"ken, houston."
"well, you guys tried to beat it into us long enough, i'll tell you that. hope we did a good job."
(laughter) turn - turn to the left.
"go. 07 04 29 35 ixmp l, 1."
"okay, on the fuel oxidizer press, where you put in 124 oxidizer, you want to change that to 138 oxi- dizer, and the fuel goes from ll0 to ll2. in other words, instead of 124 ox, ll0 fuel, we want 138 ox, ll2 fuel."
"thank you, tony. okay; 2 is installed."
okay.
okay.
"yeah, i bet that breaks you un."
track mode to slew.
we ought to get a piece of the normal gray that the dikes are coming from. *** your hammer handy still?
"okay, that solves the mistery. thar_ you."
"while ed is loading up the etb, i'll describe the general landing site. we are, in fact, in a - in a low area. there seems to be a general swale or a wide valley between the triplet craters and the doublet craters. and we are on - we are on the downhill side at this particular point. it levels off at a lower elevation to the left of the lm, approximately 15 feet lower there, and then it % confidentj starts back up to the rim of doublet. it's a very uneven landing area here. and, of course, like all of the sections of the moon, it's pock- marked by a - enormous amount of craters. the surface here, as we pointed out, is mostly fines, and i hate to discuss any kind of lineations here in the immediate vicinity of the lm, because i can see very definite indications of the radial dust pattern caused by the descent engine. and *** any other lineal pattern, as such, right here in the area. 0_ 18 28 09 cdr there are perhaps half a dozen very large rocks at the i o'clock position from the lm. but per- haps they're ejected from cone, although they don'5 seem to have any particular ray pattern. they probably are ejected from - from doublet, since they appear to be closer to doublet than they do triplet. they are a lighter gray in material - excuse me - the material is lighter gray in color, and i'm certain that we'll get some of those samples on the way back from our als_ deployment. it's very difficult to assess any kind of stratigraphy in cone right now, look- ing back at it, because we're looking into the sun at a low sun angle, and it's just not the right direction to view that crater when looking for stratigraphy. but there certainly are boul- ders on it. from here, it looks as though they're at least 20 feet in diameter perhaps, at least the ones _e can see here in the western slope. they appear to be grouped fairly close to the rim of _he crater and not too many large boulders on down the sides of the slopes, the outside rim. okay, it looks as though the lm was traveling slowly forward and slowly to the right. as you'll see from the photographs, that's the direction of the landing gear probes, as they're bent. the footpad, plus-y, for example, has a drag pattern of approximately 1 foot."
i was glad i reminded them. s-band - -
...
...
"intrepid, houston. how do you read? 04 13 _4 33 cdr roger. we read you loud and clear, and we just watched our first earthrise, which was fantastic! and we had a great doi burn. the x residual was zero; y was plus 0.2; and z was minus 0.6. j;onfidenti"
"okay, copy 475."
i don't know whether it's tough or not. you mean hard.
"which one, the eomm thing?"
have at it.
ail right. and there's - and the lm site - -
houston. roger. out.
okay. copy that.
yeah.
okay.
okay.
"roger, houston. what we're going to do is, we're going to get rid of fred's suit here. fred's suit has been right in the commander's slot here for the last half hour. so we're going to try and get it stowed."
"casper, how do you read houston? 08 oh 45 30 cmp hello there."
"orion, we're happy with your present rcs configuration."
affirm.
"you want to hear it? let's hear it again, huh? (laughter) you don't like it, i know (laughter). it's got to be loud to be enjoyed."
"yes. it might be a slujnp block, or something - like that."
"okay, now - keep going."
stand by.
mark.
"roger, ron. we copy those times."
"roger, america. it's houston. we're ready to have you come home today."
"casper, houston. could you bring up the high gain? pitch, plus 41; yaw, 228."
... going like this. yeah. i keep looking back at the eight ball to see.
i think he wants to verify that.
"ordeal, 300/lunar."
i g_ess we'll give ken credit for that one.
go ahead.
"i'm going to let you - i'm going to let you do that, okay?"
"17, houston. a reminder. we need the h2 purge line heaters, on, now. and i do have a maneuver pad for the midcourse when.you're ready to copy. over."
i mean in all the big craters like camelot.
roger. ecs auto transfer is open - and i'll open _ the glycol pump 1 now.
okay.
"well, you can pro on that anyhow. where - where do we do our thing here?"
the tvc enable relay?
okay .... under a white. we just wondered - - / con fident at _-_ day 6 page 369
roger.
"keep pressing, john."
"roger. on the tm here, we noticed some fluctua- tions that may have been attributed to your moving the sensors around or pushing on them, but the erratic problem seems to be persisting. 06 05 4_ 27 _ houston, apollo 11. over. 06 05 4_ 40 cc ll, this is houston. over. 06 05 44 45 i_p roger. i wonder if you've noticed any change in the biomed returns you're getting. over."
"16, houston. you're looking good, and you're go for the burn."
"oh; going into the sun, i can't see a thing to tell you about wessex cleft."
do you have - do have any dark - do you have any dark halo craters near sulpieius gallus?
roger.
it's looking up.
"we're all set to go, mike."
"roger. for your information, the laser from mcdonald observatory in west texas will be up from about 181 hours and 30 minutes, on for 1 hour. you should be able to spot the earth out of the number 1 window every time you pass roll 357 degrees and then, of course, mou're in west texas. over."
"- - is - this could be a south - south - south ray, course, that's downslope too."
"falcon, houston. we're going to watch it for a few more minutes and see how they converge with the other solution."
"what, john?"
and rendezvous transponder is off.
thirty-six. ·
"that's affirmative, guys. move on."
roger. copy that. thank you.
... seconds. there it is.
yeah.
"roger. we'd like one this morning before the eva, and the surgeons promise they'll look at it today."
i'll just leave it there while you think about it. --
"okay, we're right with you."
okay.
"roger. we got it. o0 07 41 29 cml° houston, is that close enough on the evap temp? looks like i can't hit _5; i can hit 43 or about 46 or 7."
"okay, endeavour, i guess we're ready to start. i want to put one final note on the subsat launch. we'd like for you to reverify for us the talkbacks on the rcs after the launch."
... put it back in the ...
roger; copy.
okay.
"i tell you, i thought this was kind of appropriate here. a few minutes ago, i was playing berlioz' symphonie fantastique and looking at this fan- tastic sight and floating along here, and it's just unbelievable it's so much fun."
"well, there's some stuff behind it, but i can't get at it. i'm not - i just can't. i - i could reach it with the moving the orange drinks, hut if i do, i don't know what i'm gonna do with them. 04 03 41 06 i_mp put them in the flight data file up here. there's plenty of room up here. 04 03 bi 47 lmp clh,oh. excuse me. ,0403 hl hs_ cdr '2chrf a _=_., i kee-o - i keep getting_ them things. 0h 03 l41_ 58 ._r ]n _his one? 04 03 41 59 i_p_ fe_: · __'1*_'n_-r one."
ed.
he's at 45 degrees above us.
okay.
"okay, i'm going to take a couple of north ray, tony."
"thc, clockwise."
"(laughter) okay. they won't let you have a window tonight, huh, ron?"
"well, that was the commander who initiated ptc, and i've already heard about that."
"okay, gordo. if you're reading, i've got the gyro torquing angles up, and i'll torque them out at 5:30."
"dave, we want steering forward, off."
"how about papa i there, geno. 0h 21 36 29 cdr-eva bingo, babe, you win; and it locked in."
don't work too hard.
"well, _he way i've been falling, i probably would. that's why i steered way clear. boy, this back- pack, once you get it torqued off, you can't - can't stop it."
"let me ask you a question, houston. how big a rock?"
okay. you got the - also the one camera which had the third film pack on?
"okay, when did you start your time?"
celebrate.
"huh? no. _-lm and, gordy, we did not eat the corn chowder."
charlie (laughter).
"charlie, there should be a green strap that you should be able to pull up on that'll lift it."
"that's affirmative. just bat 6, jack. and the next line, you had battery i and 3. make that battery l, 2, 3, and 4. just add bats 2 and h° all four descent bats. and then the next two lines about waiting 30 minutes, cross that out. and the next line about batteries 2 and 4 off/ reset, cross that out, too."

ail the - -
okay; 415 plus 10 000; 31 - -
"64; and we have pitchover, houston. oh 12 11 13 lmp there's pro. you have it?"
okay.
... once every hour?
okay. we copy that.
go to dump.
"okay; and let me give them a voltage reading, and i'm still reading 68 and 68."
"no, we looked at it when we got back in, joe. the string broke at its attach point on the inside of the yo-yo."
wait - wait - we've got to get the attitude stopped here. why don't you go ahead and pro?
"okay, henry. thank you."
"okay, we're getting pretty close now. about anjther 5 degrees of roll is all. can you see i_?"
"we copy that. li_ is stu getting - did stu get bubbles on his pattern, bob?"
baseband.
"roger; thank you. and also, we'd like to get an ops read-out sometime prior to your going to sleep tonight."
... yes. pag4e-6 ticonfidenti 6
"that shit, that - that's waste food - and that's all ..."
columbia. go ahead. columbia
"okay. that ""verb 48"" should be moved up to 105:05 and also the ""verb 49."""
"how about that? oh, that's pretty good. we got a good navigator."
"they're going to stay running until over at 163:35 or so is where they - they go off, and we're - we're just going to retract the camera."
"tell you one thing, ... geting the suit - -"
this looks like a big one of those.
"good readback. turning over to page 14, step 2, we want you to change the dap noun 46 to 31021. then after the noun 47, insert ""verb 34, enter."" over. 03 03 08 15 imp okay. on page 14, a vfaqb 48, dap load, noun 46 changed to 31021. i assume you will give us any updated weights if we need any, and after the noun 47, a ""verb 34, enter."" so, i - you're saying our gimbals look all right."
"hey, it's unlocked. #** again. #** comes."
"okay, houston. here we go. i'm gonna run over the switch configuration that i've got in the cockpit. we're going to do this - everything except calling p40, or do you want to call p40 for something?"

i heard it. gadzooks!

"oh, yes?"

"oh, the rascal."
okay. here.
"apollo 13, houston. we read you weakly. go ahead."
... sort of oriented - - 10 01 14 52 cml° ... power must be on.
let me get up on the high part.
"what are you doing with the dsky, now?"
it is off.
... all right ...
"it's right on it, ... okay, verb 77_ ..."
"apollo 13, houston."
i have to keep telling jack that the blue stuff down there is water.
roger. we'll be sending the yaw command at 4:31.
"not quite, al. did you just pass me some sun- glasses, dave?"
"i don't know, it looks that way."
roger. and be advised that the cmc dap is inoper- ative between the time you set the bit and the time you do the verb 40.
"and, houston; challenger. i still have a visual on america."
"okay, gordo. that's good information to have."
mike mike is starting with number 1.
roger.
i am free.
"pete, you ought to move this, because i was look- ing; that thing could fall off there and hit your dsky now. you ought to put somewhere else."
roger. optics zero.
"casper, houston. go ahead."
"okay, challenger; we've just lost about 16 db on your high gain signal strength there. we're wondering if you happened to hit the switch there, has it moved, or could you give us a check on it?"
huh?
"okay. let's see, get - get the - suppose we could use magazine ss? that other one. 03 04 29 42 imp that one's the magazine you want to use for this? r_ _ , . _ _ ' . , _.="
"no, i'm just trying to relate it to when we were coming in. i'd say it's more like 5."
"yes, could be. you got a final - oh, you don't get a final comp until - -"
"you go to off and then back to zero, right?"
"i don't think so, jack. that doesn't sound very good to me - -"
"buzz, this is houston. it's about time for you to start your eva closeout activities."
can i go ahead and open the alpha cover?
good enough. thank you.
"okay, i'm rolling west right now."
0k_y. i'm approaching. your attitude looks good. 07 09 35 40 cm_ i'll tell you when we have capture.
"roger. we want you to verify that you're in auto d_4p on the water, that's the pressure relief in the number 2 position - that's vertical. and if you have an opportunity to get away from the controls there, we'd like you to manually dump the water to 10 percent on the back side. that should require about 17 minutes. over."
okay.
roger.
"okay, gordy, the lmtibinel valve is in lm press, and equalization valve is closed."
that's affirm.
"hey. number 1, coming out. 02 19 09 06 imp okay. got her down."
"okay. i'm going to have to climb over where you are, john, for just a minute."
"in fact, dune should be dead ahead, dave, so we'll probably have to steer a little to the right to go around the western side of dune."
"okay. here, do you want to torque at 40? what do we torque at rendezvous?"
"you should hear - hear it in the room when i m_ke a comment like that. i get 14 people saying, ""l not 2."""
okay. i hope they don't come out this time.
"i'll get it. i'll get it, jack. don'v worry. okay. we have a couple of dents in our fen - in our wheels. that's better than having a flat tire. did he say in a crater? t_mp-eva i'm not sure what he said. *** how do i get this doggone -"
(music: the first time ever i saw your face by roberta flack)
i'll be with you in a second ....
"yes, i think i'll do that right now. fred-o, get on the ..."
"did i miss that one, charlie?"
"houston, on the aft omni. how do you read? 0_ 00 22 09 cc orion, this is ttouston. we'd like you to _roceed now with this attitude maneuver, and i'll give you fdai angles and the steerable angles."
"okay. 04 23 08 b8 cdr *** plss pt *** maintain, right, verify. *** okay, plss mode, a, wheel counterclockwise."
"and just for checking on the water intake, you should have me down for six containers of water."
"jack, you're in the shadow right now; we have a little bit of interference from your window, which is very bright, so we can't - i think you're smiling, but it's a little hard to tell."
that's affirmative.
...
"actually, vance, what you're looking at is solid water droplets coming out just about all the time. it lights up the whole sky around the moon. it's just far too fine for you to see. now i think they're coming out a little thicker."
"okay, ron, we see the 9bs; and you're clear to torque them."
"say again, ron."
okay. ready?
...?
"houston, 15. _f- 02 03 23 11 cc go ahead, 15. this is houston."
good readback. 07 oh 06 05 lm? 03170. 07 04 06 21 i2.lp i hear the john your_g music right here.
"you have delta-t. of zero; burn time was about zg 1 second short, i'd say, huh? ..."
"aquarius, houston."
it - it's wild.
"it'll do. i've got to take this tool off .... camera. okay .... over on the y-pad, next to my handy-dandy rock box 2, which is neatly covered. you want it sitting in the sunshine, is that cor- rect, houston?"
same here.
that's affirmative.
"no, those are the lm pans ...."
...
"yeah. i think you can hook a right here a little bit, john. looks pretty good. there's really a lot of craters here, tony, at 1.6 at 348. the top of survey is just pockmarked. they're pretty subdued, though. we can drive through them up to 3-meter ones with no problem. you're still making 6 clicks, john. the characteristics of the rocks, tony, are the same _s _6und the lunar module. !"
just a minute.
roger. the moon at 10 degrees. tat_e 58/i!
"okay. too bad, because it just won't go on. it's - such a tight tolerance on that thing anyway."
thank you.
"yes, i used it backing out - -"
"okay. this is much easier than it was before. don't pull so hard, i guess. can't believe that big hole back there."
"yes, let me put this in your bag."
there; it's going to stay.
there you go.
he said we're clear enough - - 00 o2 39 o6 aa ...
"okay, joe."
right. ***04. 04'll 46 16 lmp ***04.
"yes, you're probably looking at a - oh, i don't know - maybe a what - a 12-hour old prog, or something? apollo 17 air-to-ground voice transcription"
"hello, houston; apollo 14. 08 23 40 28 c_p there's the hcrizon."
"okay, i'm all set."
"give me an r and r-dot, would you, pete, in 10 minutes_"
and we copied that those bat covers are closed - -
"yes, they - -"
coming - coming your way.
roger. we copy; thank you. 09 09 50 _0 cmp and we filled it from about 45.
"okay, we lost you there a minute. 04 06 53 59 cm_ okay. do you want another omni? {0_ 06 54 04 cc stand by."
"man, that south ray is really something."
sure as hell can.
"yes, dog sierra at 63; that's on the boo-meter scale there."
mark that.
"the visibility through the telescope has been very poor. it's, i would say, even worse than the simulator is right now. it requires long periods of dark adaptation which most times are most inconvenient; so it's really a tremen- dous asset to keep the platform powered up at all times and to keep it tweaked within the capability of the sextant field of vjew."
"go ahead, endeavour."
we'll be awaiting your call.
okay. 05 il 23 2_ lmp they fit up there okay.
"after you put all that in the dsky, i'll do my align - -"
"roger. __ cdr okay, bob. assume the booster is still looking good, and we'll be go for a nominal tli."
"okay, what i'm going to do is - -"
"okay, you look good."
i heard- -
"okay, we need the ir, on, now."
(cleared throat)
"hey, i got it out to the white line now."
we ought to trench it.
there we go. okay.
"your choice on that, cdr. you're ahead of the time line right now."
okay.
"(laughter) well, i can't get close enough right now to see. there's - -"
"okay. pete, ..."
okay.
roger. we'll make suave it works before we use it.
"the cdr food intake, as with all of us, is a little bit random, and i don't know exactly the best way to report it, unless you want it all in detail."
yes.
"now we're going down in a - another - another 2 to 300 meter - maybe 500-meter subdued crater. that's really going to be a steep slope, if we go straight into it, but john is adroitly maneuvering around it."
"okay. at 144:30, it's time to start the deep- space measurements, the gum nebula, and at 144:31, gum nebula photo sequence b, page x/2-8."
okay. take your time. thing's coming out real well. the name of the game is to get the alse? here. whee! up to one crater and over another (laughter).
"okay. delete ""battery charge a,"" and you want to leave it on b."
"balance couple, on."
when are you going to do that?
okay; that's nice to hear.
stand by for s-ivb to orbit capability.
"well, put it right back in again. it won't bomb it. hurry. put in - push a right range rate in."
bet i ain't been that low on this flight. i always thought it was probably - -
"and, dave and jim, i've noticed a very slight smile on the face of the professor. i think you very well may have passed your final exam."
"okay, add- to ad to today. not last night, but - i guess the first night i was in bed - i definitely saw some of these - because i had a hard time going to bed, to start with - i saw some of the same peripheral horizon-type things you said were not the type of data you were looking for; but i also saw a - some sets of the streaks. and probably the one most imposing thing i remember is - and the last one i remember before falling asleep - was the fact that there was a very bright spot that flashed right between my eyes like a very bright headlight - like a train coming at you, only with a flash. it's difficult probably to estimate the frequency of any of those because i was in a - sort of a sleep-hazy mode."
that bag is a monster now.
very good.
"well, if we've got the film, by golly, i'd like to take a lot of terminator photos."
what was the first orbit update pad?
"okay, casper. this is houston. we're convinced that we want you to fire directly at the lm, about 5 feet per second. we want to get a positive closing rate."
okay. m2z- i've got 400 plus 1 in.
"aquarius, houston."
"that's affirm, jack."
"okay. and as you guys say farewell to the moon, we're looking up to the earth down here where you guys are returning pretty soon."
"get a little closer, so you get that big chip out of there. a little closer, jim. yes, that's right. okay. let's go down and get a chunk of the bedrock here. 06 21 45 05 l_p-eva oh, you're getting the bedrock here, huh?"
again? how's your tm?
okay.
"yes, you are, charlie. how do you copy us? you sound better than you did on lm cnmm."
have you got some of those?
"okay. on the zodiacal light: the - after the first 20-second frame, i got out of shut - sync on the shutter, and i fired off two more frames before i got down to - to 10 seconds. and then i went to 10 seconds and then 5 seconds, in order."
"oh, that - -"
"a little soon for supper, huh?"
"..., too."
i don't like to come across that area; that s-band line is too tender.
i don't think we got any of - in that sample i got.
we'll want to make an integrity check.
"okay. ags, 412, read. oops, oh, those are sen- sitive (laughter). plink' 1. okay. i want 000, - -"
well -
"and, ken, houston."
"roger. during that glitch there, did it go _lmost a peg high? over."
"okay, and i'm going into the landing radar check again. you have it."
"apollo 15, houston. over."
i'm still.
"okay, and the uv cassette is in the etb?"
what happened to your translation control power?

"charlie, i was wondering about - - 04 10 56 37 cdr-i2_ oh, and i do happen to see a white glass in the bottom of it."
"there it is. you're moving away from me. can you prevent that? okay, it's back in."
"no, you're doing great."
roger. we've finished our cycling operatio_s.·_
"and the change out is c_nplete, jack."
"roger, freed-c,. now we ar_m't - also al minus 30 seconds, we aren't lookirjg at an ags burn so you can scratch ""abort pushbutton, push,"" and at delta-v equal to zero, scratch ""abort pushbutton, reset."" 0ver."
"okay. if you want to turn over to 129:25, there abouts."
"that's the plug, they put them in there. just slide it out."
okay. the core tube - and its caps into bag num- ber 2. what loose gear? what are you talking about? used core tubes or new core tubes?
"jack, do you read?"
"okay. this jett bag is so full of junk, i aon'_ know if i can get it through the tnnnel. 07 13 10 00 $mp okay. stow the old rope in the right-hand _em- porary - right hand, okay. that's mine. did that. decon bag straps from top of a-2 and hang on l-3. okay, that's the way it's been for a long time. remove two jett bags, vacuum bag, and the vacuum cable from a-2. okay, the cables are already in the bag. yes. empty jett bag, the vacuum bag, and the cable in left-hand vemporary stowage - put them in last night. ah, yes, that's in %here. okay, let's see. stow the empty jevt - oh, i did that, okay. replace remaining jetv bag on a-2, and load with following. ckay, a-9 is empty, so i got that. fecal bags? oh, those are the empty ones. oh, and - yes, we've got some axtra ones on here. heat flow experiment - aim a gooa job and now it's going down the tubes. okay, it's in the bag. okay, the helmet shield. *** wg's. 07 l3 1i 55 c_ extra ones. okay, that's all four of them. there, forgot to take that one off."
look in - in u-1 back there.
roger. and tony is back in houston on the console.
"20 21 and 20 21 and 30 75, and i'm going to p12. okay. i need a p12 time from you."
yes.
"yes, sure."
is that correct?
"okay. 250th. okay, whatever the distance is -"
get your big foot out of the way.
that's right.
"- - yes, just keep going across in that direction. that'll work. we're bound to get something."
"yes, but that's not craters. you know what that is?"
"yes, the lighting in the 124is very nice now, just like completely daylight; and everything is visible. a good bit lighter than the tunnel was earlier."
i'll draw it out - i'll step it out for you. you can measure it (laughter).
huh?
okay. i can see the scarp. *** see hanover. *** we didn't plan to go to hanover. (laughter) it's steep.
okay. go.
"okay, jack, fine. sounds good."
"okay. we're showing the lower 14 minutes to los; but, we're going to lose data before that. and, we'd like to get that e-memory dump just any time you're ready. we're all configured. 05 12 29 31 cmip you got it."
"yes, sir."

"okay. skip one, and we want main bus b reset to off. over."
...
turn around and let me help you get these in your bag.
roger. copy.
roger. we copied the time and - -
"yes, the mcdivitt purse."
"see, that one wasn't on."
still in the shadows?
"man, i recognize - oh, there's my old buddies, alpha and beta centaurus - southern cross. there's the magellanic cloud ..."
"okay, you have reacq; pitch, zero; yaw, 170."
"okay. wetll be watching for neper. 03 06 37 49 c_lp and notice register 3 has reversed itself, and it's heading back the other way now without any pitch thruster firing."
"we don't need it for anything, do we?"
"ems function, entry."
"fine. i'm on my second stem, here - or i'm starting on it. how are you coming?"
yeah. all the rocks went in there.
okay. here's the countdown.
"that's 2 bravo is reading - oh, about 0.25 to 0.3."
"aquarius, houston. i don't think so at this time. our voice is good now. how's yours?"
"yes, that's what they said."
"let's go to panel 16 on page 17, second row. it's ""asa, ooen.""_ i'm sorry. _=_'s_back u_ sne. it's ""alia,open,"" first, then ""asa."" 07 23 i_220 lmp yeah; okay."

okay. checkout. you ready?
that affirmative. vhf simplex a and _e're tr on vhf.
roger.
okay. i don't want to call p20 because i'm not sure how it would interact with all this other stuff. so i'm gonna try another way of finding you. i'm gonna start a little pitch around. i'll pick you up and catch you later.
"and, houston, want to make sure that we allow enough timc to get to the proper attitude for the burn so that we can be sure we establish the proper attitude and don't have to rush the burn. 04 oh 46 51 cc roger, jim. we -we're looking right now, tentatively, at starting this about 45 minutes before the burn and our sensitivity is - not too bad on this burn. we can go 30 minutes either way and not affect our delta-v. over."
"okay, the ... right up here."
...
"and, tony, we've got some - 5-meter boulders in the bottom of it. some real big ones. the biggest, 5 meters, and the whole bottom is covered; we're going downslope now."
"okay, tony, here we go."
"how do you read on alfa, ron?"
copy that.
"oh, man."
"yes, but the eastern and southeastern rim of swp are just continuous - 0oh - they're just continuous with the slopes of the sculptured hills."
just let it bleed for a while.
do i sound pretty bad? i must. what we're trying to find out is if we have a coremproblem before we start getting into this any further.
you see it? 06 02 46 36 i/_p-eva that - that's one - that one off to your right down there - i think we could turn that one over.
which one? that - -
"ron, everything's looking good as you go here to los; no problems at all. your buddies are down at station 6 right now."
got them okay? good.
and all of mine are closed except descent engine override. logic' s in.
"houston, apollo ll. over."
yes?
"roger. we'd - we'd like to have those out and, as soon as you complete that, let's go ahead and do the - go into the p20 that we're showing at 108 plus 50. let's don't wait for that."
"5:30 - 5 point - ... the same countdown, jack, and then start counting up."
have you - how does the monitor look?
"we'll see you at 93:34:24, bob."
"roger, al. i'm not sure that it's well under- stood - it - it's - all we can say is that its operation is erratic; sometimes it manages to get the - the motion compensation right, and sometimes it doesn't quite make it. that's the problem we're working on down here trying to understand - -"
"well, we wish you were too, tony."
...
yes.
"- - and, also at this time, you may terminate the battery a charge."
"oh, i see it now. okay."
"mark, if you have a gravimeter measurement going."
okay. you wemt to give me that tpi again or did you already pass that down to ground? i didn't copy the residuals there?
i don't think i indexed it after the last one.
this might have been a secondary.
"okay, joe, i'm looking at emu number 5."
did that co2 drop?
"okay, coming up here on - here comes mendeleev."
okay. and we're getting a good picture of the
"we do, but we don't - we're not - we don't have any rocks in it."
"i don't mind a bit, if that's what you need."
"try the f/8, that one? hold me."

thank you.
getting pulse?
"here, i'll stick it in my pocket."
"i'll put my camera on; we'll put the tv camera in the etb, and away we go."
and come right about 3 degrees. very good.
"suit gas diverter, pull/egress; cabin gas return to egress; suit circuit relief, auto. i don't have an ecs light yet."
"roger. right now, it's in standby and power, and - it's been barber pole."

...
"... two off. translation control power, off. rot control power, direct 2, off."
"okay, ignition at 097:40:17.16; noun 81, plus 0068.1, minus all zeros, minus 0058.0. over."

"okay, go ahead."
"okay. that's - that's fred now. i'm trying to put him rightside up, for you folks back there in the sleep station. fred, would you move your hands there so the folks back home can see you?"
it's latched.

okay. we'll start your hour.

black; isn't that sky black?
"okay, bruce, it seems like i lost you when i went to relay on on my panel. i guess that's appro- priate, since i'm still on antares' eomm, is it not? _#* yes, but i don't - what he said when he - when the static came on the line. before i went to relay. no, with relay on, i was not reading him. i'm on ship's comm, so i shouldn't."
"0ooh, boy."
i think it's fifty-four. .
"_here's no way to tell, t. k."
we can just barely see those parts of the lm. they must be in a shadow.
you think this is it?
- - back of the lm.
huh?
roger. don't use your glove or dust brush there.
which way's this thing head?
"looks good to us, 17. and i'd like you to know you had a t-hour and 12-minute eva, from 3.5 to 3.5."
"okay, i veriest 200ths; range pad, 51.7; intervalom- eter; one and two fr_nes; magazine w; frame nzum- her _. ltc installation. record time, 13:21, 766, 88:57:14. ltc checkout. cycle cmo mode, free to auto. i don't want - we don't need that since we - you scratched out a - it had been changed. okay, we're not cha_lging the dap. did a verb 29 maneu- ver to 352, 146. we'll get a tweak on this, i'm sure; 14_ and 355. we're configured for big end forward. it's in the number 3 window, and it is the ltc camera."
0kay_
roger. 01 i0 32 51 cc roger. we see a real display now.
"houston, are you still there?"
okay. we'll consider ourselves tweaked.
"okay. mike is 111:03:30.00. over. 04 06 07 37 lmp-i_ okay. ccpy t2 would be pdi plus 24:54. and we have lima, 104:42:16.64; 111:03:30.00; november, 106:25:17.81. over."
"okay, off. and it was off at a minute and 8 seconds."
"yes, 22 seconds."
okay. we want alc to peak. and f/44.
"a 50-degree roll attitude will probably give us that, joe."
okay. why don't you look around a minute_ and i'll get that can.
"well, high is a relative term. i had to maintain quite a bit of pressure on it to keep from being turned, but i - i tried in the 1/6 g airplane several times to see if it was too high that - or that i could- if i couldn't hold it, and i could always hold it. and i can hold it here, even though the - the torque was fairly high."
"yes, it doesn't look like it rolled -"
"okay. you have to have four loops to do circ, huh?"
did that ruin it?
"okay, it looks like we're reading almost the same nowadays."
"yes, mine's good. okay. let me get to your front. l_4p-eva no, i didn't get your other arm here."
okay. go ahead. push it. imp-eva let me wait until it settles down here.
roger.
"it sure kicked up a lot of rocks. you - what are you going to do, go - go on the north side of it?"
gainstep is in up.
watch the crapping attitude.
"hey, that's pretty, fred."
"tranquility base, this is houston. co'mid we get both of you on the camera for a minute, please? 04 14 16 00 cdp say again, houston."
i'll hit it a few times so it'll stay up here for a few million years.
... okay.
pretty out. 03 11 h3 44 cmp eighteen minutes.
"roger, dave. and we've got that mark."
okay.
we're still getting -
"okay, bob. i never stopped doing what i wanted to do anyway even though a marine was talking."
i'll just let you make an assumption.
okay. 5·0.
"okay. after mapping camera - oh, wait a minute. stand by for the bell."

then we're ready for you guys to get back to the lm and dust it.

"okay, you speak."
"how are the pressures looking over there, jim? 03 06 35 04 i_p beautiful. about 170 on both."
"vhf b xmtr, off."
"as perhaps you can see from your camera, houston, the view off to the south is an undu2ating hill. and i would estimate that hill back there to the south is, oh, perhaps log feet higher than we are. 04 18 33 53 _ okay, al. i am ready to bring this down."
"say again, ken."
"yeah. in the sunlight, houston, this white rock has sort of a greenish hue to it, this white rock breccia. which is what all this is we're walking on right now is this white rock breccia that charlie chipped out of - charlie chipped out of - and i guess this is probably the second layer up. i would reckon that this - if - if we could see to the bottom, we could say for sure if this big black rock is right out of the bottom. but my guess from the old photograph, is probably is."
roger. and i have mapping camera photo pad and some further flight plan updates when you are ready to copy.
"well, it wasn't dust covered. well, we missed it. but things really fly up here - i'm amazed."
"- - so that - here's the tv; here's the flag - i'll step back here, and you can put it - step over here, then you go around, and we salute it...."
"that will be in the pans, geno."
"roger. we'd like to see the laser altimeter, off at this time, and you can follow up on the rest of those things per the flight plan; closing - retracting the mapping camera, et cetera, and closing the cover."
okay. (no comm for 15 minutes)
"and there's some beautiful north overhangs all around the block. well, (laughter) on the north side of the block."
"roger. mike, when you were playing with the p37 a while ago and we collapsed the deadband back down, the dap assumed that the deadband was centered around the new attitude that we happened to be at, at that time. since then, we've drifted out a couple of degrees in both pitch and yaw from that attitude such that if we did the procedure as we called it up to yo_ of going accel command, turning on all of the ajto rcs select switches and then rate command_ it would attempt to fly back to the pitch and _aw atti- tude that it had when the deadband co]lapsed. we can prevent that by - just immediately prior to going to rate command on the 5ta_nua1attitude switches, if you cycle the spacecraft control switch to scs, then back to cmc. over. 01 08 40 13 cm_ sounds like a winner. 0i 08 40 14 cc okay. 01 08 40 33 cm} i'm not going to let these lm guys plsy with my dsky an_nore."
okay. we're clear?
"falcon, we have a noun 43s."
0ops. excuse me.
"(yelling) okay, al. we're going to extend the landing - -"
good show.
okay.
"okay, houston, we're _muing through the dps throttle check. i got 12, 51, and 100. charlie's got lb, 51, and 100. 04 00 2b 16 lmp feels good. looks bad. darn thing."
"okay. go ahead, read which ones wetre going to get."
okay. sounds good. that's what we'll do then. 05 09 11 xx begin lunar rev 23
save - save the film changing here. let me get you a bag.
"joe, can you stand by for a minute on that. we wouldn't want our lmp to miss it."
do you acknowledge that?
"yes. well, do you want to put that in now or wait?"
roger. we're watching it.
"no, don't bend into the tunnel - the forward."
"not bad. did real well, dave."
t}_at's correct. next step: wait 30 minutes for preconditioning.
and 521 is the sample bag.
"okay, charlie, number 5, houston. you ready to go still, charlie?"
"jim, this is houston. while you're being loaded up there, can you glance over and see - confirm for us that the lrv bat covers have closed automatically?"
... 01 08 12 00 c_ - - utility power is on. okay.
okay.
was there a sleigh with it? lmp-_m wise guy.
no.
do they want - okay.
i'm squared away when they ... - -
"are they all complete, or do they have pieces missing also?"
"roger, jim. we'll have a handover from hawaii to goldstone in about 30 seconds."
fine.
"i think the superfine job is the two of you; it was just most remarkable. everybody down here is still _:fl0ati_ng so high, they're havlng a hard time getting down to all that data you gave us. and, you'll be interested to know that - that we have sitting in front of us, a preliminary report from each eva of the geology of the area that i would say is more complete than our 90-day preliminary reports which -- were issued on some of our other landings. it's just most exciting."
what does it say on the checklist about getting dse tape to the ...? is there anything more than turn the tape off?
okay.
"well, not unless - let me see, let me brush your - bend over. you don't have a brush to brush off. okay, no flags."
that's negative; houston wants them to stay locked on right now.
"sure wish you'd hurry up and get that trash ol,t out of there, though."
mark. deploy.
okay. i'm on - -
"john, why don't you take the rake right here in front of the - the - gnomon - i've already docu- mented that area - and see what you get?"
"jim, request verify ra_ging function switch is in ranging. we need that, if it's not there now."
"oh, that's all right."
"okay, you can turn around. oh, man, what have you been in? hallelujah."
"okay, the old central station is all cleaned up."
copy that.
"okay, you got it coming great. okay. you're going to have to come right a little bit - lef_ a little bit. clear your '_lss."
"okay, down in the middle of the page on line 9, we're just going to strike out the ""activate vhf for comm checks,"" and line 10, ""verify the dse."" we're going to leave the dse off, and that's to save power, as is the vhf activation."
"well, hell, you shouldn't have done that. 04 13 19 43 _p it was perfect."
i guess. re says it's down in the mud; it's less than 2 amps.
"we're going slew. r 07 03 17 26 cc falcon, houston. handover complete. verify auto, please."
"picard, i think, is the one i'm looking at. yes, it is. yes, and i can see peirce now just - behind the rendezvous antenna - or radar. and - yes, way out there, you ought to start seeing them."
"and roger on the - roger on the rates, too."

yes.

what's that?
"roger. 04 14 56 30 _ and the manual deployment of the lr cubed, the little spring that is at the end of the string is pulled off of the picks head. however, i was able to reach up and get hold of the picks head and pull it loose. so, it will be deployed manual- ly, also."
"look at these little crystals in it. no, that couldn't be. a big, white, angular rock and it's - but all the crystals in it are very small. ·that - that is a crystal rock. we're gonna get that one. that's the first one i've seen here that i really believe is a crystal rock, houston."
surprise.
... can't add the numbers in.
give me one.
"good show, fredo. thank you."
indexing to 6 here for trench bottom.
charge battery a. roger.
that's right. go ahead.
"roi1, yaw, roll, pitch, and yaw."
okay. go.
"okay, the lcru brush is stowed. okay. power on tv is going to off, houston."
okay. roll left 15.
okay.
"hey, bob, here you had any more charge firings on the surface?"
probably is - this large depression off to our left?
"purge valves, one, locked. okay. let me put the bootees on here. 05 22 05 52 cdr-l_ the purge valve is locked. 05 22 05 55 lmp-hm water connector, locked."
i was just turning my checklist pages.
we must have gotten some horrendous spike on some ...
"i think i might have. i think i might have bothered that one instead of the other one. they're both the same. i don't know, shit. i don't remember it, but i was handling the camera -"
thank you.
"yeah. okay, going to command module - -"
"okay, understand hold for instructions from msfn. is that before the power, on?"
the commander doesn't think that i can see the engine bell on that thing.
"water sep component light, on?"
"#** in a second. okay. yours is just laying there, too."
okay.
"okay, houston. endeavour's coming up over picard, and i thought i'd just go ahead and talk while we're going over pieard. first, talking about the color variations, picard is a slightly different color than the rest of the mare basin. it's - i guess what i would consider crisinm - a light brownish gray. picard, itself, is - is - is more of a brown tone, and it has a darker halo around it. i can see some of the brown - material just on the outside of the rim; and outside of that is some darker material that gradually turns into gray of mare crisis. inside picard, i can see - well, let's see now, let's count them - one, two, three, four, five, si - six distinct rings that go around the inside of picard. and the - and the walls in picard are very shallow. it looks like a very shallow, almost like a - a dish - kind of basin, and gently from the edges on in toward the center; and, as i say, i can count - five or six rings inside that are all concentric with the center of the basin. and i can see some definite layering in - in the - particularly in the upper boundary of the rim. now, as opposed to - to - oh, let's - let's say lick - lick is - lick looks like it's almost completely obscured - feature, now. it - it looks very much like a - collapse. all i can see is a little bit of a - of a ring, a color variation, with some positive relief. and then, inside the crater looks very much like outside - crater, as - far as the color and the texture is concerned. however, it does appear to slope gently in towards the center. looks - lick looks to me like a very large collapse feature, with the same kind of ma- terial both inside and outside the basin."
"okay, houston, frame 163 aridi64 ann i65 were taken of the mud craters and smy_hii, and 166, i guess, was taken of the great slopings - side of the crater in crisium. that's just sou_h of yerkes."
"go ahead. read that to me, ... pete."
got up to 90.
we've got a zillion particles.
"okay, liouston."
"roger, dick. los 108:56:58 ---"
"yes, i'm going to try to do that. it's really not part of our operation, but you can't go wrong doing it."
"main bus ties, two, on, fred. 0kay. sps helium valve, two, auto and checked auto barber pole. tvc servo power is l, ac1/main a; 2, ac2/main b."
"okay, karl, this is apollo 15. if the rates still look good down there, we're ready to go to ptc."
okay. the - i need to find out if the condensate container that we were going to use to strain some water in on the lunar surface - is that con- tainer also completely airtight? okay to use it to put i'luid in through here in zero g?
"and, dave, are you driving now? f- 06 01 07 04 cdr-eva no, joe. i'll give you a call, joe. stand by."
"okay, ken. i've got a film story for you. if you choose to do the earthshine, use mag xx and window 4 and the target should be about - you should see it about 122:42. if you don't do the earthshine, you can go ahead and use xx for 30 - the zodiacal. if you do the earthshine, of course, with the xx, you need the yy per flight plan for the zodiacal."
"okay. that rock - that clast - white clast - i looked at it, and it has a light, pastel-green - fairly rounded crystals in a fine-grained white to light pinkish-tan matrix. and you can figure that one out. looks like olivine and something."
servo powers are off. got the residuals killed.
"17, do you read houston? over."
okay.
and proceed - - 02 08 53 19 l_ okay - - 02 08 53 2¢) cc - - ny last copy is secondary rad in.
okay.
"okay, is our inlet temperature of the radiator - and the outlet, ... flight plan?"
hold the camera.
okay; lunar sounder cassette bag is in the eva bag.
"yes, we - we've got the fronts. the leading edge of the front on our prog was past korea and on japan, and you've got it moving quite a bit further east there."
"and, before you ntart working on it let l'43]<_)w. because we've got some deltas to the battery charging procedure."
had a water ...
go ahead.
what was that? real time exercise?
"roger, al. copy. 04 21 39 57 _ same - main concern here, there's just a lot of dust on top of the box and the electronics there. just hope it doesn't bother it too much."
"... out of the way, and i wonder what that's from."
roger. they'll hear that.
it's off.
1201. (eagle)
"okay. that's most of it. 06 05 02 04 i_mp-eva how did your front get so dirty? oh, i know. pulled an irwin."
"okay. let's get the residuals. okay, houston, there are the residuals."
that's very appropriate. i re_ember that being played one other time after a tei burn.
mark.

thank you.
"dave, just out of curiosity, we know you or a1 - -"
okay. 04 l0 40 bb lmp-lm okay. i'm reading b.4. that's 2/10ths in a minute.
"okay. i'm doing some useful work, like getting that tv camera going."
go ahead.
okay. magazine ss is full.
yes.
"roger, ron. we'll give you a call. you can go on to bravo now, ron."
"okay; the weather here is real nice. houston and vicinity was fair all day and tonight. becoming partly cloudy wednesday. warm afternoons, cool again tonight the paper says. high today was in the upper-80s, low tonight in the upper-50s, and high wednesday in the mid-8os. and dry, cool air prevailing over most of the u.s. and of more immediate interest, the weather in the recovery area is excellent and forecast to stay that way."
jan said she's - you're the last person she would ever think would miss a meal up there.
"oh, is this easy to do in 1/6 gravity."
"roger, charlie."
"well, that's what it's for. oh, that's a mou - oh, man, would that be ... - -"
"ail right. like to take main bus ties, two of them, on and up. that's probably a verify."
how's that?
"we don't have the dsky. you have to read it to us, ron."
when?
"no, we advanced, there's no film in ... the film's in it; pull it up."
roger.
"oh, you don't want to hear. let me figure some times out here. that's at 79, and what are we at now? about - do we - do we - do we even know any better computer time, do we?"
"apollo 15, houston. over."
oh. ail right. i see what you're talking about.
354 for 3.4.
okay. we'll send ed over there to look at it.
"yeah. you can make out an outline now, ken."
do you feel all right? you okay?
"ron, if you were in the simulator right now, i'd have you adjust your mirrors."
no mtvc.
that's good. i can reach it.
"*** get a dustbrush, and let's check our camera."
"okay, it'll be 3 - -"
"hello, gordo. request is that i handle the dis- ciplinary problems up here; how's that?"
...
that's affirmative.
okay.
"okay. panel 4: telcomm, group 1 will go off. panel 5: all the circuit breakers that we closed will go back to open."
"that's what they say. yes, that's right."
"right. the - at these low sun angles, there's no trace of brown, it's now returned to a very gray appearance and, like the 8 crew says, it has a look of plaster of paris to it at this sun angle, which is completely lacking in ..."
this one?
"ron, houston. we'd like you to move up and do the waste water dump starting now and the 02 fuel cell purge. i_mp okay, we'll get to that and mag quebec quebec is on frame 50."
okay. we're going to probably need numerics lighting. there you go. you got it.
"ll, this is houston. we've completed the uplink; the computer is yours; you can go back to block."
"... yet. 00 02 13 27 _p yes, but i don't want to - be ready to take a pic- ture and miss a picture because of it."
yes.
me're only 3 degrees away from him.
"we'll keep up with you yet there, jack. say, you may be interested. we've got 9 hours of good tracking on the - after the midcourse - and we show a perilvane of about 52 miles which confirms a good midcourse."
"shouldn't we, charlie?"
"okay. pericynthion plus 2, sps/g&n; 66373, 1 - plus 1.18, minus 0.14; 090:49:55.82; plus 1787.5, minus 1891.7, minus 2396.8; 237, 126, 332; rest of pad is na; sirius and rigel; 122; 354; 000. no ullage. remark l, burn docked; 2 is loi refs_iat assumed."
"okay. okay, pete. why don't - would you carry the handtool carrier down there?"
roger. we still want an activation start time for a burn.
"okay. suit gas diverter, pull/egress."
roger. apollo 16 air-t0-ground voice transcription
that is a major task.
"80-millimeter. k_p okay. c_ f/ltat1/500. five frames over the terminator, huh?"
roger. it looked good here also. 07 16 31 57 l_-lm okay; syst_ a quad 4 talkback still sticky.
copy that.
i ... so.
"okay. for your information, the lm troops are in the middle of the seva now, and dave is standing up in the hatch and taking the panoramic pictures."
"okay, and ever so often, i see a particle come out from that region at some accelerated velocity, like it's leading the spacecraft."
"yes, i don't go to the - -"
"yes, i tell you, our - our suits were pretty ... yesterday, but ... 06 07 58 36 cdr-i_ very well. holding up real good. 06 07 58 _2 cdr-lm well, the rover is doing absolutely super. we were going up the side of that mountain like ... 06 07 58 5_ cdr-lm yes, it's a - really a super fine machine."
"okay, 30k, yaw to zero."
...
"orion, do you read casper? orion, do you read casper?"
"..., john."
go ahead.
they're all alined and damped out?
"and, zero, zero, zero."

do you want a sample ...
that a boy. confidenti
the large gray one to your right with large vesicles in it.
"hey, you got something pretty good in there, don't you?"
my gloves are off.
"stand by, ron."
"okay. that is ice, by the way, jack. 05 18 00 b5 cdr-eva *** at 4.5. but i am out here on the porch."
"okay. thank you, charlie."
"roger that, jim. we are trying to get the procedures finished and up to you as quickly as we can. they exist. what's going on now is the guys are running them in the cms/les, integrate, to make darn sure that the attitudes are correct and the time line is nice and re- is.xed and all that good stuff. and they won't be finished that run for another few hours. however, we expect to have an overall time line and a sequence of events for you before that time, and we'll start with the procedures as soon as they get ready. over."
yes. i'm going to write it on a ... here.
okay.
"doing just fine, but it's back to end-to-end, and i've got much in motion."
"i}kay. abort stage is set,. starting ullage. 6, 5, 4, - onfidenti,ii 6 05 22 30 47 cdr/lmp pro."
"try aft omni again, jack."
roger.
"okay, gordy. that's the highgatn. how do you like it?"
is that right? ...
"okay, do that. oh boy, i tell you, this place is full of holes, houston. and rocks."
"okay, we'd like to make the azimuth 98."
okay. is it now?
roger. we're watching.
"okay, i'm not sure - it seemed to me like they gave us bum dope on this 100 hours."
we're venting something. maybe it's the steam duct.
okay.
"roger. this was in about the last, oh, 30, 40 minutes."
"boy, are you - you got your pockets completely filled with dirt."
"okay; thank you. the computer is ours. b_ roger. 10 i0 42 21 i2_t houston, 17."
"okay, aquarius; houston. request po0 and data for a data load. over."
"if you're not using the optics, we suggest you zero them; they're - we notice them drifting."
"course that's after the hatch integrity check. if we want to go ahead and run through the full hatch integrity check, then we'd run up to 3.5 and then run another l0 minutes, i guess. 07 l0 02 h8 cc yes, that's the point, dave. we want to run a complete ha - hatch integrity check; in fact, we'll proba - we may ask you to run it longer than usual."
waiv until he gets the sleee out of his eyes.
"sure will, ron."
"okay. we're all three ail sensored, ready to go. if they have a problem, let's get it squared away right now."
"roger. on the x-ray spectrometer, the work you've been doing on the galactic sources of x-radiation has - is already showing considerable interest. and, in particular, the scorpius x-ray i data gives us a longer continuous observation of - of this source than we've ever had before and shows a fairly long-period variation, whi - which - i - with - i should put in a word of caution - which still might be instrumental, but looks real, and was previously unrecorded and has the - has dr. adler rather ex- cited. and i'm sure the other as - astronomers will be much interested also. indeed, we may go back to that source later today, although i don't think that 's clearly decided yet."
"that's affirmative. now at 77:50, ""verb 48 21101 01111."
"i_d_-dingantenna to auto. 04 01 05 24 i_p okay. radar test, landing."
"roger. i'm configured now at ... for bd roll, and i have thrusters c4 and b3 turned off, and i copy register 1 61102 01111 and lm weight 5785. thank you."
okay. yeah. ems mode to normal.
"yeah, i think you ought to just use - your scoop or something for a gnomon."
"go ahead, houston."
"roger. mcc-7, rcs/g&n; 27276; noun 48 is na; noun 33, 287:23:00.26; minus 0001.4, plus all zips, plus four balls 1; 180, 310, 000; ha is na, plus 0021.7; 0001.4, 0:04, 0001.4; sextant star 13, 312.7, 33.7; boresight star na; noun 61, minus 00.71, minus 156.18; 1045.8, 36276; 290:23:59. sirius and rigel; 279, 045, 014. four jets. remarks: ems not bias for drift. high gain angles, pitch, minus 85; yaw, 119. end of pad, and the computer is yours."
"okay; and, jack, we're getting ready here to try and save a little bit of time. and we're saying that why don't we just take two stereo pans for the alsep photos. first stereo pan will be in the vicinity of the original stereo pan; and the second one, they suggested, will be to the north- west - of that original one."
"hey, john. let me put number 7 on - on your - try it again on your side."
plus or minus 9; that's a 24.
"no, i can't punch it until i get out of here."
"okay. we copy that, charlie."
the dial is 280. the thumbwheel is 270.
three minutes and a half.
"ok_f. flag kit, unstow sample bag, left-hand stowage compartment, temporarily stow in aft cabin under netting."
"say again there, jack."
roger.
"hello, 11. houston. we got a view of the plss there, off the right of our screen."
"let's see, the area is pretty well policed up over there. i'll - when i come back to get the core tubes, i'll pick it up."
yes.
"bob, i just probably ought to qualify, all those remarks about the earth's weather. it's purely novice talking about something he is very un- familiar with, except for having a longstanding interest in it. and i think the one philosophical point, if any, that comes out of it is that some- body, probably 3-1/2 billion years ago or so, could have looked at the earth and described patterns not too dissimilar. and it was within those patterns that life developed, and now you see, i think, and obvious to everybody, what that life has progressed to doing. and i certainly think all of us feel that it has not stopped doing that progression, and we'll probably see it do things that even you and i can't imagine them doing. i certainly hope so."
"... houston, for that check. observe - do you still want the v}{fa, vhf b, off, on the imp panel? 04 17 03 12 imp understand that. you're in a, t/r and b, receive, right?"
"okay, ron."
okay. i guess the free kills the jet monitor.
"okay, we'll use - we'd like to use ounces, and that's what we'll go with."
"okay. 4.4. yes sir. 00 03 49 1] cc okay. and you want to know if you can go ahead and use additional oxygen to bring the command module up to 5.0 and continue the equalization? over.

"0kay_, charlie - - charlie, could you say the voids again?"
that's affirm.
"okay, good. the component light, we won't have the h20 sep. okay, on cb(16) right under that, ""heater display, close,"" you can scratch that out. perform all of step 2 and perform step 4 with the following changes. on panel ll, under ac bus b, are you ready to copy? over."
that just makes it more interesting.
"roger. stand by a minute, jim. our signal strength is getting a little iow. we may have a recommendation."
"no, we ... _lp oh (laughter). 07 21 08 33 _4p you guys you got any - sample bags you can mut in a-97 _p say again."
mark.
"50 minutes? oh, thought you meant 50 minutes to the burn."
"say again there, gene."
roger. same here. we're - we're still discussing the next move.
"okay, 46,000 at 72 - 46."
"i don't know, but it's taken a couple better than this."
mark. 03:30 until the burn.
okay. we got only y.
that's true (laughter).
"okay. at 58, we want a noun 62 em scs/tvc serv0 power to 1, ac i/main a, and 2, off. and, a1 bean, you give me a tape recorder? high bit rate, record, forward, and a command reset."
"can you go to the right, john? there's a pretty fresh batch, dead ahead. that's about a tenth of a kilometer across there, though; that's a big crater right there."
yes. help me get it with the scoop. that a boy.
"you've got a lot of healthy weather out there in the pacific today. looks like most of those things we talked about yesterday, up in the hawaii region and also in the south, have intensified."
"i think the explosion, from what i could see, joe, had - had stained it. i don't knew whether it did any actual deformation or not."
... - -
"okay, at 20, it'd be about 290:02, but make it 03."
yes. it's all alined. we're all ... - -
...
"houston, we were not calling. (t_3q)"
all right. i got all that. thank you.
"roger. you $re about four-by with a slight decrease/increase in volume, sort of a wavy volume to it. over. 0! 09 53 09 lmp okay. i moved my mike around. how about now? is this any better?"
the point is my hands will be much better off without them.
"roger, houston."
yes. yes. 04 23 21 15 lmp-i_ okay; i'll get it. okay; it's stowed.
we do uv photos twice. two more - uv photos two more times.
okay.
"okay, jack. we'd like you to try the high gain at a pitch of minus 29, yaw 17, manual and wide."
okay. a is going to cabin. i got a rise.
... what 3 really is.
"no, we weren't having a competition. we were just showing you some of the things you could do with a 360-pound mass that only weighs 60 pounds, even slowed down, if you will, by the pressure suit. and i don't think anybody won. we were just demonstrating what you can do with the suit."
how many frames in the next nikon mag do i have to diddle with?
"yes, better cut those lights off again."
_y _don'tyou let me use it while you're doing that?
okay. let me check mine.
"yeah; but - course, i - yeah, i forgot us - about us being uncoupled."
"yeah. okay. let me get you off - out of this thing. uh-oh. can you get up like this a little? there it goes - undo that ... okay, would you keep the - keep that hose out of the duct."
"you better believe, that old service module has taken good care cf us. we want to take good care of it."
"that's correct, jim. now looking at page 3-378, the ""ltvphotos - transearth coast,"" a couple of changes there. about halfway down the page where it reads ""two frames, filter 2, exposure time 20 seconds,"" delete that line, and add the line - the t_o lines, ""one frame, filter 2, exposure time 20 seconds; one frame, filter 2, exposure time 2 seconds."""
okay. 07 00 00 35 lmp-_ elt [?]
that's what it says.
"boy, i tell you these little _s - plsss are really superfantastic."
the old man wrinkled face on the - -
didn't use any of the - we didn't use any of the uv film yesterday - that's magazine oscar oscar. magazine sierra sierra reads 20 frames. i'm just going to have to go through the film locker here and pull out mags and tell you what's on them.
it sure does.
h_?
"still have the three core tubes in there, two bag dispense rs."
"15, this is houston. your spinup is looking very good to us, and when you have a couple of minutes to listen, we have a brief status report to send up to you."
okay; 11841.
"the only thing that's bothering me are all those engine, you know. jesus, they were grinding to a halt. 07 21 23 41 _ they sure were ...."
"okay, engine arm is descent. i think the tapemeter drove. i'm not sure."
"roger. you ought to be coming up on a terminator now. is that right? pretty close to it? 04 10 28 58 cml° yes, sir. my view is disappearing rapidly."
"jack, i got a quick agricultural explanation of the problem. (laughter) evidently, it's the two plates betweenwhich the beam itself is suspended are adjustable, so that - by ground command, so that by driving these plates back and forth, they try to center the beam between them. and then the - the data is initiated. when the beam vibrates be- tween the plates, it changes capacitance, or at least that's the general principle. and the problem is that by drive, they can comae-nd the plates back and forth and stop the stop, but they cannot get the beam to leave - leave one of the plates. it just is hung up agains$ one plate, and this would - could be caused by one of the wires that's sus- pended - sort of hang the beam, pendulum-fashion, being broken so that it has cockeyed off to one side. i guess that's the best guess as to the malfunction at the moment. it's presently in use as a seismometer returning data in that mode, but useless in its prim-wyintended data-taking mode. over."
stand by 1.
"lcg water pump sounds like a diesel truck running out here. comforting to know that it's running. i'm off to get the battery. 04 19 35 09 ip5° okay. i think i know what happened, houston. i think i know what happened."
roger.
"okay. i just turned my flow back on, so it'll start to rise again."
good morning. is everybody wide awake and feeling great this morning?
"roger, al. verify that on your last p52 you used option 1."
"mark, john."
"that's correct, and at 149 hours and 37 minutes, we do the same thing."
okay.
"yeah, we can do that. the time on that is 155:36 and you've got about six or seven lines; you might want to come out to the left there."
my shorthand is rather poor today.
"get in there, baby. okay. 05 12 04 26 _p okay, fredo. on high scale again; x, 01.i - hold it."

i'm going to go down this way.
that's correct.
"that sun is just bright. i ought to put those visors down, i suppose - those other visors. okay. let me take a look at my list and see whether i've got everything. measured, measured; height, height; you've got all the shields; you're coming out south; verify heat flow is level and aligned - it is aligned and gnomon was good; uht to the lrv lmp seat; and then what do i do? let me see. deep core prep. jack, i'm going to leave the uht in the heat flow in case you need it. i24p-eva okay."
"jim, this is houston. over. 05 18 16 34 i24p-i_ go ahead, gordo."
"yeah, that's probably what it was, 8, 9, l0 - yep, there's a cyclic accumulator; hmm. okay."
that's correct.
i can't put that back in.
"okay, b simplex."
no.
"how about the ga/_4a ray gain switch? snap it _ three times for us, please, al."
"what we're doing this for is to get a readout of the film quantity. c_4p oh, i see."
"casper, high gain on the auto - auto on the high gain. 05 05 52 o0 cml° sure can."

"roger, buzz. that's a great shot now that we're getting of the helmet, the eva visor, and also the -the eva gloves in the background."
okay. you have it.
and we got the i_mtransmitter lights ... out.
thank you.
... this thing ...
roger. we copy mag mike mike on 172.
do you have a bag for it?
"houston, i hate to tell you this, but those rocks, these light ones here, they look like caliche to me."
that's what i mean. but this - -
what kind of pressure do you have now?
"okay, john."
"okay, but we were talking about the helmet bag, not the leva bag. we - we weren't going to use the leva bags."
it's supposed to sound that way.
"to put this update in simple terms - at 65, i guess on our clocks, you'll update us to about 67:40, right?"
roger. you're lost without the gnomon.
"okay_ for the pgns: plus 70.3, plus 5.9, minus 17.7. for the ags: ""pius 70.4, plus 5.9, minus 19.1. the cmc: minus 69.1, minus 6.1, plus 16.1. we burned the pgns on time, and we had about a 4- foot-per-second overburn on the aps, which we trimmed out to 2/10ths."
"okay, and those are the numbers."
"twenty-one minutes to .05g; 23 ... 24 - yep, that all looks pretty - pretty reasonable. shall we?"
"houston, what time is los?"
okay.
okay. *** fairly subdued craters now. age llconft t . ay6
they are open.
"roger, ken. and did you happen to notice the re- tract time on the mapping camera."
"yeah. i don't - i don't think there's any relation between any of these failures, one to another. i don't know. i don't think there's any common thread. i agree with ken; it's very complicated gear. it has to run for long periods of time, and you've got to expect some times that it won't run, and you got to know how to fix it. and that's why they send us on these trips."
"apollo 11, houston. good morning."
here's a football-size rock that was 50 percent varied.
"okay, you sound good to us. just a reminder that rendezvous transponder does not go to power there. we just keep it in heaters."
"okay, dave. and your nav system should be zeroed, and we're looking for a range distance reading, which you know."
"okay, ken, if you'll give us low altitude on the v over h override."
"okay. well, part of our power-saving program is to - not have the ac powered up, on the surface. 04 08 h6 42 lmp-lm okay. that's fine."
"oh! oh, look at that! isn't that - holy smokes. have you ever seen anything like that?"
"john and charlie, this is houston. you copy?"
"yes, sir."
i don't know what causad it.
"},_&znbus ties are off."
okay; it's retracting now.
"yes, why don't you pump it up again to 3.7."
"roger. and, you can go with reading."
"you put the camera away, didn't you? oh, that's all right. what have you got?"
"- - update to csm - ti and t2 times for fra mauro photographs. update to csm; tei 34 pad, map update rev 11, csm dap pad, comm attitude, and high gain. uplink to csm; state vector, verb 66 - -"
"houston, endeavour. '?'j.r""_ _3/'3 f'_,.f_c_632"
... push the button. now hold that down.
"well, when i find the moon, i'm going to know where the horizon is. it'll be just below it."
"okay, zap me with it, and go ""0"", and then put your audio breaker open and connect the lm comm. then on audio breaker closed. okay?"
okay.
roger. rate command. and the pyros are armed.
"okay; well, are you - no. hey, ken, if you - you're in great shape. why don't you go get it, and we'll - watch it."
i got it on this side.
"you need more slack, buzz? (trg_nq) 04 13 20 40 ijvip no. hold it just a minute. (mm_q) 04 13 20 _1 cdr okay. (tranq)"
"oh, my, yes!"
"okay, al. would you do one other thing, then? pick the camera up and invert it. maybe give it a shake or two and see if we can get anything. 04 22 39 51 imp will do. it's upside down and i'm shaking it now. i still am a little concerned about this plug on the back of the camera; it looks - doesn't look exactly copacetic. it looks like it's cracked a little bit, - the ... material, and it looks like it could have melted or something. there might be a problam right in the wiring _here. okay, i've shaken it andwhat have you. i'll hold it upside down just for a few minutes. i can feel the motor running."
"roger. as you know, we're going to do this on lm power, so this reflects that."
"okay. yes, i'll make a little note there, and we'll discuss it when we get everything copied, huh?"
"well - that didn't get done, jun - joe. we'll - i'll pick it up - remind me after i get the - lr cubed on the rover, joe; i'll do that."
"we're going over minnez - meinesz or something like that, which is just off to my left."
"okay, stand by. okay, boost/en -"
"okay. right down here. both mikes are repositioned, %confiden't'l m day"
"hello, houston; america."
"gosh, this is mag - oh, look at those pretty stars. look at that. oh."
"charlie, you're so strong."
"i'm reading 136 - make that 132 on battery number 2, and we did get a flag."
"challenger, houston."
"okay, houston. i think you have a picture of her now. there she is."
okay. the - the rim of - -
"gee, i can see condensation in here."
ll60.
"here you go. no, no, not there. here - you've got it."
okay. you're right. that's an error on our part. just cancel out our addition.
roger. houston copies.
"and, dave, you're setting a new outdoor record with each toss there."
roger. they said they expected that because the extra time on the pad that they're running. that 2-hour-and-40-minute delay is coming into play again.
stop push buttons are reset.
"roger. stsad by. 00 il 18 08 cdr houston, apollo 11] _he battery chargi lg is com- plete, and the crew status report is as follows: radiation, cdr 11002, cmp 10002, lmp 09003; negative medication; fit as a fiddle, over."
"apollo 15, houston. over."
you hate to look at in the daytime.
"uh-huh. up to relief, right?"
maybe we can turn the plss 02 off at 2-1/2.
"roger. that's correct. step l0 is, ""configure circuit breaker panels per activation 3 and 4."""
i just want to - -
"okay, dick, tvc serv0 power - ac i/main a."
can you reach it?
"it just looks like slump, probably."
that's affirmative.
"(laughter) well, you got to - you got to be fas% on your feet. and we're 168 above the rescue redline."
you're at that time in the flight plan where you should be able to get it and we should be able to get our pcm data.
"roger, jim. we will."
any ... loose limits?
"280, 120, and 040."
"well, a couple of them looked to me like they had some very light *** crystals in them. see that?"
"not yet. g , · _i_ '._o_j __:._.."
i'll get it to you. okay. there you go.
okay.
ail right. it might - -
okay.
come on in.
"sounds good, gordy. we'll just take her slow and easy when i get over there today and make sure we understand it."
good gravyl you know how big that rock -
okay.
yeah.
"we can probably put it over the left there, john. tony, i looked out - down to about 4000 feet, assessing north ray area. there were some large blocks, maybe 5 percent of the surface up around the rim, but as you look back towards palmetto, they really petered out in a hurry, and i think we're going to be in good shape going that way."
those craters up there.
go ahead. i'll copy it down.
"okay. for eugene cernan and any other later com- ments. you talked a lot about this mission being the end of the beginning, but a lot of people don't agree. recognizing the united states is stopping lunar exporation for the forseeable future, how do you feel?"
they're great.
"okay. and i was about to say the lm jettison pad is similar to the sm sep pad, fred, when you're ready to copy. 05 16 12 l_2 lmt_ jtu_t about the same nun,ber of lines? 05 16 ]2 44 cc yes."
"that should take only a verb 49, since we've already loaded it."
okay. ken says he looked at it several times during the evening and it's been there most of the night.
"no, we can't - we can't pronounce it either. i think you'll enjoy that. they make a fine brand of cheese."
there seems - yes.
"good readback, al. ['age280"
dick does - - 00 02 0t 53 lmp ...
"no, we aren't. we're okay."
yes.
"okay. and next step, panel 12: s-band function to voice and ranging function to hanging."
yes.
there's a b_nch° why don't you open it?
yes.
"and i went right through that 100 feet per second, that's all."
and there's one before that that came off jim's bag rack.
shoot !
"okay, fine. 05 23 12 00 i24p-eva joe, i'm going to start the camera here. will you keep track of it? i'm on 12 frames per second."
"it's in the bag. son of a bitch, babe, ... i'm going to push in that button."
"okay, verify suit pressure stable, 3.5 to 4.0."
"oh' here, dave."
okay. there you go.
say again.
"hello, apollo 112 houston. we've got a load for you, if you give us po0 and accept. the load consists of a csm pre-tei state vector that's going in the csm slot, and a post-tei state vec- tor that'll go into the lm slot, if that's okay; and also a tei target load. any comments? over. 05 13 53 07 c_ip very good. thank you very much."
"okay. jack has turned off ring 1 that was on main a, and he's still reading 30.2 volts."
"okay, that's deleted. okay."
... 60.9 by 9....
no_ we've still got one going.
"yes, okay."
"and you say everything else is okay, huh?"
"yeah, charlie; 5 to 10. more like 10. 06 22 24 _3 _,_-eva yeah. okay, tony. we're about maybe a half-a- crater diameter to the northeast of - of palmetto, about a 10-degree slope, and the boulder population is about 5 degrees here. and the small cobbles have just about disappeared. very smooth regolith, except for these 20- to 30-centimeter boulders, which are not very numerous. we're really moving out downslope at about 12, 15 kilometers an hour."
"okay, stand by."
"oh, man. that is dusty."
i've gone through b.5 now - 3.4 really.
"(laughter) no wonder that was such a long - hank, we got another one of those event timers that times at some pace other than universal time. but don't worry about the meed; we've got a watch on it."
okay. verify it was locked. 09 04 10 40 cml° it probably got another 5 seconds of exposure.
you have a call.
i was trying to get us a few still ones.
it's open.
okay.
"okay. under row 4: under heaters, your rcs quad heaters should - four of them - be closed, open displays, open s-band antenna, open sequence camera. under eps, open displays, close dc bus volt, open inverter 2, open ascent eca control and ascent eca, close descent eca, descent eca control, translunar bus tie, close cross tie bal loads, open cross tie bus, close bat feed ties. over."
"yes. and, let's see, we want the hasselblad 80 millimeter, intervalometer--"
that must be solar wind.
got it? 04 20 08 55 ia{p you want me to go work on something else now?
"well, i guess we weren't aware we had that many problems. i thought this was a rather troublefree flight, myself. we went a long way, we spent a long time doing the job, and i think, relative to the number of systems we have in all the space- craft, that we had very few problems. i can think of none that were significant that would enable me to compare it with gemini viii at all. we had a - i guess the first little problem we had was a - a leak in our water system, which was cleared up rather rapidly by somebody having already done some investigation and having a procedure at hand. i believe our system is such that people have all the anticipated problems understood, and, when they have them understood, they come up with solutions which are quite meaningful and successful. and i feel like the spacecraft and the life-support systems on the moon and everything worked exceedingly well. i - i guess really i couldn't ask for much more. how about you?"
that has to be done from your couch there.
yes.
okay; standing by.
okay.
"standing by for some more instructions, houston."
ail right.
"boy, i'd love to give it to you; any way i could."
can you make it?
okay. and then we'll lower our protective visor and secure tool harness and self-doff straps.
"yes, i have a beef stew here."
what did he say?
"gordon, that was beautiful. tell flight and the guys down in the trenches, ""man, that was super!"""
"and the note there is - use the - use the lexan shield on cm-5; in other words, leave it on the window."
"well, great. looks good to us. we see the helmet storage bag."
what's your new logic?
"endeavour, houston. over."
let me give them a good check·
wait a minute.
"dave, this is houston. is the mesa deployed?"
no wonder i couldn't find it. i'd be over there looking for a month.
ail you had to do was close them anyhow and leave that crossfeed open.
okay. we copy that.
"dig that, man, it did work. it's working."
"are you in attitude hold? 04 09 05 20 cml° hey, pete."
"roger. and how about just reading that step back to ne there. l0 21 29 21 cml° okay. before calling p61, i'm going to reset the average-g flag with a verb 25 noun 7, 75 enter, i f3iter, and 0 enter. and i'll do that prior to calling p61."
"understand. the dap data is weight, 37679; pitch trim is 0.49; and yaw trim is 1.04. and do you have some signs on those?"
"and we got a good picture here, and we just saw you hop off."
yes.
"okay; this is a - looks like a darker, fine-grained, black, vesicular basalt, with vesicles on the order of millimeters. nonuniformly disb - distributed. there are a mass of plagioelase about 3 millimeters long, and it may be a half a millimeter wide, ran- domly oriented throughout. and that's about the only other mineral i see. and that - did you get the number on that, jim?"
"al, copy you have the side deployed."
"okay, ken, go ahead with your film status, and we're looking at that stowing the optics. 01 14 07 16 cml° okay, the _gazine 00 reads 26, magazine november novel)er is either 33 or 34, depending on how _ou look at it. we finished up the 16-millimeter mag on alfa alfa by taking some pictures of the - part of the lm paint that we think is shredding. maga- zine ()scar and november have been used just for the targeted pictures - no extras. and i guess that's - we didn't take any other original pictures today except for the aa frames on the i_. tomorrow we'll try to get some interior photography. 01 1_ 08 06 cc okay. copy 26 frames on oscar oscar. the november november report we got last night was 33 frames. you didn't use any of it today?"
"good eye, good eye. lmp-ev& big white clast - in the two-cy - in the gray- matrix breccia."
"071, 071 is the bearing."
twenty-one.
"suit fan delta-p, open, and suit fan number 2, open."
"and, dave and jim, basically the eva is going to last somewhere between _ and 5 hours, so it will ----- be a short eva. i'm told that we checked off the 100 percent science completion square sometime during eva-1 or maybe even shortly into eva-2. from here on out, it's gravy all the wef, and we're just going to play it cool, take it easy, and see some interesting geology. it should be a most enjoyable day. over. 06 16 17 ll cdr-ir okay, joe. thank you. we're looking forward to it. ·ape104/3 06 16 18 b2 i2_p-lm you do my ... here. 06 16 19 ob i_p-i_ probably want us to hit the rille for all that good rille photography."
that comes from 15 years as a trained - trained hammer bearer.
"that is off. okay, there's - - 05 10 43 11 _p ecs, yes, and water sep. okay. 05 10 h3 13 cdr okay, connect the ©ps 02 hose. blue to blue. 05 t0 43 28 cdr blue to blue and locked."
(laughter)
"204, azimuth; elevation 26."
"okay, we're heading now 250 to get over on the west side of dune."
... 902. last night ... that's what i figured would happen. 03 17 28 52 cml° it's about 5.1 - hasn't moved a hair.
"jack, we'd like you to verify the tape recorder, off. oh 14 50 12 lmp-lm yes, that's verified, gordy. l_°-lm gordy, how does the fuel vent look to you?"
roger. we figured it probably would be.
"do you want the gnomon? 05 13 37 23 3c okay. and, al, did - did you mention either' seeing a white boulder or a brown - a brownish-gray boulder earlier?"
look up - up left.
"why don't you just throw that whole mcdivitt purse, al? as a matter of fact, hand me that stuff, and i'll hold this for you, with these here. 06 02 40 31 i_mp but most of these have got to stay .... for the burn. sorry. okay ...."
okay.
okay. thank you.
"that's affirmative, jack. go ahead."
"okay, that's as good a way as any."
"negative. standby. we wanted to know - - 01 06 31 )6 cdr ... 01 06 31 j7 cc we wanted to know what numbers before _reasked them. 01 06 31 !2 cdr okay. i'm showing them the ds_f, and i'd like to know whether they can read what's showing on the dsky, and also whether they can see p-r-o-g, v-e-r-b, and n-o-u-n. over."
"roger. dave, that's exactly the picture we built from your verbal description there and that's the reason - one of the reasons we're going to omit station 3. we think that there probably is not at least a sharp debris flow down the side."
"roger, ken. we're doing that now."
"and, ron, this is camera path ends at bessel a - bessel alfa in the sea of - in serenity - serenitatis."
all right.
"okay, bruce. i think it has to do with the relay switch, as well. let's ignore that and go on for the moment .... of my keying."
okay. now you can see a few of the spark - sparkling particles going across the screen. those are being emitted from the thrusters. jack's maneuvering the spacecraft now.
huh?
we're on aft omni.
*** it's locked.
suit fan delta-p number 2. that ain't right.
"okay. it's 1, 2, 3 - looks like it's just slightly over 300."
okay.
that's it? you got one quad. that's all okay. everything's all right. ail the quads are gray.
"apollo 15, houston. it's retract time."
yes.
roger. guidance steering in the ags. (tranq)
"well, i can assure you you're not the only o_:c_ %ha% are pmeasea."
yes. go ahead.
... clock there .... would you like ...?
"fred-o, you - how about a bracket? o0 00 56 oh l_ well."
"okay, jim, it's 2 minutes ..."
roger.
"roger, dave. we copy. and we think you're bragging, but you have a reason to. beautiful burn."
"okay, gordo. we're ready to don the helmets and gloves."
"that's all of them for right now. thank you a lot, fellows."
i might get a mag.
"no, let's do it later - because i'd have to get off and get unstrapped and everything else .... get to the seatpan."
"yes, let's make ... i don't know ... a lot of ... no way it could be 1."
okay. i_p-eva i'm just trying to level - -
"yes, wait until next week, and we'll take a vacation."
righto.
roger; we understand.
"they got out and did a little riding around on the rover too, huh?"
"no. no, nobody's behind the sun to us."
"okay, and you did get the umbilicals, right?"
"i'm sorry, bob. i guess you - you didn't hear it. i - we're passed the end of the antenna and we're headed south or north - northeast."
"isn't that something. america, you look beautiful."
"that's a good place, charlie."
okay.
yeah; 25-1/2.
okay.
"and we're just finishing up an eat period, and looked around, and the spacecraft still looks good on board."
"okay, dave. i've got a recycle solution for you. roger. minus 69.4, minus 6.2, plus 12.0."
okay.
yeah.
take pictures of it. i don't have any film.
"13, we're not going to concern ourselves at the moment with a dps burn. it's going to be some time before we'd get to that; but we're working on other procedures to give you, which will allow us to use the lm systems. over."
copy that.
sounder to standby at 17.
that's correct. _goss net 1) tape 16/6
make that 7.
it's not working. there it goes. oh'
(laughter)
"okay; mighty fine. ll 12 02 b3 cdr houston, america."
stand by.
i can barely get the old fingers in them.
"okay, my pump's going on now."
go ahead.
"this is houston. thst plan sounds fin_ with us, neil."
6.9; 7.
"oh, houston, falcon. yes, we do have a little puddle of water back in the - behind the ascent - behind the engine cover. apollo15 air-to-grounvdoicetranscript_o_"
"okay, still holding at 2.0 on the delta-p."
roger. we'll give you a call just before we get off.
"that's affirmative. any time. and in case you're wondering -case you're wondering about that middle step, that's a reset to logic step by going off on the power and then back to power."
and vent flag.
"try going on the side there, geno."
you got one on inc0 that time. imp the first one.
"if i squat down, would it help?"
roger.
okay. you can go with the block data.
"yes, i am, dave."
no.
i've got to get around that -
look at that!
"okay; docking probe, extend/retract, and ta]_kback's gray."
"o-f-f. okay, etb contains two medium., football rocks and the small rocks from the somprehensive sample, contains two 70-millimeter c_2's, three 16-millimeter mags, map, lens/scribe/brush assembly. 0k 22 07 07 12,ip yes, vhey're all in there; i just check the:r.."
"jim, you want us to bring ascent bats on or wait until about 35 minutes?"
is it getting cool up there?
auto shutdown.
"roger, buzz. under the dps column on the pressure side, you go down to the fourth item, says pres- sure greater than 150 ptca should be greater than 65 percent. over."
ail right. you guys are doing pretty good. you're almost caught up.
okay.
i never have.
"oh, i forgot to say goodby to you, until we see you in a couple of days."
"oh, it ioesn't do a thin6. there's apparently just a little hit of polarizing done _y the win- dows. amd as i rotate the filter, why, it brightens and dims the scene just slightly. and i checked it against different types of material - the darker materials smd the lighter things. and they all seemed to respond exactly the s__mmeway. i can't see any - i can't see any effects of polarizing from the surface reflection at all."
okay. how you reading?
"hey, gene and ron, this is the csm capcom. thought you might be interested. your buddie up on - above you there is chugging on and about ready to bed down himself, right now. and he did take a good look at the landing site through binoculars tonight and took a good look at shorty crater there, and noticed quite a lot of varia- tions in color. that may be the same color changes you saw in that orange soil and that, but we're trying to match it all up. and farouk and ron are working it out. we're trying to match it all up and see if we can get a comparison there. lmi°-lm excellent. tell him we'll see him tomorrow."
"and, houston, i noticed through the aot and l'a_c 509 through the overhead docking window that we are venting again."
it's pretty - it's pretty loose now; it's in my pocket.
ail right. i've got page 9-4. go ahead.
yes.
276 plus 2.... (laughter) different attitudes.
"okay, karl, i'll read them to you. p52 stars were 01 and 36. the torquing angles were minus three balls 28, minus three balls 58, plus three balls 12. and they were torqued out at 119:05 on the minute. nfide day 6"
"okay, all set?"
that's affirm.
"okay, fine. we'll cycle that whole thing twice more."
"yes_ you're right, you're right, and i'm wrong."
u-1.
have to do it ...
i've been doing a good job.
... stanley holloway's crazy flight plan updates that we've just forgotten that we were ever late.
"yes, if we don't - -"
"okay. two things: first of all, we noticed a ,.o ns oo _h _n _ _l darn _+ z_t _ you started ta!king_ it got noisy again, fred; try it again."
"okay. starting the pan in the right position, tony."
roger. it looks like you're about a h_lf hour slow on it. we're working on consumables. over.
okay. let's zoom all the way.
"you've got it to 3 milliradians. you've got it to 2 milliradians. you've got it to 2 milliradians. now you've got it, ken. you killed it."
"gordy, this is jack. you guys did a good job fixing that mas - master alarm problem. what did you do?"
"that's affirmative, gordo; none of the lights flashed at all."
a-2 is as you have listed.
"set the det at 51,"
"that's negative, fred."
"i got to ask dick something and see if he'll do something for me. hey, dick. call me back when you got - have about 2 or 3 minutes."
"man, we are climbing out."
"yes, sir. 0b 11 59 58 lmp at 10 feet per second, we ***"
"okay; mapping camera to standby. laser altimeter, off. image motion, off. barber pole; gray."
"roger. we're ready to go, john."
okay. couldn't be any more noise than we're getting now.
okay. ascent helium 2; okay.
here.
roger; understand.
okay. i've got p66.
and you might want to take the ... tools in a second.
"ail right, now you're in good shape."
"look at me, jack; i show gain."
we think that's correct.
"he's been within a couple of counts of me, pete, during the whole flight."

it looks lighter to me. t
"roger, jack."
"that's a pretty good day's workout, you know. you know, i don't think we need an exercise period. we get back in there. i don't think we have to apologize to anybody. i'm sorry we didn't get out to station 1. one of the main reasons is, i think, we could have got our navigation bearings a little bit better."
stand by for mode iv capability.
okay. and that would be the coast of antarctica that sort of faces new zealand and australia. is that correct?
i should have warned you.

okay. we'll be watching our antenna. we're still on high gain.
okay.
"roger, fred. i would like to confi_j! that you are getting drinking water out of, povable water out of the command module and, if you can make any estimates of how much you use as time goes on, and how much you have used, we would appre- ciate it for our consumables analysis."

it's no trouble.

"okay. i've got verb 05, noun 01, enter. going to 17 06 enter."
"okay, gene."
"yes, sir. that's the map. each fold is lettered in the lower - or upper right-hand corner if you work your way from east to west and the charts are labeled d, e, and f and the solo stuff will all be the d and e, and they change with the plane change 1. that's the time they change the two maps."

that's good.
"oh, et cetera. yes."
okay.
"okay, joe; i'll buy that."

"yes. well, i made a mistake too. i thought eratosthenes was copernicus. but anyhow we got - we got a series on eratosthenes and also a series on copernicus. so we're in good shape."

yes. i'll hold still.

"yeah. i think space flight's kind of complicated. you got a lot of sophisticated equipment here that you're trying to get all working at one time. i think that's what we built a redundancy in for, and it seems to be paying off quite well. tape159/5"
do you have our altitude now? about 4000 miles maybe?
what is it that rattles?
b - - !
"but then again, you can focus the nikon."
okay. that looks good. okay?
roger.
okay.
"yes, sir. we got a double core tube and all put together correctly."
yeah. 04 04 31 16 _ okay. i just wondered. he looks like to me he's moving on out there some.
"and, joe, jack says ali the injector temperatures, he just checked them again, and they're all over 3.9--"
"how was the view on the way down, gene? (laughter)"
"why don't you turn it on so we'll get a check here, and then it'll be coming off in a second. think you got it with a toe or something?"
"... on that, jim?"
"11, houston. stand by just a moment here tmtil we get out of the no position on the artenna."

where's the attitude i'm supposed to go to?
"okay. unanimous opinion is that you're right, and we'll scratch all of this bennett comet stuff on the way out, with the hope that conditions will be more favorable after tei. over."
"houston, 13."
"it's a switch problem. yes, the light's still off. i bet it was a - when we did that sep, bet we got a little solder ball in that switch or something. 00 09 35 b1 c2_p bet we did, too. 00 09 35 _7 cdr roger. bravo is up and on; the light is off. now bravo is off and the light r_mains on [sic]."

"well, yes, as a matter of fact, he is. he's trying to get one of the compartments open."
it's a regular obstacle course over there.
"okay, ron. we're ready for lunar sounder, operate to operate. and if you'll give me a mark, i'll time it out for you."
what happened?
"okay. you want to ""load verb 48 (10101) and (xllll)."" after the circ burn and ahead of the verb 49 maneuver."
rogerl; copy.
"and, gene,before you go away, we'd like the rest of the rover readouts, like batteries. and how about a sep temp readout before one of you guys leave there?"
"okay. that bag's on there; now, let's see what else. ( dnf1dential"" 6 c5 11 51 26 cdr i need to get the tools tool, tool (singing). and before you put the tool in, we got to cut a tv cable. 05 11 51 32 _ ail right."

yes.
"well, we thought we'd give you about 8 hours to think about it."
"okay, these are readings off the systems test meter. 5-a is 4. - or 5-c is 4.2; 5-d is 3.9; 6-a is 4.1; b is 4.2; c is greater than 5; and d is 4.5."
"okay. i tried to get hank to send this up, but he wouldn't touch it either. i guess we'd like john on the biomed today and charlie on it tonight. and just a reminder, for today we'd like items 5 and 6 in the crew status recorded."
"okay, next one's - 1 second."
"okay, why don't we -"
okay. hold off on that. we'll - we'll get a procedure.
that's affirm.

"okay, and - hey, we just - we'll record that, al_d figure that you'll stow the probe and drogue over in the - where the cdr stands. we have a - a change to this - equipment transfer list that i just read up to jim. why don't you make a note of this one item? forget about the lm - -"
"okay, babe. fred, the surface, here *** talk about that, is - is textured. it - it is, of course, a very fine grain dusty regolith, much the same as we have in the vicinity of the _. but there seem to be small nebbles - more small pebbles here on the surface than we had back around the lm area. an_ the population of larger rocks, perhaps small bsulder-size, is more prevalent here. okay, this is probably pretty good. 05 11 54 30 dip yes, this is a good place for a and y'all might also ca_ent, fredo, that the - they have an appearance, here, quite often like raindrops - a very few rain- drops have splattered the surface, it gives you that appearance. obviously, they haven't; but it's that sorv of texture, in alaces."
(laughter) roger. glad it's not snowing on us with that stuff.
that'll be the same pad for both cameras.
"yeah, and they - they trend sort of upslope to the northwest, or to the - -"
okay.
"okay, on the back of the sun wheel - the aos/los sun wheel - we've entered an ink note to account for the fact that we change refs_at in the middle of his work there. we made an error on it. we've got to change the note now, and sometime when he's got that w_eel out, i can read him up the correction."
neat.
i think that's exactly what it all looks like.
"that's affirmative. we're ahead of you. no, dadgummit."
yes.
"and, along with that, deadband, max. 05 09 02 i1 lmp okay. three to mode control, comma, deadband to max."
"okay. let me see if i can get - get a map here that i can give you some reference on. the kind of flow that i'm t-lking about back there is - is sort of like the kind of flow from - that your - that you _-_ see in the mare materials. it's - it's not a big thing ... that you can trace back like you can some of these other things we've seen. ft's just sort of appears as a flow front. it's not sure where it comes from, and you can see it run down in the craters and around them. and, from that - i made a little more objective analysis of this stuff that you see on this back - this last pass when we came across on what we call the - the far side highlands. and it's my general impression that these - these flows - maybe that - maybe i'm using the wrong term - they look like flows. they have all the characteristics of a flow front, and yet there's places where they go along, and you'll see it with the scarp going down to the east, and then all of a sudden it'll get a little confused and then the scarp will be showing up going to the west. and then you'll see places where - there's one place in mandel'shtam - i think we have a picture of it - where this - this scarp, that looks like a flow front, curves in an arc to the right, and it's got material that comes from behind it. then all of a sudden it sort of %urns back in underneath itself and then just_'_. disappears. and there's - there's no flow front _ where it disappears underneath. it's - it's just a - it's a very strange thing. we""ve seen that in several other places. some were appearances in the photograph that farouk and i were looking at of baldenburger [sic]. now, that's on a much larger scale of course. but it's the same kind of problem, where you see a unit which is obviously overlaying another. and yet it's overlaying itself by one that the original unit happens to overlay. it's like a - a chain where each - each _ring overlaps the other one in a closed circle. and itis very confusing from that point. and let me look at my map here and see if i can give you some - some better handles. i think i took some pictures back there to mark it."
"oh, rats! i dropped the -"
i'll talk to you later. i think you're - we're losing you for a little bit here.
"i've been trying to spot tropical storm teresa, which is - a couple of days ago was in the philippines. but i can't - i don't think i quite have that visible to me right now."

okay. we'll proceed with the ptc and proceed with the powerdown. i guess if we have to we can reestablish ptc at a later date. okay. okay.
next step: connect waste management system to piss primary vent. 05 20 49 02 _mp-lm okay. i'll hook the waste management system to the primary vent. stand by on that one.

"no_ not yet. you don't change it until you get on the other side of yerkes, up there. your path goes directly between yerkes and ... - -"
"hey, charlie, there's dot."
"okay. those sound like supergood observations, eon."

"well, if i could get ron off his - work with the optics, we'd look at the earth some more. but that will come. right now i'm seeing all sorts of little ice crystals of various composition, (laughter) that are moving around, and every one of them bounces off the lm that i can see. no, none of them stick. i noticed that some of them will go into a corner with a fairly high velocity and either be turned around by a double bounce, or just get lodged in the corner and have very low velocity when they come out."
it sure was and i missed it. i'm sorry.
all you had to do was close them anyhow and leave that crossfeed open.
"okay, i read you loud and clear."
"yes, they're there. yes, sir."
wait a minute until i get my hands ###.
"okay, joe. go ahead with your questions, and in- tegrity is certainly what we need around here, right?"
okay.

there it is.

i'll tell you one thing - we're sure up in the air.
"still can't quite figure out what that circula- tion around new zealand means. it looks like it's merging with some more weather to the south- east. i suspect it's stormy there, but i still - it's not a terribly well-developed storm, although it seems to be broadening in its extent. australia is completely free of any significant weather and almost completely free - free of clouds. the - there appears to be a front - although right now it does not look too intense - approaching from the southwest. and it looks like it's about 5 degrees of longitude south of the southwestern tip of australia. the typhoon cirrus - or therese, i guess it is - appears to be just about the same pesition it was yesterday. and that is north of borneo and between vietnam _d the philippines."
"okay. we just appeared to get a solid lock for the last - oh, about a minute. the ... needle's been wandering up and down, and the pitch and yaw needles have been wandering around, but it ap- pears to have reacquired by itself solidly now. we're just finishing up our fuel cell purge. hy- drogen on number 3 is the last to go off. it'll be coming off in just a second."

just really shoots gas.
"well, use your own judgment. if - if you're in the shade, you won't need it. but if you're in the sun, you ought to have it down."
"roger, gene."
"that's 8-16. just before you open the ascent feeds, we want you to close syst_ a _,_in sov. 07 05 41 50 cdr-_d okay, close system a shutoff valve, just before opening the ascen_ feeds."
"okay. on ""eps activation,"" perform step l, and perform step 2, line 6 only; is that correct?"
"valve? i can't see the gage, but i know we're coming down."
"well, i might get one more exercise period in tonight before i go to bed."
"hey, do you need them all changed, hank, or can you send me to one so i don't have to waste time with all that stuff? you got to break out each one of those little things by itself and keep track of it. it - it takes a good 20 minutes if you change out the whole sensors."
"look at the - see we got zero rates. look at the - look what she pitch rate is, 5 degrees down."
"okay. big connector, you know."
"well, why don't you give us the big picture now, before we get too deep in the comm checks and all."
"okay. 03 11 55 17 _ say, gordy, 17."
"8:12, 13; 8:14; 8:15, 16; 8:18. there go the drogues."
"okay, 16; this is houston. if you go to po0 mhd accept, we'll up-link you. okay, just accept."
that - burn's going well.
"yes they really stand out in low sun. one of the things - i'm looking at one right here that's next to lassell c_ i'm going to start my strip and talk a little while i'm doing it. and that's at a - one that's just to the north of lassell c in that highlands clump that's next to it there. _ and - it looks like in the low sun, on the outside of it, you see all kinds of craters. you know, the typical low sun angle pictures of crater pat- terns. oh, down in the floor of this thing it's just as smooth as a whistle. like someone had drug a - something heavy through there and just made a deep impression."
remember when you go in that my aca - -
okay. do i dare use my ink pen this time?
okay.
are they? 04 17 43 45 _p yes.
okay o
go ahead. tape4/5
where? straight ahead?
"okay, 2 plus 40, exactly. thank you."
likes to spin when you turn going down hill.
"i - we talked to them about that, but they - -"
"it's just this - boy, you know, look at those rates. imag - imagine what that would look like if you're - really had the thing swinging."
"okay. i'm coming. here we go - 3.6, .7, .8."
yes. it would have been an even better one about 10 minutes later.
okay. maybe you can ma_k that on your map where you see these concentrations.
mine's 4.8.
"okay. there's a data point. that's a 166 miles in the sunset. 07 07 46 08 i_p yeah. okay. verb 80 - p20 auto maneuver, verb 80."
okay. we're over 2. there you go. we're coming · in ... wow !
"gentlemen, everything looks perfect down here, and - all we can say is, ""have a good burn."""
"how about menelaus. 06 ll 49 b1 cmp menelaus. that's it. yes. from tacquet up to menelaus now, the - that's got to be a buildup of material and it's more on the tan side than it is on the - more of a dark tan than it is to the tannish-gray. so it's a different type of material than - than on the annulus down below the crater, tacquet."
what?
okay. copy that.
"are you getting a rake, charlie?"
"we've just got through with the playback, and we've got excellent burn data down here. and, if you'll give us accept, we'll send up a refsmmat."
"388, tony."
okay. i got all those.
"right, sounds good."
198.
"where else would we be? 09 21 56 26 iaip - - the 12 kilometers that we visited, that is - that is a hypothesis that could - could work. that might not hold true for anywhere else but right there."
"okay, houston. you got 93? okay. he got that, jack. okay. we'll leave the antenna in. okay. on mine, i'm going to open my audio, and connect to the comm, jack."
"_n_d, vance, thought we'd get a picture of jack just so that all the girls know that he's still here."
"man, that ems would have gotten hc_e."
"roger, houston; understand."
"and, dave, we see you're carrying the ignition - the ignition key there for the rover."
"yeah, i could see you visually right after lift- off, when we were supposed to be like 150 miles away. o7 08 ll 58 _ ..."
"i'm a smooth talker, aren't i?"
- - off/reset.
right - right - we're going to pass over it in just a second. you can probably see it out dick's window. two of them: three of them.
okay. and you're loud and clear.
why don't you get the core tubes out?
i can see it going past you.
pressures all look normal?
"roger, al. try and point it off where you don't get any reflectance into it_ and we'll be thinking about it here on the ground."
i'm about 5 degrees from it. you can go ahead smd ...
okay. c - dispi_y/engine override logic is closed.
"okay, these are readings off the systems test meter: 5-a is 4. - or 5-c is 4.2, 5-d is 3.9; 6-a is 4.1, b is 4.2, c is greater than 5, and d is 4.5."
okay.
"okay. that h20 valve open? okay, that's a good idea boy. purge valves - -"
"roger, dave and jim. ed's coming on the line down here. just wanted to say i enjoyed it."
"okay; here we go with the crew status report. first, i'd like to say that we stuffed and gorged ourselves; really, and still couldn't eat every- thing. i tell you, one of those meals would fill the whole roman arn_ on maneuvers for 2 days. but john, he ate the - yesterday's meal, day 5 meal c, and day 6 meal a. and on day 5 meal c, john ate everything, plus the eva beverage. and the day 6 meal a, which was breakfast yesterday, john ate everything except the ham steak - scratch the ham steak. he got 7 hours and 15 minutes sleep last night, and he took no medication. over. 05 19 25 ir cc okay; we got that, charlie."
and it's not always clear which way to turn to - to turn them over.
"okay, houston. we're going to push the shorting switch."
go ahead.
okay. will do.
"okay, dave - jim, take a breather, if you would, please; and, dave, you're getting a - a - lcru blankets at 35 percent open at the same time, i'm sure."
"okay, al; sounds like fun. enjoy the back side, and see you in a few minutes. and if there's any- thing you need from us down here, just give a call."
"that doesn't look like a secondary, john."
okay.
that's amazing. something's screwed up here.
i'm reading 10 percent.
"okay, ed. thank you."
we got it. _n fident j_ day 6
"okay, houston. you should have us now."
"one minute, houston, and we're standing by. we're go for pdi."
"in short, jim, we don't expect any problem, but we'll explain further later on."
"okay, thank you, karl. we will. huh? see around what ... problem? oh."
yes.
that's right; with the exception of verb 48.
it looks like a different type of rock.
a_d we have the usual couple of parker valves.
"do you want to watch the cable as we go out, ed?"
fifteen even.
"that's affirmative, ll."
okay.
- - plus the minute. so with a foot per second there - which might be significant -
"apollo 15, houston; standing by."
...
how far to the - either side of the groundtrack do you think you can adequately see?
"say aga3n, buzz? over. 01 08 53 58 lm_ roger. w]aat's the latest on luna 157"
"we'll buy that. well, the z-axis here looks pretty good, anyway. you're clear to torque. (laughterl okay. we'll torque at 2i - i missea 30 - let's go to 21:45. 08 23 4i 40 cc okay."
"yes, i turned the dump off."
"roger; understand. due to the changes yes_erdam that were not updated today, on pages 16 and 17 of the timeline book s you came out without ac power. 08 04 55 10 i2_p that's apparently what happened, and i think that the atca/pgns needs ac to fire the jets - hut i'm n3t really - to get the control voltage, but i'm not really positive. 08 o_ 55 21 cc they're saying here, charlie, that ac is not re- quired to fire the jets. 08 04 55 28 i2_p okay. then that didn't - hm_. okay. well, i don't know what happened, then. 08 o_ 55 34 cc roger. don't worry about it, chariie. we're not. 08 04 55 48 i2,_ okay; fine. it's just - disappointing. except for that one switch, i left everything just like you wanted it."
okay.
"okay; that's - experiment checklist, page x/2-3, gegenschein pass 2. now you gave me some step numbers; does that mean i don't do the whole pass?"
"i think this is the crater that's at - that's at b. i think this boulder field, we can see it here, if you look. $,onfidentia"
maybe they just happened to fall open.
off.
"you're the first man to fly over this mountain range, dave. i guess pretty soon you're going to be over the - over the landing site, aren't you? 03 07 27 h8 cdr roger. but i'm afraid it'll be dark today."
"al, a bulletin from hadley rille says that -"
"yeah. i do, too. okay, now this one is plus 160 and ... is straight forward to ... 6. okay, that looks okay. well, john, don't get to ..."
"you got it? you said you did not have a tone, is that correct?"
"guten morgen, mein herr. ist gut."
"okay. i want a yaw left, 60."
"go ahead, houston."
"okay, go ahead, vance."
"roger, jim."
roger. go ahead with your questions.
"dave, it's - i guess that the 2-minute mark out to the side of your checklist there is meaningless in this case, because the test is in no way time critical. we want you to take your own time and work to get the light on, but if it does come on at about i minute before the burn, we'll want you to go into program 47."
"okay, safe the pyros. logic 2 is off, logic 1 is off."
"houston, 17."
great. we got all our landing gear?
"(cough) okay, that soil sample's in bag 369, houston."
"16, houston. the attitude in the flight plan for the verb 49 is okay. you can go ahead with it."
mtvc - neutral. return to zero.
"that's swp, all right. swp's a bigger hole _han i thought it was."
okay; you sure see the change. *#* up on the high place here. 06 00 35 32 i_p-eva above the bench. let's try it right there.
"okay. let me get my bum out of your way. okay, john's in, tony."
"roger; copy. 03 07 20 35 _ probably getting carried away with all of vhis, bu_ we've - we've got all kinds of things to see back there. it would really be nice to fly that kind of an orbit down low."
"okay, thank you now."
"roger. on the midcourse at 105, and i'm on page 24."
"mark it. let's see, where am i?"
"17, houston. i have the morning news here, when- ever you'd like to hear it - if you would."
that's affirm.
"hey, john, ... halfway."
"yes, bob, i gave you one. we've been rolling for about 30 seconds."
okay. your computer; the up-link's in.
",dh, i'm trying to set something up here. 06 05 55 59 lmp-im okay."
"okay, jack. going to hold up 1. ail the hordes of people that devised this procedure are going to be coming into the room in a minute, and they'd like to hold up until everybody can listen in."
- - 42 000. 10 0_ 30 06 _ okay.
go ahead. go ahead.
"the readback is correct and the next - next change is at 219:07; and once again delete the ""pcm cable"" line. and at 219:17 add, ""laser altimeter, off; close map camera and laser experiment covers."" and delete map camera extension. and the last addi- tion, that is to say the last change, is at 220 plus 05, delete the ""pcm cable"" line. over."
"just wanted to get comm there again. _tehad some switchover there. you might be interested; we've got an ats map in here from this morning. just - you're just about on - we can see the flow patterns in the antarctic just about at - 120 degrees west, which is a little closer to south america than what you're calling, i guess. but we do - we do see that activity down there."
six minutes until we get that damn descent time. did you get that data on ...? 07 04 16 08 cml° ... sounds like i'm ... up.
"roger. we lost the tm and the voice for about 5 minutes here. we attempted a handover and fouled it up in some manner, but we got you back now. thank you much."
rats. can't see that ... velcro ...
"i have no idea, charlie. 07 22 17 45 imp ..."
"okay, ron. the rule says, ""if no start on a, try b."" 07 1i 46 47 cmp okay. that's what i thought. (h_nm[ng) plenty of battery juice here. let's go to a, on - and 3, is on and coming up - okay, fuel ce!_ 3, pressure is all right in 2-a; and 2-b is okay. and helium valves are in auto, we're in decrease; and the oxidizer flow valve pug mode is primary. primary, decreased, and normal. okay. that's a lot of work. i'd like to get strapped in a little bit here. 07 i1 48 04 cmp okay. bus tie - i forgot the crazy tape recorder. c0_&nd reset - here we go. okay. helium valves, i did that. serv0 power 1. okay - number 2, back to ac."
okay; 65.
yes.
"joe, you can see on the tv. that's what we got. now the vise - the - the wrench - my hand wrench works okay. the one on the back of the handtool _ - carrier doesn't seem to want to work for some reason. it may just be because of the threads on the - the stems. we just - i just can't get them broken apart. and that's the main problem. the - the wrenches don't work."
are you serious?
"can you - o0 02 06 ok cdr not with the seat down, you can't, charlie."
yes.
"stand by. we estimate you've got about a kilometer and a half to go - a little over a kilometer, anyway. stand by, we'll check on the time. you're doing great."
"stand by on that, pete."
no. 04 20 14 01 i2_p right here?
"we're reviewing that fi]m that you took - that tir that y:u took last night. -r,d _here are a lot of sparklies out the windo-,; there. _,;erethose all just loose particles floating around?"
(}kay.
"- - we'd like for you to bring up the high gain, and you' re there."
"if you have something there to go in the hot water, dave, i'll stick them on for you."
"okay, and i don't know what i can do about it, seno."
"falcon, houston. verify slew. we're about to hand over."
okay.
both cartridges are out.
"okay, challenger. we saw it, and it looks good. rcs looks good."
"11, houston. on the rcs, what we are saying is that if we lose control about one axis prior to low gate, we would recommend an abort. this would require a - a loss of - of two distinct jets which is not very probable, but that is what we are recommending. after low gate we would continue on. we would recommend that we continue on to attempt a landing. over. (goss net 1) tape 38/7"
just take some of it off.
i don't know where the bench crater was. i really don't.
"let's try about 45 there; we'd like to get %he flag in at the right extremity and the plus-y, if we can, at the left extremity. hold that."
pitch is good ....
"okay, let's see. at ... 52:36, we're going to pick them up over canaries."
wait a minute; i'm deploying it.
"okay, joe; i'm ready to copy."
"okay. okay, before you go back - i got to go down after a picture here. and i want to get a pan of this thing. we can get a stereo pan - as you start your radial sample."
and we want to get that prior to that cm/lm pres- sure equalization decal.
okay; that'll be fine.
okay; copy.
"i'm not so sure, dave. looks like you're handling that pretty well."
"okay, do you guys still have a closure rate? do i still have a closure rate? okay. looks like the old ems is just sort of sitting here looking at itself."
"orion, this is houston. if it's convenient, charlie, will you put the bi0r._ed into the right pos;ition?"
and the zodiacal light i'll keep on - keep on xx.
"okay, why don't we get that reference soil and look around for a little bit smaller boulder to turn over."
what's that?
"okay. okay. okay. i've backed up here so i get all of that in there. there, that 's good. good. got the mountain, got the km. great. 06 04 55 58 i_[p-eva got it?"
i found it. 09 08 09 23 ci_° ...
"okay, and from your - listening to your descent, it sounded like you picked it up about 90 feet."
look in the rear detent now. go to -
"okay .... operate it, though."
"it's done. going for 18 now. i'll check the rcs and ever_%hing for you. looks beautiful, pete. you know, it's very interesting; every time the thrusters fire, those reg's bounce."

"okay. that - did you get a - hold it, and i'll get a shot."
"hey, houston, how do you read on the high gain?"
"here's the thing; you put our map around the way we're going - see, and out your side you ought to see a huge old one."
"okay. potable tank inlet is now closed, and say again the other one."
- - i think so; you have to pull out this. the top side ... in the inside.
okay.
"okay. now i heard earlier that you could see double spot with binocs. does that sound right, ken?"
okay. i']] be standing by to copy it.
"no, 72:55, 55. 02 20 b6 45 cmp roger. 72:55. 02 20 b7 56 cc okay, jack. we got you at 130 right now."
"okay. caught the cable again. hold it. al, hold it."
no way; you got a longer history than i do.
"wait; hold the - hold the phone - hold the phone a minute, pete."
"yes, i have them."
"yes, that's affirm. and he was retransmitting on vhf; evidently, you weren't reading our vhf."
okay ....
"roger, geno. stand by. okay; we're ready."
neutral. trim zero.
"houston, endeavour. we're ready to chitty-chat, if you like."
roger.
wasn't that a sim they ever gave us? '00 00 06 46 cmp jesus!
it isn't gonna be any good unless we put it in the sack? 06 03 27 05 lm3-eva i don't think they'll ever recognize it again.
i better -
"yes, open. yes, i'm all set."
"roger. we're go. o0 02 50 % cc apollo ll, this is houston. we show c_-off and we copy the numbers in noun 62. 00 02 50 _4 cc apollo ll, houston. do you read? o0 02 51 8 cc apollo ll, this is houston. do you re_d? over."
"okay, you got it?"

go ahead.
ail closed except the aea.
"we're at 106, 3. - -"
"()kay, i'll get that answered while i read you the next."
"go ahead, bob."
go ahead. c_ ... the last ... take a ... with the lunar sounder.
"okay. on the same page, 268:30, gamma ray gainstep, five steps."
...
okay.
and you're not going to be at that attitude by 36. it'll be more like 38.
a little more?
...
"okay, one purge valve, coming up."
"no, sir; i did not. i didn't even get my head out of the cockpit."
are you still picking up some mares here?
guess i can change the dap here and get that out of the way.
"okay. #4* more time. your helmet is locked, purge valve, locked. ### #** that's locked; *** locked. ### let me see - ### see. sure and that's locked."
"so anything that's a single letter is yours. so what i'm really looking for is ss, tt, and uu."
"put this cover on it, so we can make sure it's been used."
"this one right here, you mean?"
thank you.
hear you loud and clear.

"okay, back to manual on the temp in."
"okay, al. how do you read on a?"
"five-by, eagle. we're standing by for your burn report. over. 04 06 17 36 iaip roger. the burn was on time. the residuals be- (eagle) fore nulling: minus 0.1, minus 0.4, minus 0.1, x and z nulled to zero ... hulling ..."

okay.
okay.
okay.
huh?
"watch it. ho - ho - ho hold it, h,-ld it, hold it!"
"roger, ron."
"the other way, charlie. 05 22 22 l0 lmp-_ okay, if you'll give me one side to hold for you - -"
"vance, to my calculations, we have taken about 10 earth window photography pictures. i see nothing coming up here except to elose the waste stowage vent here in a little while. i was thinking about getting squared away to bed down for the evening pretty soon."
yes.
"hello, orion; this is houston."
okay. how did our ... configurations appear to be working down there?
going to be at 109:46:30. going to be right straight out there or what? i wonder.
"you know me; i hate to run. shit, that's all i was - did was - -"
sure will.
and we're gradually increasing. a very gentle slope.
"okay. our noun 49 is reading: register 1, plus 08793; register 2, all balls."
"ytca, both to jets."
"apollo 15, houston. over."
"okay. let me put the scoop back. okay, going to 1 right now."
i wouldn't do that. it's not worth doing.
"(laughter) yes. got to get the dust cover on the ..., okay?"
"okay. if you guys have a moment or two, we have some flight plan updates concerning entry - entry cue cards and entry checklist. over."
okay.
"roger. stand by a second. (goss net 1) tape 20/3 _)1 06 '_! _ cc _oldstone m&o, houston cap c()_. over."
"yes, i'm back up to about 7 to 10 now, bob. that's the slowdown - is becau_e that's about all it wiil take. lmp-_;a bob, i have the impression that there is a dipping zone of blue-gray outcrops or block concentrations up there on the massif that trends from the high point just beneath the earth - cross-slope - and probably is - at least the apparent depth is - oh, i don't know, 10 or 15 degrees to the east. it looks like those outcrops may match up along that trend."
"they're just - i - next time we use the ir, let's just remember to open the cover."
"john, see if i got the red dot on my ca_._era. it stopped running."
she's steady as a rock. pc's up to 100.
"what else we got? l0 05 35 28 cml° it's time for the uv stuff, huh? let me get out of your way. you couldn't find any more pills, right?"
"look at that. okay, what's next?"
"america, houston. when you get her stopped there, we'd like you to hold the attitude until we get the dse dump before doing the verb 49. ll 21 26 o0 cmi_ okay, gordo. we're there now."
"actually, i don't see any fillet, per se. i think it just hit and made a - stick it in the dirt. *** end it up in the dirt, charlie. *** tell which way is up. how about right there?"
"apollo 15, apollo 15, let's keep it at .375."
okay.
check the nitrogen; looks good. not a thing.
"i don't think i even dismounted it to see those ... i know i didn't take 60 pictures of herschel, pete. did you have anything on your camera before?"
"mark. thirty-five, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42. 08 08 24 18 cor shutdown."
give him a - -
okay. we understand. and do you see a blocky rim crater within walking distance?
"okay, i'm stabilized at about 3.8. and the 02 flag is clear."
"well, i think that'll stay down, but it's not very good - - ' cdr-eva okay. i've got one more loose sample i'm going to throw in the big bag back there ...."
well. no. i - i don't think i - i'm not aware of anything i did id that injector that was wrong. i think the capture just broke.
"you want to get those readings now, al, or after supper?"
"roger. america, houston. we read you loud and clear."
"oh, what's the ...? how much time we got before ...?"
0kay; stand by 1.
"the other can is down. a jett bag. i mean, the bplss bag."
"apollo 13, houston. we'd like to charge battery a now."
"and it's in a-7, right?"
"okay, tony, the pan is complete. the struts - the lm just looks super. it - it's in perfect posi - perfect shape. no problem. the soil around here is very fine grain. dusty, much like all the regolith that we've seen sa_ples of from the other sites. the rocks are scattered. perhaps 20 or 30 percent of the surface is covered by boulders up to 25 centimeters. small craters pock mark up the whole place; meter to 2-meter size, covering perhaps 70 percent of the surface."
roger.
"ron, if you'll give us accept_ we'll give you your tei refs}_t."
"okay, charlie, and you're okay."
"okay. this bag is pretty full. we got two full rock box - bags and a - and one that's partially full, john."
"okay. our pictures show a crevice below 101, and also while you're right there, i - i don't think it's even - there's a crevice above the door for the optics stowage area that you might check up in there. it might have lodged. and, also, while you're right there, ron, our picture, of course, shows your hoses stowed, and they kind of come out right there to the right of panel 120, the optics stowage area. and so you've got some area behind those panels - behind those hoses and that - where it might have lodged, but i believe you had to move those in order to do your eva yesterday, anyway."
"yes. it looks like a big piece of glass. it's got some bubbles in it. oh, look at that. isn't that pretty? 06 01 51 15 i]_i°-eva that's a glass-coated breccia."

roger. we're ready to go to the next step.
okay.
thank you.
okay. repress is closed.
"a couple of requests - for you here. we would, first of all, like the mass spectrometer discriminator switch to low. over."
"well, the big thing is, let's get those - let's get the boulder and then get in that east-west split. bob, i got an undo_ented sample from the middle of the boulder track."
3kay.
"roger. step 8. we delete ""enable all jets,"" and what we record is the magazine percent. and that's the end of the correction."
"take both of them. 06 02 58 36 _ i'll take it ..., if you like."
"okay, fine. if you'd like, i'll continue on with that."
"yeah, might as well. we've got to go by that big rock. is that where we're going, to that big rock?"

(laughter)
okay. i was just making a comm check here. i'm on high voltage taps.

shall we save ourselves some ascent weight?
"okay, real fine. you might tell him when we get to that point, we have some - some stars with corresponding shaft and trunnion angles to pass to him as backups in case the computer doesn't happen to point him straight at one. and it's the summer triangle."

we can even see the barber pole of the talkbacks.

okay; 3 minutes and we're go.
and that will delete it over at 163:05. you'll just delete it from that point. cml° okay.
"okay, that's good - plenty good enough for us. as you know, we think that you've got two good batteries, but possibly a failed meter there. and the rover power consumption looks like it's right on the money, and we've got a lot of gas for the next eva. the amp-hour meter data which we have does have a couple of erratic points in it. we're wondering if you noticed any meter-movement anomalies."
yes. roger. i'd like to get that other one later on before ... leave this attitude.
which one? l_-eva make sure that's locked on there.
go ahead.

"roger. stand by a second, please. 00 03 45 25 cm} roger. standing by. the reppgss packige valve is now in the off position. wtiat's the cabin pressure now, buzz? cabin pressure is now 4.5."
i covered the recovery area. not the rest of the pacific. did you want an overall briefing?
"that's a good readhack, fred."
"yes, turn - -"
that was right on the profile. good ...
understand.
"okay, jack. you're on?"
just passed 2 minutes.
"what - what - what - what g&n? number 6, is that the one that - -"
mark; gene.
"stand by, pete. we're looking at lines right now; we don't have our map up."
...
"okay, as a quick review here, doi is a single-bank burn on b, with nominal procedures, with the excep- tf_ tion of having the a pilot valve open."
"roger. 06 09 54 2b cmp you know, that's kind of funny now, looking back at sulpicius gallus and just to the north of that, -- -- 9-- ' -- there's a crater that's about - well, it's right at the end of those rilles that go north from sulpicius gallus. and you can really see the ejecta blanket. the ejecta blanket looks very dark, around it now in this sun. now you look out across the mare serenitatis now and you're getting toward the sunset, looking back into the sun, and the color is disappearing all except in that one spot. now that must be a - either a fresh ejecta - and you look the brightness of it or something - or either that or it's dark. it's sure a dark - it's a dark ejecta blanket around it. the blanket itself goes out maybe two or three crater diameters, and it looks like it has kind of a ray-type pattern to it. i'll mark that crater. i don't even know if it has got a name or not, but i'll mark it on my _-p."
that sounded good.
up tel to block.
go ahead.
coming up.
"oh, yeah. look - look, john."
"hello, geno. good morning."
okay. looks like we're damped. o0 03 3b 27 cdr okay; ready? o0 03 b3 29 cmp we're off at a little bit of an angle. o0 03 b3 30 i_p here. i can hold this a minute ....
...?
"i can see from up at the top of the rille down, there's - there's debris all the way. and, it looks like some outcrops directly at about ll o'clock to the sun line. it looks like a layer. about 5 percent of the - the rille wall, with a vertical face on it. and, within the vertical face, i can see other small lineations - horizontal about maybe l0 percent of that - that unit. and that unit outcrops along the rille. it's about l0 percent from the top, and it's somewhat irregular; but it looks to be a continuous layer. it may be porzions of - of flows, but they're generally at - at about the 10-percent level. i can see another one at about 12 o'clock to the sun line, which is some- what thinner, maybe 5 percent of the total depth of the rille. however, it has a more well-defined interior - internal layering of about l0 percent of - of its thickness. i can see maybe l0 very well-defined layers within that unit."
"roger, houston. we thought we'd get the tunnel cleared out because, with all that extra gear in the command module, it's sort of tough to find a place to stow everything. and the tv is - right now, sort of in the way. so we'll try and get to you as soon as we can."
go.
"apparently it has no affect. good choice, though."
we copy.
oops.
"that's affirmative. that would be perhaps the easiest and best place to do it, and you can get that one core tube down in the bottom of the trench."
"very good. very good. hello, folks."
you might check. i was loading noun 22. and you might just doublecheck and see what you saw down there and make sure i wasn't loading noun 20.
"rate scale, 5 degrees."
and you'll have to go toward them.
"well, there's been some big - big fresh ones. we'll - we'll look for one."
okay. i thought you were on there.
"okay, grab the scoop."
"okay, we just had lift-off at white sands."

"hey, jim."
"p, as in papa; 17 delta, d as in delta. 17 delta."
you're so right.
"okay, what do you want? what can i do for you, bob?"
"okay. when comm is lo'st, sce power off, pmp power off. 05 07 52 147 cc that's correct, jack, and that completes the entry checklist. let's look at the g&c book."

am i hitting the antenna?
"and another strange sight over here, i think it's andel, that's where i'm supposed to be ending the strip. but there's another crater here that looks like it's flooded, except this same flooded material seems to run up on the outside. you can see a definite patch of this stuff that's run down inside an old crater. and that material at least lays on top of it, but it lays on top of things that are outside and higher. it's a very strange operation. i guess we'll have to wait and let someone that knows what they're talking about look at the pictures."
"okay, ken, that's fine."
"no, i did it."
"roger, al."
okay. that's 5-b.
you dumping down to 157
(laughter ) it's funny.
that's right. close the black ones and open the white ones. 02 12 39 12 _ yes. i think we can manage that.
okay.
"roger. we'll reserve judgment on that, but keep describing, please. sounds great."
"roger, jim. we were hoping that in your ptc that you occasionally see the earth coming through the window; and, if that's true, then we'd like you to have to - just damp the rates with the earth in the forward window. and then we '11 give you the burn attitude via the forward window on the earth momentarily. over."
roger. we've got a good signal there. thank you _ch.
"has to be gienah, i hope. oh, that's noz so bad."
"only, i don't know how you get hot fuel."
0kay.
"okay. yes. that's airglow i can see, because i can see the stars underneath it."
"okay, jack. on your entry checklist, on pa? 2-5. down there on step 9, where it says 152 degrees pitch at .o5g, adjacent to that, so that recovery can see you better on the way down, we want you to turn your s-band_ power amplifier to high. over. 05 i5 23 25 cmp okay. turn s-band, power amp to high at .o5g time."
"okay, charge number 8."
roger. quite a bit of noise now. i understand you're still having a problem getting there with the ptc.
no.
"roger. we'd like to move that ""verb 49 maneuver to lunar surface photo attitude"" that you'll find at r -_ 225:30 in the flight plan. we'd like to move that up to 225:24. over."
"roger. if one of you fellows has the time, we might like to continue on with the mass spec boom retract test."
oh.
no - -
take it away. isn't this great? o0 00 44 23 _ isn't this marvelous? dnfide
"okay, the delta-p is coming down, bob."
it's coming off - it's coming off the - conden - the condensation is coming off the glycol lines.
"okay. photo solar array; got photo, footpad 3. those solar arrays are not blue anymore; they're black. 05 14 12 31 _p hey, how do you do that? let me try it from here. oops - what's the solar array setting?"

copy you. go for depress.
"now to the north of antarctica. let's see now. i ought to give you a better orientation than that. but, anyway, there is a large cyclone circulation pattern that has its southern extremity right on the edge of the ice shelf. and that - that is east by 20 or 30 degrees of longitude of the front that i just was discussing. by the way, that front intersects antarctica."

hung up - on something.

okay.
that's off.
okay. all closed accept. okay. i'm ready to copy.
"okay. you got your camera. my camera is in the floor pan. cap dispenser, scb to gate 1. let me get that, jack."
roger. we've been running in low bit rate.
do you know ...?
"accumulator cycle, we confirm."
okay.
"keeping you busy, huh_"
...
"okay, read to 3.8."
roger; very good.
"..., jim.... one whole week ..."
yeah.
we'd like omni alfa.

"ken, we'd like to see the turnoff of the sim bay that's on 3-6 before you turn our data off."
"roger. and no reports - no report from the chinch bugs there, mike."
dump it.
"130. we're right on, john. right back on profile."
okay. that shows i got a 59 by 9.
roger. they'll be at elbow corn - crater in just a couple of minutes.
roger. understand. do you care whether my trans- (columbia) ponder is on before tl?
okay. oh nol
did you check the rcs? okay. ecs look all right?
"that's affirmative. and down below at plus 3 sec- onds, you can cross out the delta-v thrust switch, normal, there since this is a single bank burn. and - al, we'd like to have high gain antenna, wide beam, for about 5 seconds and then, narrow."

"oh, that was a baddy."
"no, 2 down - -"
"that's right, jack, and what this - what we're planning to do in order to conserve power is we're going to run the suit compressor from a_ hour to this point at ]minus 40. and we'll be watching the pc02; if nhat thing's working, we'll turn it off at the earliest time that we have a good cabin, and then we'll just leave iv off. and in the event that the pco2 gage isn't working properly or something like that, well, we'll just go ahead and run it loc this time frame."
and it's _most directly east of menelaus.
"oh, we'll just press on to 50 degrees, and stop there. we thought you could pick it up on the way around."
*** ken.
i wonder if i ever turned - i wonder if i ever turned it on?
"that is aquarius. we're getting an awful lot of static on the uplink now, and we're not reading you at all."

roger. you don't - you can't tie them to any other action or event there then? is that right?

yes.
roger.
"roger, dave. we're standing by. o1 o1 28 42 imp okay. we all figure we had 8 hours. dave figures he got his in about three; alfred, two; and ... about five."

okay. copy that. no complaints.
okay.
"okay. and then about one-third of the way down - and there's a nice, big, very interesting outcrop over there, which looks like vertical jointing in a big block, with a horizontal layer on the top; the block must be, oh, 2 percent of the rille height and it must be about the - oh, twice that across, with the layer maybe one-quarter of the height of the block, and i got a 500 of that. i'll also take you a 500 vertical in the same area."

"okay, lo bit rate. and charlie's changing the lioh canister right now."
i may never get my equilibrium.
"okay, i got you that time, jack. lmp. i think your vox is cutting us out. when you talk to yourself, i think you cut us out."
"oh, my scoop. my scoop just came off. that's interesting. i'd better check the rake. vibrated loose, i guess."
"now, let's see where we are, i don't want to run into that big crater at the foot of the - -"
"sounds like you're really living it up, up there. chuck berry says he's delighted."
"the reason i ask, ken, is for this p52, i need to be close to the right attitude to pick up the stars. 03 22 22 35 cml° it's the same set of time-line procedures we've been using."

"okay. o0 00 29 lb cdr here's your lexan, jim."
roger.
"okay, america. we're ready for the high gain. pitch, 43; yaw of 262."
"okay, jack. now that's the - those are the time-line notes i had for you. i hate to tell you this, but i also have a couple of corrections to make to the entry checklist. they aren't cor- rections, they just are pieces of the entry checklist which will correspond to what i've written - already read to you. and i'm ready to to on that whenever you are. and vance tells me you can get into the descent water for drinking now."
"but - one of - one of the things, i was just sitting here looking at the equipment and some of the things that have caused more interest than others in what we were doing. and - one of the things that is at the heart of a lot of your time in this spacecraft is fixing something to eat. now, i'm - without discussing whether or not you need to eat this much, just the idea that if you try to eat part of it, it takes an awful long time to fix each of these things. and one of the big hangups is we all get clustered around the water gun. we've talked about gas coming out of the water gun, and this is not the drink port, but the food-preparation station. and the - if you - one of the ways we found we could induce gas bubbles into the waker was b2fderress- lng the plunger before it had had a chance to com- plete 'its stroke. if you let it complete its stroke, it seems to give you a nice, relatively gas-free shot of water. and it looks like the hot water gives you more for an ounce than the cold water does. but if you're very meticulous about waiting until you're sure that the plunger has made its full travel, and then count to l0 or something before you push it again, the cold water isn't quite as short as it looks like it is. and i don't really know how to explain why we have gas bubbles sometimes and why we don't. it's almost as though the gas separator may not affect the problem. we started out and the first couple of days we didn't have any gas. i guess about 2 days. then on the third day, we started getting gas in the hot water and we were getting like 50 percent gas. we tried the cigar gas separator, and that - that - after we got it flushed out the first time, seemed to work pretty well. and then it started getting gas, so we decided to try the prototype model. then when we put it on the feed station - why, as soon as we put it on, why, we made a squirt and nothing came out, and we decided to try it again. and by then, it was obvious that it was building up pressure inside, and the food station was putting out water, and it wasn't coming out the other end. and we never did get water to come out the - the outlet side of the new gas separator. and it looks like it has a crack in the top on the inlet side, and the gas - the water was bubbling out of that. it was coming out under pressure. when we took the thing off, why, you could tell that the cheek valve or some- thing, had never been opened. so we really don't know whether that thing has arq effective use or not. and it - it seems like the more water you use, the more gas you get. i don't - i'm not sure i completely understand that. you get more gas in the hot water than you do in the cold water. but the water i've been getting out today and yesterday has been almost gasfree. i can spin it up here, and i won't get - i get a zone of less than l0 percent gas. and that's l0 percent of a 7-ounce food - juice bag. the other day we were getting 50 percent. and i really can't psych out exactly all the causes for it. the cigar food - cigar dispenser there has some problems of its own. and every time you get through with it, it dribbles. and it will dribble for quite a while. but i found out if you put the little cap on it right away, then it quits dribbling. and it's only that initial f_ dribble, and the rest of it from there on is easy. i really don't expect anything to be done with these comments. i just want to - we're supposed to evaluate these things, hank. and rather than write them down - it's a lot easier to put here, and i'll get it off the tape after the flight."
yes.
okay. i think i will just put another little note out here.
... that one over there?
"i think so, joe."
roger. there is some speculation that you all are responsible for that 1-1/2-point rise right after opening.
"probably warmup afterwhile a bit. well, this thing kind of wants to - wants to yaw left all the time."

what is it?

okay. i copied the optics to zero and the optics zero to off when in cmc mode control.

"okay, jack, keep me honest on those rilles. ia_p-eva okay, you're okay now. let me get over on the rille. i don't see -"
i don't understand.

"mark; rrt. watch is started. i1 01 37 35 cmp clock's running. okay, i'm going to rate command."
6-c?
go ahead.
"casper, the computer's yours."
won or lost?
"okay', houston; there are the angles. it does look like that middle gimbal is - might be a little large, but it's - it was late last night when we had the last alignment, so that may be - that may be nominal."
okay. come back in here and - man take a dive.
roger.
oh.
"okay. i've gotj3·7. no, let me give a little more."
"no, not yet, dave."
"houston, endeavour; go ahead."
that's where ! am..
"endeavour, houston. in the blind, best omni, please."
i have three in rate command.
"yes, gordy, i think we'd like to take this oppor- tunity to each say a word or two."
"yes, sir."
okay. i think that will ride all right.
"verify forward dump valve, auto."
okay.
get set. keep ... it's better in here. slow now ...
"apollo 14, houston through aria 2. over."
i just want something i can clean the windows with. they're sticky. need a whole bunch of them. 02 21 49 i7 lmp ...?
where's he at?
we have an approximate total of about 36.1.
okay. that's low.
can you take up some tension and i'll _ull it in?
(laughter) okay.
go ahead_ dave.
"we have them, charlie."
"roger, jim, i had to change echo for you. i'm up to change foxtrot already, if you're ready to copy."
3i'5.
"no, i'm sorry. delta-v z was minus all zeros ·l - .1 on delta-v . z"
"that's correct. and now, on the first star of p23, we're going to change the star, so cross out - replace the noun 70 numbers with star 21. that would be three balls 21. and delete the noun 88 and the vector numbers there."
stand by.
and we - and poppy - and was just over about where - -
"okay, give me 208."
"ken, i know this is going to sound funny, but it looks like that mixing valve is working now. it didn't go up like we thought it would."
"jack, i think the answer to that is yes. per the checklist, by the way. that's the way we show it in our checklist here."
what in christ's name is this?
throttle down!
"jack, we'd like to know if you think you can adjust the high gain as close to plus 15 and yaw 190 as possible?"
"say, gordy, are we clear to jettison the buddy slss bag, now?"
"i wanted to put it back on here, pete."
"okay. would you give me get of o.05g again, please?"
"okay. let's start with the - the lspe. all eight charges have now been exploded, and they were all on schedule and produced excellent sig- nals. these data were used in conjunction with the ascent stage lift-off and also its impact data, which should give us an excellent picture of the geologic structure of the outer 3 kilo- meters of the moon. this little summary i'm reading right now is - was written by joel watkins. the geophone array is functioning beautifully and and we're already talking about its potential in a listening mode for study of meteorite impact fre- quency. we still don't have precise ep locations from ray batson, so the following interpretation will almost certainly be changed when we get better data and field tapes, which we will use to refine our arrival times. bearing the above in mind, my preliminary interpretation is as follows. the low-velocity layer seems to be thicker and higher in velocity than at either apollo 14 or 16 sites. i think this may mean that the low-velocity layer here includes dark mantle material as well as the regolith. details of the higher velocity substrata are fuzzy, but velocities increase with depth in a way which would be consistent with a thick ac- cumulation of lava flows. this probably repre- sents the suhfloor material. and he concludes by saying, ""you guys did a great job, see you after splash."" on the same subject, dr. kovach went a little further, and he just recently admits to seeing evidence of two high-velocity layers, especially after the 6-pound charge was fired, that - that evidence showed up. he also mentions in - mentioned in his press conference yesterday that the - the data point allowed by the - the ascent-stage impact was - was very important - the fact that they - they got it in about 9 kilo- meters away and the - that data is right in a critical range where - where they see a big change in the - the percentage of - velocity change. i'm getting kind of balled up here in the words, but that data is very important because it's in - where the steep gradient of velocity change occurs. on looking through here, t guess, in - in summary, i'll read a couple of sentences again out of the press conference. we do find evidence of lunar crust as we did in the past, but we may have to thin it considerably. we may have, in fact, have to thin it as much as to 25 kilometers instead of 60 - that they believed it was up until now. and they're thinking they may have to lower the veloc- ity of seismic ways - waves in the mantle, which, i guess, at last guess was around 9 kilometers per second. now it's looking more like 7.5, and the crustal velocity is probably as low as 6.3 kilo- meters per second. okay, yes. that was - that last data was really from dr. latham, and he was f interpreting that data mainly from the s-ivb impact and readings from some of the other seismic sites. any questions on that? i realize that this is pretty ragged. over."
"okay, i hear you. and, houston, every latch has - worked perfectly."
"okay, joe. stand by."
...
"well, you can turn it off and let's see."
"columbia, houston. over."
"okay. now, turn - you got to stand - can you stand up straight?"
"okay. okay, jack, they're both in."
"isn't that amazing? copy that, houston?"
"aquarius, houston."
"okay, master arm is on. i've got two good lights."
"okay. logics, off."
"that's affirm. and the approach at tpf is going to be right along the local horizontal. 07 03 53 25 cdr-i_ okay, thanks for the information, houston. i think if radar's working good, and we get a good solution, we will probably stay heads up and go ahead and accept the breaklock."
"okay, charlie."
"dave, we think you might be about to run out of film."
"his ulcer is what makes it - - l0 00 43 20 cml° that's going to be true in any job you go to. there's probably more talented people working in msc, and working with nasa, than in any other organization, per capita, unless you get some little group like bellcomm or something where - and they got their share of them. strange. l0 00 43 56 iatp (heavy breathing) ... over there."
hit pro.
"we'll see if it - if it - should be a - a - main- tain. and it should go barber pole when you put it up, and it should hold barber pole until it's launched, and then it should go back to gray."
*** that big rock. just cleared it. which one are you going to park in?
"america, houston."
"11, houston. do you read? over."
what a joy! too much ...
"that's correct. now verb 37, enter; 52, enter; option 1."
"yes. we're just trying to find the right - right crater, houston."
"roger. the time to start the maneuver is 24 - 247 _-_ plus 36. 10 05 43 03 cml° i understand. 247 plus 36. roger. thank you, karl."
and we have a master - and a master alarm.
"got the pad for p12, jim? 04 08 45 23 l_p yes. 0_ 08 45 32 i2,'[p 104:50:49.67 get. 04 08 46 03 i_(p okay, plus 55, 158, plus 195."
probably that - 04 17 48 19 lm_ it's the door handle. i got it loose now.
"no, why don't you save it. let's document it. it's - -"
"yes, i guess you did copy them."
"okay. well, this attitude we passed you is not quite alined to the tez_ninator, and stand by on this."
"okay. that - within the dead band, that's as close as i can keep y and z."
"apollo 11, houston. we'll have los 81 45, next aos - stand by."
"ail right, go ahead."
good work.
"yes, it doesn't look like it rolled -"
"i think that did it. now try it. 05 ll o0 48 _{p no. something's catching on it, al. o_ il o0 58 cdr *** it off. 05 11 00 59 _<p huh?"
ail right.
yes. we're learning. i hope my bag was closed. yours was. did you get it?
"no, i couldn't see it. okay. go ahead."
"okay, i'll handle it. yeah. i recommend they enjoy it as much as we did. i'm sure they will, because, i tell you, we really have - we really have had a lot of sights to see. i'll admit that, in a lot of cases, we worked hard, and - and i suppose the people on the ground were able to tell that. but we got all the support in the world from the mcc-houston. i - i mean, i could tell, from every decision that came up from the ground, that - that there was a lot of work put into it. and all around the country that there were a lot of wheels 11 _ page 515 turning and people working late hours and solving these problems. and i'm just really happy that ken, charlie, and myself got to do this. and i think it's a wonderful experience."
okay.
sir? okay. here's the flight plan. we're doing what we're supposed to be doing for a change.
"okay. and a refninder, jack, to keep talcing your rover photos."
"and then you get the aot clamps off the utility lights and open the clamp jaws to max. and you stow the clamps, and you roll up the paper - roll up the - roll up your fender shortwise and put a gray tab over that and stow it in the etb. you got both the clamps and the paper fender in the etb. and then when you get out to the rover, you lay the edge of your fender over the inboard guide rail and clamp it, and then you lay the other edge of the sheet over the outboard rail and clamp it. and the only thing you're - really have to worry about is making sure that the inboard clamp is right over the shock strut so that you don't get any interference with the lrv structure when you turn the wheel."
you got to move the camera.
look.
"no, i'll get it. i knew there was something i needed to do."
"yes, that's correct, jack; they're pretty simple. about halfway through the procedure, we have a step on panel 3, which is power ampl, high; we'd like to change that to power ampl, low."
yeah.
go ahead.
- - and get a couple of cores from you.
"the propellant is at 210; the fuel manifold at - and ox manifold is - correction, make it 215 - or 220. and everything else looks pretty good. pressures are holding up - you think the burst"
"good show, ron."
i sure will. okay. lift vector up. reverse at 56.
"ignition, houston. attitude looks good, engine override is on, mast_ arm is off. we got a descent quantity light on at ignition - -"
want to put your protective visor down?
no.
shade.
"columbia, houston in the blind. request high gain. pitch minus 30, yaw plus 170. over."
okay. 04 15 24 18 ir_p i'll hold it. you open the packet up. 04 15 24 b9 cdr ... that'd kill us. just hold it right there. okay. let the pocket go. 04 15 24 49 _ about through?
"well, shoot, just 1."
okay. when i first put in the - -
on.
shall we do that at lift-off minus 107
is that right?
"what did the ground say? 07 08 01 01 imp the ground says minus 77.6 - plus 77.6, plus 3.8--"
"okay. i just wanted to talk over with you, it looks like we've had some changes in the flight plan here, due to jim's. p52. do you have - can you talk over with me what your plans are?"
"hey, that sounds real interesting."
"okay, houston. i'm back in the service module sep attitude."
"okay. 04 03 46 29 l_l_ that's what it says, pitch up."
bet you're going to get yourself in a box there.
okay. let's get the probe out of here.
"okay, dick .... you look at yours, and i'll just make sure i got all these things put away."
"... leave that ... right where it is. now, where's the tv now, ..."
"yes. every time. okay, let's go."
let it bleed down. okay. it's closed.
*** with it back there?
i copy that.
very good.
"okay. that part's al] right, jack. and we had - ab6ut 11 or 12 steps for the command mod- ule. they go as is with no change. and then we had a couple of more procedures for the lm. stand by 1."
okay.
okay. i guess you got your update.
we got it. iconfidential
"i'm doing it from the needles. if you don't ro - if you haven't rolled from the last way you were doing it, we were doing it okay."
okay. i can - think we can cover that.
"bob, does that mean we can go ahead with the urine dump on schedule?"
...
"ll, houston. we've got the load in. you can go back to block. over."
"okay, it says, ""rate gyro test."" suit circuit - well, wait a minute."
"yes, that's all right. i got that picture, anyway. okay. radar test, landing. you ready?"
"apollo 11, _is houston. you are go for ryroarm. "" g."

okay; we copy.
okay. we've still got a water separator light in here.
"yes, sir. yes, sir. thank you, joe."
"huh? yes, i suppose we ought to think about doing that. we can get to all that stuff now."
"casper, could you give us auto on the high ga2n? 06 05 32 30 c_'_ okay. how about that?"
"i guess there's some old friends you ,lus_hate _o _et rid of, pete."
roger. we copy. stand by.
okay. no problem. we're just - just wondered what we had there.
okay. shutdown.
"oh, shoot. they're missing all of it."
i mean affirm. get my terminology straight here.
"okay, still setting on 300, and no warning tone."
fire.
we've got tv.
roger. good - -
"okay. let's go over the cue cards. okay. delta-v check's complete. set the delta-v 2981.4. okay. we have the pre-delta-v in standby. and the sim bay's been checked, jack? limp yes, it's been checked ...."
no.
"okay. very good. _4p-eva now, that's not a complete lining. it just - there seems to be glass agglutinates, if you will - that's holding the fragments in the bottom of the crater together. there's one on the side of an older crater. we're back into about a 1-percent coverage. i suspect that the reason we - our block population went up there was because of bronte."
"well, at least we don't have a sideslope. battery covers stay closed?"
very good. go ahead.

"roger, ed. discontinue the check and go _ead with your post-eva systems configuration. 04 22 38 06 _p okay."
yeah. 09 21 53 25 _ they got - they got a new model for the - the cayley. they said it - oops! - they say it's slosh - it's a slosh from imbrium.
who's shining in the sunlight?
"okay, let me try to get auto without waking him. stand by."
"ail right. take the main regs, two, open."

roger. understand you're on omni charlie.
huh?
"gordy, why don't you go ahead and load it yourself when you send up the vector?"
"funny, i can notice that tv camera on my back. it moves my c.g. further in."

"under that, deadband, max; and attitude control, three, to pulse."
okay.
"it's ekg, john."

"yes, is it there?"

what do you want?
"they want you to go to aft, charlie."
i got them now.
"not long enough, yet."
yes.
turn it on. you got the switch. cml: okay.

"roger. and just a couple of additional comments here. the p20 attitude is going to differ slightly from what you've got in the flight plan, due to the fact;that we're using a different tei refsmmat. it's;a very small change and probably not very significant. but we didn't want it to surprise you. and the tei rev is different, of course. that's going to give us a slightly different termi- nator, so we've been advised that you can turn the mapping camera and the pan camera on a couple or three minutes early, if you'd like since we got a lot of film. 08 07 41 39 cy_ okay. we'll put those things on as soon as it's practical. and you - did you want to change the noldi 78 load, or are you just saying that that will give us a different set of gimbal angles?"
