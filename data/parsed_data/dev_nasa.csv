you want to take that for me?
okay. there were those mounds mapped over at phantom area. can you see those - -
"- - magnetometer reading. station 5 there is 125 g_unma down; the alsep site was 230 g_mma - correction - up; the alsep site was 230 gamma down; and spook was 180 down. hey, john. do you have switch position 17"
"okay. we're just about ready to turn out the lights. by m_watch, about 7:20 in the morning is wakeu p time, and i got the other guys on their couches and i'm going to stand the duty tonight and i'm going to leave my lightweight headset in my ear. but if the high gain bothers me during this ptc, i want to go ahead and take it out. and i've got the tone booster connected up and it does work. so, in any event, give me a crew alert in the morning, will you?"
affirm.
roger.
"hey, charlie, i can see the snow on the moun- tains out in california, and it looks like la doesn't have much of a smog problem today."
"okay; john, i guess we'll try to get to it some- time tomorrow, maybe."
"okay. 04 2b 01 32 cdr-eva okay, the heading when i put the nav power breaker in, bob, was 2b - 234. 04 2b o1 40 cc okay, i copy that. we'll torque that to 279."
do that right now?
"apollo 11, houston. we have about 4 minutes los. that makes a0s 98 18. over."
okay.
both weigh the same ...
okay. stable at 39.
"go ahead, houston."
(laughter)
dick? i'm going to let a1 get out of here before i suit up.
hold it and i'll get a bunch of these frags right here.
"okay, davy. and are those frags?"
"keep reading to me. direct 02, on."
"okay, 17, that's a great stop. that was _¥ mis- take, i was reading the hole-in-the-wall coordinave."
that's r_ght.
"okay, vance. first we are going to give you a shot of the sleep station."
okay. let me slide right over here. that's a new one.
"yes. 04 22 46 47 cer ecs: lcg pump breaker, closed. 04 22 46 49 izmp closed."
"well, ... be back ..."
"okay, pete."
"no, lot of work to do ..."
get the locator.
"oh, this is a beauty."
"okay. i would be glad to do it, if i thought it would give you any data. but i can't see how it'll give you anything you could use."
"in looking at the tv, it appears we'll be leaving the tv off for this, so if you would take the - keep that circuit breaker out and go to s-band mode, pm."
stand by.
"battery covers stay closed. but we do want the lcru, and the tv camera, and the tcu dusted. ·cdr-eva 0kay."
"good readback, ron. and the earthshine photo pad is at 121:05 in the flight plan. _p okay. stand by just a second. 121:05, huh?"
challenger; houston. i have a new ags k factor for you.
"karl, we've all got our eyes closed. we're pulling our feet up."
"no, that's the - the second. look at the earth; isn't that sharp, pete conrad?"
"yes, i turned it off. i turned it off. okay. let me see. we want to move on to 7 here. rake, talus, doc_nented core, you got your stereos, we got two pans, tge, camera. okay, we're going to head east and look for station 7 - block variation, contact change, and get a different sample of rocks. okay, i sure want to get one or two of those nice ones in the big bag while you're over there."
okay.
... about a year before the flight.
shit.
"okay. yes, we see those."
okay. yeah; okay.
"yes, sir. and if my homefront's listening, i just want to say good night and sleep tight."
change arms here.
"hey, john, could you spin around here? ... behind you."
"it_a+_'sright 05 21 33 1_ cdr _our, in; one, out."
"besides we can he - in fact, it's early."
"15, houston. we have your torquing angles."
pictures in here. okay.
"question 4: several times at north ray you men- tioned, ""don't get too close to the edge."" did you think that if you had fallen in, you wouldn't have been able to get out?"
..... north - -
shoot a 500 while you're doing that. (laughter)
"it looks like it's just a bit to the west of manila there - about 5 or 6 degrees, no more than that. abo_. it looks like it's about 5 degrees west of manila and asout 5 degrees south. and it is still called theresa."
i didn't call you_ joe.
"did you ever get the picture of the _ and earth? 05 15 t0 25 _p no. 05 15 10 4_ cdr oh, that's a shame."
okay. stand by.
"by gosh, loud and clear there."
*** many of these pieces as we can. i don't know how many are going to come out. 06 ]8 _._17 l_°-eva (laughter)
roger. standby.
"that would be an awful thing, wouldn't it? go for 4 days without comm and trail in there to the second at ... 5g.... the sext stars all up. is that on that pad?"
"go. and 50 - no, make that 60 on the oxidizer. 1-22 ___g_'__q_e_ / z day 5"
roger. i think we can make them out. the color really enhances our ability to discern features and craters over what we see in real time on our black and white monitor.
okay. we copy that. what do you nctice?
that's - that's probably - -
"you know, i want to take a picture upslope, dave, but i can't. i can't get the camera pointed up that way."
all righty. and you - -
- - pick up a - -
"okay, let me look it over here for a second. at first glance, the first thing i see here looks like - do i - should i ...?"
"not significantly. i could get down to about (tranq) the first 2 inches without much of a problem, and then as i would pound it in about as hard as i could do it, and the second one took two hands on the han_ner, and i was putting pretty good dents in the top of the extension rod, and it just wouldn't go much more than - i think the total depth might haye been about 8 oz 9 inches. but even there, it didn't - for some reason it didn't seem to want to stand up straight. in other words, i'd keep driving it in and it would dig some sort of a hole but it wouldn't - just penetrate in a way that would support it and keep it from falling over, if that makes any sense at all. it didn't really to me. over."
"we'll have them for you in a minute, ii."
can you get the core stem bag?
you got - you got anything on the tv?
"good night, robert."
take number 3.
are you steering on all four wheels? 05 04 51 44 imp-eva yep.
"yes, sir, john. you're loud and clear."
"are you dirty yourself, or you - -"
go ahead.
roger. it's nothing leaking; it's just the paint itself.
okay - -
roger.
"that's correct, dave, and we're standing by for the other additions you've made, now."
o'kay. at your convenience we have an item to give you which will have to be copied. it's information on how to photograph comet bennett at time 32 hours get. over.
"roger. in other words, you're asking to confirm that it does come full out."
"okay, understand. circuit breakers sps, 10, closed."
"got a cassette going out the window, there. okay, it's clear."
"okay, i get number 4, which - where is it? is that the one on the ground?"
"okay. very good. can't see the checklist, that's all."
okay. i can give you my time with that - ... time - 97:54:55.
yes. 0001 54 39 lmp ... - with the 105 lens.
"okay. we got a number of interesting ideas on that and the latest one i've heard is to power up the lm platform and aline it, and aline the cm platform to it."
"okay; might fine, joe."
"hello, houston. this is america; loud and clear."
okay; 348.
"casper, r-3 should be minus 00014."
"give me the setting, al."
go ahead.
roger.
"houston, 15."
"roger, al."
"okay. 02 10 28 30 i_mp houston, we're starting a - 02 purge."
okay.
okay; we copy that.
"eagle and columbia, this is the backup crew. our congratulations for yesterday's performance, and our prayers are with you for the rendezvous. over."
okay.
you going to put the tv internal tonight after we show the moon?
"okay, dave. we're loud - loud and clear on both, and we're go for the next step. f- 05 21 52 23 cdr-i_m okay. my plss 02 quantity is 90 percent. how about yours, jim?"
"and, 15; houston. if one of you has some time, we'd like to talk about some stowage, please."
"ail right. under ""cm rcs checks,"" the fourth line down says ""manual attitude, three, to mini- mum impulse."" we'll have to use ""accel command"" and the reason for that, jack, is we don't have the sps powered up so there's no minimum impulse generator. ta_' _5/'_'_1"
"yeah, i want to write on that i defecated at 200 and whatever it is."
yes.
"and one other thing that - when we put those sta_e vectors in there, i guess we didn't have any - the lm vector in there and my computer activity light stayed on all the time. i finally figured out what it was and did a verb 66 and got rid of it."
"okay, bob. the gravimeter's on the surface. and you want a gravity reading and a bias reading, is that correct?"
"okay, that's plus 2.68, plus 109.19, plus 5.03."
"i think it's too short, dave, it - for - -"
i'll give you a time hack on the get at 75 hours 37 minutes and i'll try that bias at about a second and a half to allow for the time of flight.
"roger, dave - -"
roger. we found it.
"the angles are good; it's got to know where it is, doesn't it? better just keep you eye on that flag - -"
i got all the surveyor stuff. we - we were leaping over that lunar surface like a freaking bunch of gazelles.
okay. okay. in work.
...
"boy, i just had a couple of bites; it's really good."
"ooops. no, i can't now. i'm busy driving."
"right. then it says, press reg b to - press reg a to egress. 03 23 55 41 imp okay, go."
"i got to secure it before we go to sleep, anyhow, i imagine. bat c charging?"
okay. that was going to be a question of mine.
"say, are we going to have a pretty good view of the earth out of any csm windows at the lm checkout altitude ?"
and the clock is starting.
"hello, apollo 11. houston. we recommend you accept the noun 49. continue through your sequence of sightings, and then we'll analyze the data afterwards. over."
okay.
you set the dap?
i'm working ...
"affirmative. break. clipper, houston with a map update, rev 14."
okay. give us about 5 to finish fixing dinner here. it takes a while.
give us the lexan. 00 00 28 57 cmp/cdr yes. !
switch them. okay. let's fire on the mission timer.
"roger. we copy, neil. would you say again the delta-v ? we missed that. over. z 03 08 36 _2 cdr roger. that was minus 0.1."
roger.
"okay, the gdc looks like it's - pretty much - i'm gonna dress it up .... has nothing to do with the uncaged gyro. it's the attitude reference. okay."
roger. recommend you continue ptc until 55 hours. over.
okay.
okay. everything's stieky-poo.
"- - it's - it's according to the flight plan, barber pole plus 2 seconds."
was henry on the night when i got - got all n_ transients? i'm gonna have that guy fired.
mark. duke - upper right eye - a fuzzy flash.
okay. tf - what's delta-vc? minus 10?
"page 14, right-hand side, near the bottom under ""orbital science,"" scratch out ""verify dse on,"" and also delete ""visual target 3 on track 180 plus 19,"" and cross out the penned-in ""d5."""
just velcro it back up here somewhere. ·
... the lm mode?
"looks straight to me, john. okay, here's your picture."
"yes, turn - -"
okay; four items. i'm just marking down four marks here.
"okay, babe. that's about all i can do for you. 0kay, get my antenna. oh, i think all the dust i took off you went on me."
that's good news. i guess i qualify.
i ain't r - quite ready for it yet.
"and now, we get to put your purge in 208."
okay.
let's get going.
"on the other side? 06 21 30 33 ijip-eva no, this side. f"
"okay. after that, cb cte, main b, to close. next, panel 250: cb bat c bat charge/eds2 to close; cb bat c power entry/postlanding to close. next, panel 275: cb main b, bat bus b, to close; cb inverter power 2, main b, to close. okay. incidentaljy_ a_y_hing thst !'ye given you up until now is not sequence critical, but from now on, it should be - you should be sure to do it in the sequence we give you. why don't you read that back, jack?"
"okay, jim. i - i got your camera. great. how many pictures does that take?"
"at 7 minutes, you're looking great to u. , eagle. 04 06 40 !3 lmp okay. i'm still on slew so we may tend to lose (eagle) as we gradually pitch over. let me try auto again now and see what happens."
"okay, ed."
"yes, there's ... zero phase. yes, i can see aristarchus. i think that must be aristarchus. way back over to the north."
okay.
"okay. minus 0.6, plus 0.2, plus 0.7."
do you?
do you want to make a bet on that one?
"670, 049, 701; 670, 049, 701."
yes. (laughter).
we only got 20 minutes here. i'll start the pan.
"okay, jim. we've come up with a comm recommen- dation which we hope will save some power by powering down the power amplifier, if it works. and i'd like to read up the steps to you and have you think about them for a minute, and we recommend trying it before the first yaw maneuver. over."
okay. copy.
"roger, houston. just reporting that the gamma ray boom retract time was 3 plus 07."
the interconnects. three of them.
"america, houston. suggest you try to get the high gain up at a pitch of 10; yaw, 210."
"and, america. your cabin press is at 5.6, and you can crack the side hatch valve, if you like."
what?
"now just swing into that depression and i'll put it there. beautiful. okay. oh, whoo."
"that's affirmative. and we copied 37, 37, 37, 87, 92, 93, and 96."
okay ·
"yes, all that stuff is getting - there, it's fixed. lnp-eva get your hook back."
"yes. yes, we've got all the cameras up."
"okay. you think - is that a door that extends - if you're standing in the shoes - that ex_ends out the bottom of the sim bay or one vhat extends out - if you're striding on the shoes - it wouia be one _he - extending on the left side of the sim bay? cdr-]_ yes. it extends out the left side towards uhe front of the spacecraft do_n in the bottoia left- hand corner, if you're standing in the shoes, t;o you don'_ - -"
okay.
got a little bit of an x-axis accelerometer but very slight. changing very slowly.
"yeah, it was terrific; how i know it. want to go ahead with the checklist changes or you want to - me to don my suit? 04 21 20 h6 cc i'm trying to get an answer here."
okay. i'm going to raise the rad - radio antenna - red flag.
"okay, pete. i've got the target."
okay. understand.
"well, we're not through with you, gene, so don't throw yourself too far."
"*** we're not really in that bo_alder territory, yet."
"okay. that's the first clear word we heard from you, jack. do you think it could be my pitch attitude that's breaking up your incoming? i guess you've been hearing us."
you want to get your antenna?
"okay, and we do have your needle. *** your needle."
"i remember a guy who once said ""dirt dirt"" and it is [sic] ever! pshew!"
"let me know when you get up there because i've got to turn my 02 off. well, i guess i can see it from here."
got to hold it until the pressure decreases. ail sorts of junk going out there.
"okay, jack. we're reading you loud and clear right now. oh, you're going out a little bit now."
and i'm happy; i like it.
"okay, jim. understand you have the pad. sps/g&n; 36363; plus 0.61, plus 0.93; 192:13:33.30; plus 2799.7, plus 0609.5, minus 0098.0; 181, ll2, 0.15. rest of the pad na. ullage: 4 jet, 12 seconds. over."
"okay. landing radar, closed."
"yes, i did yesterday."
... just a little ...
"okay. tony, if that thing fell off, the ses - the sesc was in it."
huh?
"... again. 04 05 lb 40 cdr okay, ken. you're at 370 feet, b60 - 370 feet at - still at 2."
...
"roger. and i got a couple of other thi2_gs, mike. we need to terminate battery b charge ay this time, and also, the weather is clobbering in at our targeted landing point due to scatt_._red thunderstorms. we don't want to tangle w_th one of those, so we are going to move the - your aim point uprange. ccrrection, it will be downrange, to target for 1500-nautical-i ile entry so we can guarantee uplift control. the aew coordinates are 13 degrees, 19 minul es north, 169 10 minutes west. _he weather in that area is super. we got 2000 scattered, 8000 _cattered sith l0 miles visibility and 6-foot se_ and the hornet is sitting [n great position to get lo that targeted posit [on. over. (goss net 1) tape 117/4"
"jim, that sounds good or it could be the large one to the northwest of rhysling. rhysling may be coming up on your left now."
don't turn it over.
"yes. that's why i - i've got to get through this field, though."
okay.
looks just like it did before.
yeah; not until i get out there.
"roger, al. the message to you is to stand by to copy your final-exam grade in orbital science and observation. it's an alfa plus, with a subnote of ""well done."" over."
"well, we can start one."
copy that.
"okay, got you. ob 20 21 18 lmp okay, that's good."
control power is on .... delta-v thrust a switch. get it and es at 30 seconds. ullage - no ullage.
it's gonna start pulling that range off.
okay. go ahead.
negative. we got different high gain settings - -
he just doesn't know what an iss light will do to a boy.
"17, you read houston? over."
"you know, that's the way it happens"
"roger. roger. that is affirmative, ard we moved that switch to the open position_ and they went back to gray. over. 00 03 33 []9 cc roger. 00 03 37 ql cc apollo 11, this is houston. over."
jack's complaining about seeing stars.
"okay. 04 o_ 51 55 cmp okay, that,s about a foot."
who's sitting over there reminding me of all these good things this morning?
"up is up, and down is down."
okay.
"okay, charlie. fan is off, off. comm is off, pump's off."
"okay. the primary desire will be the north massif, the blocks, and the trail. *** gravimeter off again, and we'll *** surface measurement here, as well, to check against the rover."
orion. roger.
"okay, i'll do that. 12 06 27 42 i24p houston, this is apollo 15 on simplex a."
okay. it looked real good. go ahead.
okay. okay; hold off. better get the cabin down to - so i can open it partial here.
51007 and minus 021.
good show.
"go ahead, jack."
roger.
"apollo 13, houston."
but the rake?
"okay, we'll stand by on a call on the retraction and got the score 10 to nothing."
"yes, karl, i think if there was a problem that time, it was because i hesitated just momentarily, thinking i had it free, and i ended up in hold."
roger. (laughter)
"casper, omni charlie."
"we're going to have to go down like the way we came because there's that big crater down at the bottom, i'm afraid."
"houston, we've got the cabin back up some now, and our lm/cm delta-p gage is reading 0.6_ and that's probably due to that delta on _he cabin° and the 02 flow high light has gons out, so things are getting back to normal. /r"
very good.
"okay. and the question beyond that, is there velcro to hold one of those flaps down or not?"
"copy that, jack."
"15 seconds. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15."
"okay, we've got a ton of the_. we'll get them for you."
didn't stop it in time?
"need some light? (_q) , ,_ 04 13 04 26 _' it's unlocked, yes. _,_"
"mark. right between the two eyes, seemed like. both spots."
"we're going to light your fire today, babe."
okay; it's retracting now.
"i don't think i can read that unless i dust it with a lens brush - okay. get my - okay, can i get by you here?"
"okay, pressing on. s-band antenna - -"
"well, let's make it 30 centimeters down from the rim."
- - is to take the dust brush with you back to the lm.
okay; 11841.
"off the - ooo, is that soft and queasy. hey, that's neat. i don't sink in too far. i'll try a little - boy, that sun's bright. that's just like somebody - shining a spotlight on your hand."
it's coming up real easy.
"yeah, that what comes with 2000 hours under your belt."
"supposed to have on ... yes, except ... 07 02 58 03 _ ... as far away from here as ..."
okay.
"""start: 119:34:33; stop: 121:33:02."" and a note to that is that the - the - the extend/ retract times on the mapping camera seem to be getting longer with time, and, until further notice, we'd like for you to record and send down the delta-t on each extend and retract."
"okay, well, we got it off."
shoot no. never.
okay; i'll have to check that myself. we're on rev 25. he's about three-quarters of the way across the front side. coming up back side will start 26.
you bet. the ems is all set.
"aca/4 jet, two, enable."
"okay. 04 00 52 45 imp we ain't got a steerable antenna. okay, houston, we have you on the aft omni. okay, is zero zero set in up there, john?"
"there's a big rock in there, huh? 0kay, there you go. okay."
"okay. okay, joe. we're mov - moving now. 06 o1 22 _7 cc okay, dave. and, jim, if you can easily turn the camera on, might be a good place."
"that looks like it'd be okay, doesn't it?"
see if that helps.
"hello, orion; this is houston."
roger. we're watching it.
*** down in a hole now.
okay.
getting there - kilter. ah.
"we'll do that. just grab a bunch, huh?"
beautiful. 03 22 04 35 lb_ what's your problem?
the pitch steering needle.
"okay. i've gotj3·7. no, let me give a little more."
"okay. and for your informat_ion, all of our numbers are based on amperage usage of 14 amps. and we're using only 12.3, so we're a little fat on our analysis."
"oh, yes. yes. yes. if i wanted to get technical, something's blocking them. that's right."
plus 09411- -
"and there's some beautiful north overhangs all around the block. well, (laughter) on the north side of the block."
"okay, dave. we are interested in your starting to drill. we've got a lot of power left in the drill, just run it around several times, and don't bear down on it too much, let's - how free, or how freely, it moves in the surficial layer there, first of all."
"hey, houston, cabin repress is back to both now - i mean _e_ergeiicycabin repress."
"(cough) bob, this is jack. i'm going to try and get a little exercise. i'd be interested to know how high i can get my heart rate just fooling around up here."
"bmag mode, three, att 1/rate 2. 03 ll 18 48 cnp att 1/rate 2."
"okay. on my trusty watch, i had about 3-3/4 seconds long."
"roger. _ 09 23 52 45 cdr well, houston, i guess that it's a good reason we're about an hour ahead. so we'll go ahead and dig it out."
"okay, our - -"
very diplomatic.
"yes. lets get out of this little boulder field -- first. okay, now we'll take a little left here. oh well, we can look at pluton. we'll see pluton tape95/27 all the way. and the lm is silhouetted right against the base of - pluton so we can't miss that. f_ and just to the right of it is - schaber hill which we'll be heading for tomorrow. okay, by the way, joe, i guess we ought to tell you about what we saw at that last stop. we gathered a few quick samples that were covered with dust, which we didn't look at very carefully, just so we could get ahold of them. then the very large boulder, which was probably about 6 feet, sticking up out of the ground, with a very large 3- to 4-inch vesicles, was a very fine-grained, dark, black, basalt, with maybe - gee, i'd say 15-percent plage in it, wouldn't you, jim?"
"they sure splay around under this one-sixth g, don't they? it's moving around a bunch ...."
"okay. understand you're sitting on 30, ready to take n_rmher 30. and you've got 11 pictures left."
roger.
"nell, this is houston. neil, this is houston. radio check. over."
okay. give us about 5 minutes.
roger. we'll have the fido's work that one up for you momentarily.
light on.
yes.
what's that?
okay. i'm below 5.
"17, houston."
yeah.
"yeah. okay, there it comes. man, that's a big haul up there."
"okay, 74:18 is los."
cappy - copy frame 31.
"okay, how we doing on the heading, jimmer?"
roger. we've got a tv.
"okay, where am i? i_p-eva you're doing a gravimeter, getting the flag. i've got your camera. i'm going to salvage the scissors."
"aquarius, houston. select forward 0mni. over. 03 01 04 26 imp ..."
roger. how did everything go?
"okay, we got all three of them off now. right, gordy?"
"okay, ken, we copied that, although you faded out at the end. we'll be up on hawaii here at 44."
"that's a good idea, houston - -"
"yes, sir. 09 03 28 37 lap fifteen seconds it's been open. 09 03 28 39 cml° been open 15 or 20 now."
"america, houston. we're about 3 minutes until los and everything is looking great. no changes since our go for doi. we'll expect to see you at 93:34:24."
"yes. that's right. you'_ have had to to see that. when we get on that boat in that mqf, we'll just sit down there and really list all that shit. 07 21 15 25 _ i don't think ..."

if i can jump up to the third ring [sic]. *** i'm gonna do here is jump. there we go.
"apollo 11, apollo 11, this is houston through aria 4. radio check. over."
"yes, he'll ... follow those numbers. as long as we're in free, it don't really make any difference whether you got p30 running or not, as far as p20 is concerned. anyway, they don't care about it as long as we don't run it more than a half an hour."
"charlie, do - don't get too close to that, and watch out for the battery cable. 05 23 16 33 ii,p-eva i - i see that; it's just this rover deploy cable i was in. there. there, i'm okay. okay, we're ready fop the loadup, and i'll swap cameras with you. _** put yours on your seat, john. where'd those bags go that you had? you got them?"
okay. falcon's going to yaw left. _' end of tape apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription
okay. i'm trying to.
yes.

okay. i'm sorry. i misinterpreted the words there. i should have gotten that. forget that on_.
say again?
"okay, from zero, you're on number k."
okay.
"okay. good. nice to talk with you. hey, i don't know whether you were around, gene, the other day when i was talking about the circulation patterns around antarctica. we were looking then at the indian ocean - actually, south atlantic in the indian ocean region. and you see the same pattern at about the same latitude, say 60 degrees south, where all the linear cloud patterns which presum- ably are - reflect the various cold fronts have - are arcuate with their convex sides, or more actually, almost pointed sides are all lined up in a west-to-east direction around that latitude. it's quite a spectacular appearing circulation pattern. and the little wave that i mentioned on new zealand seems to be beginning to form another arrow or another convex point on that front that's fitting right into the same circulation pattern."
"roger, challenger. you're loud and clear, and both systems look good. you're righ_ on the line."
"okay, the cm rcs logic, on, up."
"roger. we're going to go ahead and e'aable the s-ivb for the slingshot maneuver. t?e lox d_l will start about 12 minutes from now. over. 00 04 49 49 c.wp 0kay, lox dump about - i guess that']l make it about 01, huh?"
"by golly you're right. we just went by it, didn't we. oh, well, we have to skip some of the things up here, i guess. 06 07 31 20 cdr-i_m okay, houston, hadley base here. we're ready to talk about the etb."
"houston, 15. go ahead."
"okay; well, i'm not sure this clock is right. did it start on the time? 00 02 35 ob cdr i wasn't watching it, ken. o0 02 35 06 cml° well, i just wa_ to know if there's difference at the mark."
i'll leave it in slew. relay to us. see if they (eagle) have got me now. i've got good signal strength in slew.
and the next map - mapping camera pad is at 125:30.
"roger, gene."
okay.
still got the quantity light on.
okay.
"it wasn't? why? really? oh, let me write this 216 day"
"why don't we hook up the speakers, and let's do some checking ...."
"ags on. is it running? yes, it's running. okay, 55. 55, 56, 57, 58, 59 -"
"okay, emergency register working."
for the biggest landing of your life.
"i guess, hank, i ought to be passing flamsteed now."
"that isn't what i was trying to say, ken."
"another thing, jim, is while you're maneuvering to that attitude using _ to control --_.......-. if you find out enroute to that attitude tltv you didn't quite have the yaw where you wanzed it to be, you can use your aca and tweak up !he yaw, and your ags needles go right back to zero because you zero the attitude errors."
roger. i'm enabled.
"okay. the logic's coming on. number 1, on; num- ber 2 - that's - two logics are on."
"here's mag hotel in your camera, and i can't get off; you might work on that while i drive*** ... hey, hey jim, would you check my lowers - lower hooks on my plss. are they hooked?"
"where? i don't see it. o1 08 37 25 cs well, i bumped it, and it's just - coming all over me. okay. now what do you want out of a-27"
"okay, charlie. we got a little roll drift in the gdc and a little yaw drift, but we don't have a heck of a lot of other, and it's - goldang, it's been running for 50 minutes, and it's off 5 degrees in yaw - 5 degrees in yaw - and we're on rate 2, so you don't really know. and 2 degrees in pitch - heck, i'll take that. and - and 8 degrees in roll for 50 minutes. that's with the bmags ... that ain't really all that bad."
"that's correct.,z circuit breaker eps sensor unit, ac 1 and 2/,/closed."

"thav has a hint of bedrock, but it's - and that's about on the southwest rim - about 20 percent down from the upper rim of palmetto, tony."
you're looking at it.
"okay, your get is 152 plus 20."
"say again, jim."
"cb, direct ullage, two, close."
"okay. hold the zoom there, and the position looks good, also."
"yes, it's falling apart as you pick it up. very crumbly, isn't it?"
"roger. let's try the ia_a_t omi again, please. 07 07 16'21 cc 15, houston."
"okay, houston. boresighted the - the earth, dark side and all."
"220:13, pan camera to operate at t-start."
"unhook it here. f- 05 06 05 02 cdr-eva and then let me hang up the lec, here."
"well, this place looks like a pigpen - you've run the same course everyone else has, i guess."
"roger, verified."
"houston, 15. go ahead."
"hey, houston. by the way, you got tv picture down there."
"gordy, the forward hatch is unlocked."
"there we've got you, charlie. 06 23 lh 15 cdr-eva the outer surface of that rock is dust covered. it appears to be a really black clasts that's going into 385."

okay; are you reading me now?
no ....
okeydoke.
"well, we've got to get these return items out of here. stow in the isa - big pocket."
yeah. 00 03 06 33 cml° okay.
"if you see a blue one winking, you'd better pull over."
"are you ready to send it up, vance?"
"boy, oh, boy!"
telescope? or sextant?
"challenger, houston. we see you heading toward gimbal lock. over."
"yes, we're heading 360; the bearing's 340; and the range 1.5."
roger.
"okay. let me just doublecheck. drape, contingency, unstow aft deployment cable, verify walking hinge, forward and aft chassis parallel. they are."
"no. i'd say your - each - each step only goes about - when you're running normal, i'd say they'd go about 3 or 4 feet, but you could just go in- definitely at this pace."
"eagle and columbia, houston. roger. we copy."
"roger, jim. that's right. and noting on the altimeter, that means your delta-h is minus 128."
"otherwise, it would have been pretty boring. l0 o9 2o28 cor ... l0o9 21 32 c_ ... lo o9 21 39 cor ..."

isn't that good? nice and cold? time skip
"okay, houston; aquarius. i'd just like to do the little sun check. do you want me to do it now?"
"(laughter) i was wondering if you would own up to that. hey, the good doctor over here says that your traces are flat lines. thought you ought to be aware of that."
"jack , i thought you were going to get the sleep shift where there was'n lt any excitement?"
"put it there, dick."
"and, casper; houston. when you get down to do that p52 and go to scs, g&c suggests that perhaps you ought to - since you're that close to gimbal lock - that middle gimhal angle, you might go minimum dead band and uncage the bmags. and low rate on that, too."
hold the bag.
"okay, dick. you say you're working on the out-of- plane. you're very garbled."
and -
mode's in egress ....
okay. pressure reg b to cabin.
"roger. stop ptc mode for us now, please."
"okay, take that time - -"
what's the - oh - 55? okay. purge. that son of a bitch went - -
"i couldn't see. and dick was standing outside, because, hell, with all those ..., you know, you turn the camera on and off."
i don't know any way.

"okay. well, by putting it down in the hole, they were going to use it for heat flow hole."
"i can crawl up the ladder halfway if you'll get my upper. i can be going up the ladder, and you can knock it off."
okay. we'll do it in just a minute.
yes. *** some helmet bags in the src area. they are already there.
"al, that should be bistatie vhf."
okay. we'll get that down to you in just a minute.
"and, tranquility, i have a lm consumables update for you."
"wait, let me talk to him. okay, ed. do you want those pipa biases loaded now? 07 c3 30 42 cc that's affirm."
"yes, i wouldn't think they'd be able to make out detail like that."
apollo 13_ houston. you are go for t&d.
yes. (tranq)
let me get over here and get the gnomon and - a sample of this rock right here; this rock is very - typical of all the fragments around here.

"well, the - the rays extending from proclus are very light in color for about - they are very light color for about - oh, 240 to 260 degrees around, and then there's a region of dark mare or albedo. and our - our orientation presently with the spacecraft is such that we have - we're having a tough time figuring out north and south; and, once we get on an orbit track, we'll be able to give you dirgction a little bit better. but the inner walls of proclus are very light in color, almost white. the outer walls - the outer ring has a somewhat light gray appearance, and the difference in the - the rays is really between a light and a dark gray, as distinguished from the inner walls which are quite white. the - the walls exhibit some debris on the upper slopes, maybe the upper 30 percent. i can see, on one side of the - the crater, some large blocks. on another side, i can see what appears to be a large slump block or a large --_ slumping of the wall that goes about hal_,way down and takes about - oh, 15 degrees of the rim of the crater with it. the floor is very irregular and rough, almost constant gray - medium gray color, somewhat darker than the light gray on the outside rays and somewhat lighter than the dark gray on the - the surface, which does not seem to be covered with a ray pattern. there are a few ridges on the floor, arcuous ridges, and some domes which are quite prominent. and i'm sure when a1 comes back over here later on and has a chance to study it carefully, he can give you a - a good accurate picture."
"if i can get the - there, it's damping. the roll's 5 degrees, right."
"all angular, though, i'll tell you that. here's one with a white streak, looks like a caliche streak through it. leave it. that's all; it's a white rock."
"scs? yeah, go."
"okay, dick, 2 minutes to burn."
"yes, should have gone to middle cooling."
"ready, jim?"
"jim, that's affirm. that pad is still valid."
"okay, that's nine at 21-minute check, and we got 1 degree on roll, got 2 degrees on - 1-1/2 degrees pitch, and about 4 degrees yaw. fdai sk_,wc.t, 1/2, john."
"roger. we observe your maneuvering, and we'll have some uplinks for you in a couple of minutes here."
yes. mine is off.
it sure is.
"roger, dave. 05 05 53 55 i_mp-eva you want both lrv battery covers open, is that correct?"
"roger, jack. we'll take a look and let you know as soon as they look stable enough."
okay. the heading on the first leg is 162.
"a neat way to go scare up the fish, i guess. cml° (laughter) right."
you want to try one?
roger. the bias test is completed at _he end of a minute 40 seconds. we got 102.0 on our delta-v co_mter.

yeah. huh?
"well, yes, i guess that's what it'll be - it's going to be an rcs burn at about ll-foot per sec- ond. it'll drop the - it'll circularize the orbit, and then we'll do the plane change burn."
god damn it. we have los? at what time?

"pull the 2, huh?"
... h_er somewhere.
"okay. 09 20 55 10 cnp that's wh - one reason i've been wearing mine all the time is it's the only way i can get houston. the dse won't pick up the lightweight set hardly at all, unless you do what charlie is doing, other- wise you won't be ..."
"first thing we ought to do is go to work on the entry checklist, right? entry stowage list?"
... recognize that.
"eagle, houston. roger. 15.5."
"you know, i can't relax in this couch? just flat- ass can't do st, damm it. i'm always tense. 03 0h 51 07 cdr plus 32, yaw, 290."
up. up. up.
"is it in? okay. oops, that bag won't stay open. _p-eva yes. it will after we get a couple of samples in there. okay; my locator."
"and i'll - by that time, i hope to have the card 4 - -"
"jim, i think this little valve in your jiminy [?] bag is all clogged up. that's your problem. because i just tried that, and it works fine - transferred to a new jiminy [?] bag .... valve."
"we sure come off it, didn't we?"
dig in that stuff.
stand by. we're checking.
all right.
"okay. and, i'll give you one more, v-8, and that's the landing site. just like to make sure you try to get an opinion of questions i and 2 and the age relationship also on that question we asked earlier about aristillus and autolycus. and that's all i'll give you right now. nom. 06 06 00 bo cmp yes. okay, vance. i'm over the landing site now and that unit up along the western edge of the front there to the northeast of the landing site very definitely looks like a flow unit that's - that's flowed along or parallel to the base of the front."
"0mnz charlie, apollo 16."
go ahead.
"hey, 15, you still with us?"
"okay, 02 heater number 3 went to auto."
"(laughter) you know, it's really funny. we just ... - - 06 18 50 12 _ we're no-go for tei. - -"
oh. when is the undocking?
"there's nc,big one to go with it. a sharp one ts go with it. this is that one right up there. hsw about that? 05 12 31 h8 lmp yes. let's take a look."
"yes, that's what i'm talking about."
"intrepid, houston. that's negative. address 1454 should read 00406, and address 1456 should read 00777. over."
and i will pull the power amp circuit breaker.
what's the problem?
"i'm just going to copy the procedure, and we'll do it later."

"okay, cofy."
"falcon, houston. if you're not busy, i'll give you some switch positions to get set up for the vhf comm check."
okay. that sounds beautiful. that ought to be a good data point for something.
it's just because we haven't shaved in 2 weeks.
"we can look it up, jack, if you're interested. we - we'll have to check your records, they don't have it right in front of us."
"and we've checked all the fittings and i know i can hook everything up to our ucds. so, if it doesn't leak, we can transfer."
"and if somebody cleans our suits, they can get another 5 pounds."
"yes. oh, man. look -"
"right there, 340 ."
"oh, man."
"excuse me, pete, i'll move it over and plant it. 04 20 39 _6 cdr wait a minute."

okay.
"how's your ags looking now? 07 04 48 31 _ oh, looks l_ke 4 feet per second for - -"
"yes, it - subtle though - subdued."
"- - one is just a general comment, ron. as you can see, we're cutting into your eat period, and you're going to be awful busy, and your eat period is very short. so, right at wakeup, while you're working, you might be considering getting eat things ready to go up with - ready to eat. you know, just as you're doing you postsleep check and that, you might be getting some food out. you're going to be busier than the proverbial one-armed paperhanger there."
"direct 02 valve, open."
"hello, endeavour; this is houston."
good show.
he doesn't want to get p t.
"suit fan 2, open."
*** i'm confused.
(laughter) right.
i'd like to see us a little more level.
"okay, we want you to select normal voice."
okay. that's a good readback. that's all i have for you. lmp-i_ okay.
- - ...
and i think that probably goes for everybody. that probably goes for - it goes for ron and probably gene also.
roger; we understand.
yes. 0h 14 25 51 lmp 23 plus - -
"must be a pretty steep slope here. man, look at tho_e angular blocks there, would you. around there. tony, here are 30 or 40 very angular blocks - 50 centimeters or so - and they have the same ch_'acter as the ones we sample bagged, so - apparently, a ray material."
59:19.
"okay, the temp labels on the rtg package say ... release."
"and, ken, your biomed data looks good now and i guess that's about all i got for you at aos. did you see anything on this last back side that is worthy of comment?"
"what are these with, charlie? the stb?"
"yep. go ahead. 02 10 i2 28 cmp houston, apollo 16. over."
okay.
okay; let's go.
"oh, i don't know. 03 10,56 24 cmp:_' did you get yourself located?"
okay. you got 367. you want to pick up the camera just before i hit abort stage.
pardon?
"okay, of course, as you know, we're working the flight plan now, and hank's got the - the pads for you. and i just wanted to make one other eom_ent now. do you have any other questions - do you have ar_ reservations about this duty_ because we s'_re want _o get - get your concurrence? but every- thing looks like it's - it's go."
"get out of the way please, jack, and we'll take a look against some bright soil."
"triple crater. well, there's one crater right here - -"
hotdiggity.
you know what i've been marking?
that's affirmative. i just say it the long way.
"roger, al. we - we want to get a few minutes, about 5 minutes of sim bay data there at - it's 15:45 in your flight plan, and then we're - then we can go into ptc."
that's correct.
"very good. tape51/1 apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription ob 05 24 31 cdr houston, apollo 15. 03 05 24 b7 cc 15, go ahead."

you're on.
"okay, charlie."
roger; and it's your computer.
... i had ... after tpi. and everything worked out good.
"yeah, itts going like a champ."
this.
trim's set.
"and, jack. sometime at your convenience, i've got an update for the flight plan. it's pretty much your next rev. so sometime during this rev, give me a call, and i'll read it up to you. it'll be - it'll start just about the time the next rev starts."
roger.
"yes, i think it is. cml° yes, i can see it increasing."
okay. change that line to 00377.
okay.
we shculd have them again here in about 2 minutes.
got to do something for the ... - -
"hello, houston; 5 by."
"yes, this stuff is really tight. 03 09 07 h6 cdr yes."
- - something. so stand by.
"i'm getting the standard ones, bob."
"yes, everything's doing great, both in orbit and on the surface. everybody is very pleased."
okay. why don't we try that right now?
beautiful.
"well, i think it's just the outside. i looked at the lens; it looked clean."
"okay, houston, the cmp is coming up."
okay. will do.
okay.
"over in the margin, to the left of all that, make a comment: ""delete visual only."""
"that's how long it was, and about - oh, a fifth that thick or that wide."
...
you got it?
looks good.
okay. thank you.
"well, john, it was heck (laughter) for a while, but i think we made it."
"yes sir, baby. that is - that is a perfect shadowed soil sample."
"that's running about right. it must have been sitting right on the - i got some heater load on there. main b. those radiators couldn't be cycling, could they?"
"go ahead, pete."
"oh, the contents of bag number l, joe. - have we got - certainly not full. we have core stems in _nere?"
- - on the rock. the projections of the rock are perfectly clean.
"okay. i'm taking the lsm out, joe."
"here, i got - i got - let me get it piece by piece."
okay.
roger. stop to start. go.
"okay. 02250, plus 11250, plus 00250."
"bob, that 45 yankee was a fine-grained ..."
can't keep it open. there. okay.
"okay, there's the master alarm. heck, i can't get it."
"yeah. you could if there wasn't so much igneous soil on it. when i have it, we'll put it out there."
it could be.
okay. *** before pictures?
"okay. _p okay, gordy. you want to give me ._ oaa?"
right here.
32 enter. there you go.
"okay, bob, the big bag is on the inside of the - of the pallet."
"watch it, watch it, watch it."
"okay, ken, i can - as soon as we get around here, we better go dock, because we got 32 minutes to darkness, and i don't want to have another one of them night dockings."
okay. go 'ahead. i'll take a picture.
okay. got a -
"okay. we're in perfect position to take pictures of the lm right now. all we've got to do is to pitch. you'll prepare us to go to the other sequence, is that correct?"
it's all in one eye. that doesn't bother you?
"we - we - we - we delete the ""repeat 4-frame sequence."""
"ail right. i got - i got ahead, here."
"yes. actually slower or faster, either one, i guess. well s yes, slower. it's a very unusual thing to have that happen."
stay away from the cable.
it's all the way out.
it's open.
okay. ascent helium 2; okay.
"i'm picking you up fairly well, now. and before you guys get too far, a couple of comments we want to do on the way. if - there is a rover sampl_ stop in your checklist, it used to be at the 073 and 6.3; it's the first thing there, halfway out to hole-in-the-wall. and we're now going to have that rover sample stop at 078 and 7.0. that should be along your tracks going home. so, about 078 and 7.0, we'll have the rover sample stop. and the gravimeter people have won today, and we're going to stop and get off the rover and get a gravimeter reading at that location. we're taking out another stop, i'm not sure quite where. and right now, jack, you're right on on the film says a little note in front of me."
and you left the ground again.
"okay, ed we're on the lunar surface checklist, page 3-2. over."

"apollo 13, houston through guaymas. over."
"the west coast residents in seattle, washing- ton; portland, oregon; vancouver, british columbia; and san francisco all plan to make their areas visible to the three of you by lighting their lights between 9 pm and mid- night tonight, according to the asso_ia+=d press. we do have clear weather predicted there, so you may be able to see christmas lights, porch lights, store lights, and whatever may be turned on."

"houston, 17. how do you read?"
"okay, we understand."
yeah. can't you realign it later?
"that's correct. now, turn back to 55 plus 50, and there's a long series of deleted activities that will follow-. these - all because we're not going -- to do a midcourse 3, as you're well aware. and i'll call them out line by line, and they'll carry through for - i guess about a page and a half here. at 55:00."
"casper, you a go for sep."
"and, pete, now for your reference on the photos. your shadow length now is 18 foot."

"okay, that one was number 8. a quarter-pound charge, and i guess it was fourth - i'm not sure which location that was. it was 0.4 of a mile from the lcru, if that helps you decide."
"okay. i got verb 06, noun 20. give me a mark on it."
could be that you could ... this side.
"now, i tell you, i can't see to the bottom of it, and i'm just as close to the edge as i'm going to get. (laughter) that's the truth."
"hem, geno, how about slacking off for a minute there. you got pretty - going pretty _]ard. cdr-_'ja okay. one more turn and i'll get up. i've got to hit an easy spot sooner or later."

"11, houston. we copied two good marks. over."
stay tuned for the next installment on the earth. i'll try to get out of this suit.

"well, i guess we all probably have a different idea on which would be the single most exciting moment of the flight, and maybe we'll just run through it one at a time. i guess the most im- --_ pressive moment i can remember is standing up on hadley mountain, hadley delta, and looking back at the plain and seeing the lm and the rille and mount hadley, and the whole big picture in one - one swoop. and i think we've got same pictures for you from up there, and i believe the tv was running at the same time, and i think that was probably the most impressive sight that i've ever seen. al."
"i just used it to get a better grip with, not to pull the zipper, just to pull with."
would you like to have the tv beamed outside?

that'd be good.
"jack, what it looks like is that, when we hit 239 degrees at this attitude, it hit some sort of scan limit or something and drops off."
"okay. can you hold this? i ,"
"roger. in other words, you - you are able to stop talking or something when you - when you know we're breaking lock then?"
"no, i got those screws out just fine. and that thing that looks like it's going to - supposed to flop down - ought to flop down? that little - -"

"and, vance, we plan to start powering up at 78:12. is that a good time or do you think we ought to hold off a little longer?"
"roger, houston. what we plan to do for you today is start out in the space shipper [sic] odyssey, and take you on through from odyssey in through the tunnel into aquarius. and show you a little bit of the landing vehicle, and your tv operator is now resting on the center couch, looking at fred haise, whose head is now just about at the beginning of the tunnel, and his back is against the lower-equipment-bay optical area. and fred will now transport him- self into the tunnel, and into the spaceship aquarius. tap_, 36/_ ?_g_! 152"

"okay. i guess, ken, the first thing we'll talk about is the use of the emp in lunar orbit, that is when you're - when you're alone in the space- craft. we - we do not plan to run emp 509 con- tinuously, primarily because if you do, you don't have gimbal lock through gimbal lock protection. what we will do is we will run it during programs that involve tvc enable relay cycling, except for p52. now, that means that we will run it for sps burns, and you already have the procedures for loi and doi, and for other burns. the procedures will stay the same except that we may change the time sequences for doing some of the items. we will also run the emp 509 for p24 and for rendezvous_ and we're having mit verify that compatibility at the present time. we'll come back tc you on vh_s_ with more details later. and during p52 with the p20 option 5, our current procedures call for going cmc, free. instead of doing that, what we'll do is we'll go to this spacecra_ control, scs; put the rate switch high; and bmag mode, rate 2. and that way, the rate damping level is below your orb rate, and so your scs, as far as control is concerned, will be equivalent to cmc, free. how- ever, by going to scs control, if you want to check back on that list of set and reset conditions, you'll find that by going to scs control, we elimi- nate the possibility of getting this glitch. 02 23 56 43 cml° okay; would you say again how we're gonna handle p - nominally p20 option 5; we will not use 509. is that correct?"
let me get my water.
"okay. copy that, gene. thank you."
okay.
"okay. go ahead. they can't complain about that, certainly. i_{p-eva okay. now what?"
flip it over and hear the other side?
"that's it right there. that's got a metal plate. cy3 yes, that goes in the pga bag, i think."
"copy 15, pete. 05 12 17 oh cdr okay, and on my mark, i'm going to send a slightly smaller rock into the crater. are you ready? get set - ¥confidentiab"
"okay, ron. that pan camera - -"
"it's 122, charlie."
i got it. here we go. come on. you get that lioh canister and i'll get the camera.
steady ...
"say - say again, vance, on that last."
okay.
looking at a watch. okay.
"can't stand clear of it, because - should have left the treadle down there."
"okay, jim. if you w_lk back there, could you see - - . 05 02 53 41 lmp-eva i'll get the rake."
okay. we confirm that. please go forward - -
yes. it's 50 feet.
we don't - well -
"aquarius, houston."
"okay. sps thrust, direct on."
"okay, joe, i got the 500 pictures and - i took first - mount hadley; two horizontal strips up at _- the top where there are some outcrops, and probably the only two craters that i can see on the side of any sizable size. and then a vertical strip through one of the outcrops, and a vertical strip through __ another outcrop, and then two craters that are in - guess what we'd call - the forward leading edge of swarm mountain over there, which are quite prominent craters. and then i swung over to a bright fresh one that we see - oh, to the northwest, way out. and then i turned back around to hadley delta and shot upslope at hadley delta, and picked up the debris that seems to be exposed up on the top of hadley delta. and now the frames say 120."
negative.
"yeah, try it, charlie. 10 03 27 10 _ i think we were. the - the original impression had been mostly volcanics to look for, and i don't think we've found the - the highest percentage of vol - volcanics as we had originally anticipated. so the rocks that we found were unique, that we'd never seen before in any of the lunar samples, we feel, and so it was a surprise."
okay. i've got to clean the old suit circuit return screen yet.
"boy, is this dirt softl man! 05 00 31 15 _mp-eva like soft powdered snow."
"well, i guess behind is kind of relative. pa2 7e6"

okay. good deal.
3kay_ very good.
"america, 17. say again. 17, houston. cml° go ahead."
"i'll count down to zero and, say, plus ii then ycu shut it off, then; okay? 03 04 49 57 cn_ don't have to worry about this."
"you mean you didn't dust the lens, charlie?"
all right. you got it.
"looks good. need a little bit more this way, i think. the problem with tamping_ pete, it looks like every time you tamp, as your foot comes up - you know it - -"
"man, i never saw that big hole back there."
okay. '?ape 54/7

"okay, now there are a couple of other small - small craters around tsiolkovsky. particularly, one on the north side, on the northeast corner, the first large crater that you see there, has a very dis- tinctive lava flow or some kind of flow down - down in the crater. and that flow also originates up in the corner or up in the - in the high towards the rim of that particular crater, where there's some contact between the - the tsiolkovsky rim and the rim of that small crater."
sorry.
"apollo 16, houston. like to get a check on the battery compartment."

"reading you 5 by 5, charlie."
"yes. yes, it's right up in front of you there, dave."
"okay, john. you go to b, and i go to a."
"okay, gene. that's a pretty big rock in there."
we're saving all the water we can.
"okay, now. there we go."
i'm going to get it right now.
"okay, all i got to do is get in, soon as we dust off."
"hey, jim, you can probably tell me if i've got any rear steering."
... the tv?
"that's right. there. okay. yeah, i'll put the rock - you take the camera off - i'll put the rock in the - in this scb over here."
"the earth just fills up window 5. okay, f infinity, about a 250th."
"o, ,"

"okay. jack, we gave them our quantities already; so, squelch, vhf b lmp, full decrease."
okay.
"roger. at your convenience, we'll take po0 and accept and send you up a state vector, and - we need accept, and we'll send you up a state vector and clock update. and, i've got a tei-45 pad, at your convenience."
- - ... we're going up 3 degrees.
"ahh! ugh! ugh! ugh! come out, foot. there we go. got it. okay. wait a minute, and i'll give you the rover readings when i dust things off."
"fix it inside first; probably be better, guys."
roger. and the time is 177:20:33.
"boy, that challenger looks pretty from here, you know it."
"huh? yes. after - after awhile it gets to be work- ing, moving your legs around again, you know?"
"okay, that's fine. we understand."
"roger; understand. okay, dps throttle check. what you got to do, charlie - you are all wet. here, get the thing back away from you."
"okay, it's orbital science photos coming up here. do you want to use magazine ex still? or should we finish up oscar oscar?"
"apollo 11, this is houston. over."
huh?
"for a minute there i was worried. okay. i can stab it into the ground about - okay, are you guys ready? here we go."
"well, we don't have anything else, do we?"
is it in the activation checklist or is it in the flight plan?
no.
"okay. as we're cooling down, the flow patterns tend to join together, so far. the ones on the outer periphery dissolve into straight lines. straight lines are emanating in a radial direction from the center of the circle. o1 22 24 12 _ and, houston, if you're listening; or dse if you're listening. had a little bit of film - oop_ there's the end of film right now. may as well stop it. hey, i went to high for a little ways."
six and a half.
"i would guess, you know, that the angle of looking at it - other factors have changed sc much vhat it would be pretty hard to pull them together once you - even though you get the images reduced to the same size, but it might be interesting _o try."
303 - 4303. okay.
i don't think ...
you're right. hey -
"copy that. and did i understand 4.2 on the range, gene?"
"okay, dave. if you'll hold - - - 05 03 08 06 cdr-eva okay."
thank you. gene's doing a great job.
"okay, and i gather it was still barber pole, right?"
"okay. in any of the craters that you looked into, was there any evidence of outcrops in the walls? anything other - you mentioned the one boulder that was sticking out the side of flag, i think it was, that - was there any other evidence of any - any bedrock? any ledges?"
want me to put a bag in front of it in case it pops open again? i guess it won't.
"w_at? cinco? yeah, this is it. here's the one, there's one, and the big one is just to the left over there with the v in it."
"you in your maneuver, ron? cml° yes. it's maneuvering now. cdr-r_m okay, i'm going to go out and take a peek at your sim bay up here. yes, i know. cdr-l_,i see him okay_ jack? see him okay?"

copy that.
maybe a little to the right.
what's the problem?

"and we'll be leaving it on battery a all night long. okay, that's all the flight plan changes. i've got that flyby pad when you're ready."
"water flag, a."
"man, that's really good and stuck!"
"okay. copy that, jack."
"... 07 22 22 46 cml° - - couple of those little pills, and iill be all set. thank you, sir."
roger. that's fine. that's what we expect.
"okay, tony. starting our pan from about the i o'clock position of the rover, sort of bracketing these blocks - blocks here."
okay. now we can squirt a little more 02 flow in.
okay?
okay.
"roger. thank you. 05 21 00 04 cdr-i_ houston, bow's the biomed look?"

"okay, that sounds like a good idea."

it's a football-size fragmental rock. let me - mhy don't you just stuff it. see if you can stuff it in there with that - with the bag down - -
it's clean. honest.
"yes. and the tone came on, so i'm ready to have the oxygen off. i've got a good tight suit. 04 19 04 59 lm2° okay .... - -"

"thank you, joe. we're ready, too, but it's been great. fabulous place up here."
yes. they both fell off when that thing opened.
okay. we'll do that.
yeah.
"i'm about as iow as you can go, joe. i'm sitting on 4.4."
"just think, that hook - or something changes the ge_netry."
okay. there we go.
okay. then you change to 24 fra_s per second.
"hand controllers, armed."
"and, jim - -"
roger. we were afraid you'd get use to the luxury of all that space.
and - yes. 561. that's a - a sample of the gray - looks like recrystallized breccia that the dikes are continuous with. and - -
roger. we copy that.
they won't find the other one. stand by.

go ahead.
"okay, you ready for mapping camera and pan camera operations ?"
tsiolkovsky is ... the terminis.

"that's the one i'm talking about. see, i just broke that open."
i'm talking to me.
okay. we'll do that and go to omni delta.

i'm watching it.
"i think that if we're on hot mike when we're talking to each other, i want to apologize right now. it's probably pretty interesting. probably not, if the comm was as bad as you said it was."
"okay, there we go."
how's that? cdr-!_ we'll find out tn a minute.
hope you didn't drink any of the coffee while we were gone. sure is going to taste good.
that has to be done from your couch there.
"pretty good, ron. pretty good. and as you start your morning's activities, you can be aware that we were watching the spacecraft through the night, and as flight puts it, everything is swinging. 06 08 02 21 cml° outstanding. that's what we like."
that's affirmative.
"well, that's okay. i stopped and wondered about it, and then i decided i couldn't think of any reason why it wouldn't work the way we did it. okay, we're back in sync now. now we can start with 509. is that affirmative?"
roger.
"ll, this is houston. go ahead. over."
roger. we may have a problem there because it looks like low to us on the data. we'll check further.
okay. and i'll get the camera and - -
yeah.
"03, that's affirm."
"roger, jack. transfer to lm power. thank you. 02 06 46 47 _ and the docking-tunnel index, jack, was minus 2 degrees."

"apollo ll, this is houston. how do you read?"
"300 and lunar, we got set on it."
i - i still don't think that that's our decision- making process up there on the surface.
"yes, i am. holy smoley. (laughter) turn - turn to the left. *** off. let me fill it."

"i'm filthy, huh?"
"okay, it says, ""rate gyro test."" suit circuit - well, wait a minute."

okay.
"one-scoop-schmitt, they call me."
"31.0, 0.11."

and then let's get out of here. 05 14 41 04 l_ okay. want to get a docu - we document and a couple of the big pieces. how's that?
go ahead.
okay. i'll - i'm just about to the point where i'll take my comm carrier off so i'll be off comm here for about 10 minutes. what's los time?
"okay, it looks like i may need a little more to the south. __v -.4 __ _ ·, [,"
but you can see a lot better over here when you take your shades off.
"okay. at 230:20, 230:20, add the following: ""laser alti_er, off; la, off."" l_ just keeping pressing on, bob. i'll get them and let you know if i get them all."
starting the clock.
"that's okay, ken."
"okay. delta-vx, plus 77.6; delta-vy, plus 3.8; delta-v z, plus 3.1; for a total of 77.7. tpf is 29. over."
"i'll come around from this end and go around to that side. lnp-eva okay, i'll go perpendicular to you more or less. lmp-eya boy, that one right behind you is just vesicular, by comparison, to a high degree - like three times as much."

okay.
okay.
"no, sir. thank you. okay. bob, - -"

"roger. same on 16, fred."
"yes, that's affirmative. it's right-side up, if you're looking at the connect panel, you know?"
roger.

"oh shoot, it really gets bumpy."
"yes, see the clast in it."
"so much dust - on the camera, it's hard to read the settings."
i was looking for the flight plan and stuff. and the little books.
better make sure it's lunar ... %
okay.
"yeah. what's the dac should be - i mean, there's hasselblad/dc/60/hex-a, (f/ll, 250, focus)."
righto.
sm/ac power; off. down on 181.
don't let anything to chance.

...
"okay, joe. we're all listening. go ahead."
okay. what's the range and bearing one more time?
"go ahead and take your time. and when you get all squared away, give us about 5 minutes or so, and we'll be all set."
"okay. so the first thing will be to - ""go to auto on the rcs system a and b""? oh 04 15 50 cc it's the ""verify that the heaters have been in alpo for 15 minutes."" back on the first page of this procedure, you put the heaters in auto and you pushed the breakers in, and we'd like for them to warm up the quads for 15 minutes before we start to - stop at - stopping ptc. over."
"roger. copy, al."
"rhc power, nop_al, two, ac."
"okay; right exactly there. okay; i think that'll do it. now your hammer. if we can't get - oh, let me take a couple of after pictures before - -"
"okay, tony. the 500 is complete. what do you want me to do now?"
"yes. okay. yes_ that's the one teat the c_wera pushes open by itself. cdr-e_ okay° well, that's good. i can't see anything that's abnormal do_n there. everything's covered; e_-erything's flushed."
"all right. john, this is very much like the simu- lator where, because of the dead band lags, it looks like it takes a long time to pick up one of those rates."
"yeah. hey, houston, are we on mike to you now?"
should heve put the gnomon up. well -

understand.

okay. i guess everybody is in agreement. go ahead and high gain should stay on during this maneuver.
is it?
looks to me like you may be able to head just like you' re going.
there are a bunch of little specks or spots all over the outside of it. it looks like dust that's collected there. window 5 is almost clear.

"well, you can't believe it, tony, but that beauty is coming out."
say again?
"and another thing you might be thinking about if you get an opportunity on some round is to get us a description of the area north of crater king, including the soviet mountains."

yes.
"yes, my rate needles are bouncing back and forth a half a degree (laughter)."
"okay. you're coming through loud and clear now, 11, with your patch."

do we have an 02 and h2 purge or just 02?
"and the mains are out, three."
stereostrip. we have orb rate -
"thank you, sir."
"okay. let's try to see if i can read in this sun now. rotate the hand controller. let's wipe it out a couple of times to make sure we got all the the steering. she's wiped out. she goes forward and she goes reverse. she's back in forward; she's wiped out, and she's in park. reverse is down. okay, here we go. stand by for life. it ought to be on this one. there's life in this here baby. beautiful. i_4p-eva i don't know who's responsible for packing this etb, but i think it was me. you didn't by any chance pick up those scissors, did you?"

we got any bags left?
"okay. you have any feel for how high the rock is or how low - how deep the thing was with respect to the - with respect to the rtg? where you down in a level that was below, even without the rocks being there?"
okay; we'll get it in a few minutes.
make sure that's in there. i'm trimming the residuals.
"yes, i think_we should."
there is a flurry of activity in the pa0 s_ for the evening news.

"okay, jim. ¥_at - what do you mean, a go for c!oseout, then? you want me to wait until the water boiler dries out before i do anything else?"
okay; yeah.

"go ahead, joe."
the tape is in motion; big brother is listening.
"houston, apollo 11. you want to look at these noun 93's before i proceed on?"
ail right. no trim and 1 second.
"jack, you'll be glad to know your heart is beating normally. we have a good signal."
ckay ....
"well, i don't know. the last one was so good, i might as well do this one, too."
did you get that mark?
"okay, the rake sample should be one crater diameter away from plum. and it doesn't have to be -"
okay.
"i'm afraid you're right. and here comes the sun. man, are you bright."
"al, you've got to change those logic powers, too, and go back an off; i'm sorry. i was thinking we had to retract the bocms. they're already retracted."
"15, houston. watch your middle gimbal."
"joe, this is aquarius; wonder if you can give me the get time of initial powerup?"
"okay, bob."
okay. and you're go for the shorting switch when you get there.
the velcro - -
okay.
"yes, sir."
"okay. if it's between 2 and 5 at doi plus 30 and rr confirms that pgns no-go, do it no-pdi plus 12. forget it. you're going to have to copy these residuals down. both of us do."

roger. copy.
"you have? okay. that's a beautiful sight. all right, i'm going to go down and turn the dump on, and if it looks like it's going to obscure our vision, then i'll - holler and i'll turn it off right away."

we have sausage and eggs. how about sausage this morning.
"man, that's a mighty impressive territory down there; i'll tell you that."
"okay. as promised to spencer, the mags are as follows. first, the 16-millimeter stuff; mag a's been used 100 percent; mag b's been used 100 per- cent; c and d haven't been used; e's been used about 4 percent; f is still full; g is full; h has been used 25 percent; i is full; j, k, and l are full. okay, on the hasselblad, i'll call out the number of frames used. okay. mag m, metro 100 - 1, 5, 3 are the frames used; and nectar is 42; 0 is 39; and p and q are 0; r is 20, and f is 40. and no 35-millimeter film has been used."
"okay. that's good to hear. and, i see that our old sps oxidizer pressure has dropped some more. i guess the old - the helium is working it's way in there - or out of there."
"america, houston."
you never know.
did you want the flight plan or the update book?
"okay, we got the picvure; tell us where to look."
"in other words, you want to tape it and leave it erect."

okay.
"okay; you might remember we're looking for the colored tones, the shades between units up on crisium, and we're looking for location of color boundaries relative to the mare ridge system."

"apollo 16, the questions in this press conference have been prepared by newsmen covering the flight here at the manned spacecraft center. i'm going to read them to you exactly as worded by the news- men and in a priority specified by them. question number i for john young: a couple of times you were on hot mike and didn't know it, but how could a nice florida boy like you say what you did about citrus fruit?"
yes. bag 501.
()kay.
okay; i'll cycle the cryo fans.
"(h_mming) you know, i think another good day's work."
"okay, the ags are set, 410 - standing by. man, that was a sup!"
"roger. copy .o1, plus .07, minus .47, minus .05, and 202:00:30."
"can you get the tape out for me, john? i can't get this thing to stay in down here. _ ,-,it, i i"
"just to the north of this - the large one. i just mentioned, there're two other large fragments. and there's a fracture right between them, and they also have the large vesicle pattern."
"that came through loud and clear, al."
"o_ay. just a little pressure. 06 04 03 03 ia{p-eva beautiful. you picked some up on that one. only on one corner. he got some on one corner, houston."
it looked that way.
"*** focus. yes, this - there you go."
we want to go southeast.
09:11 is shutdown? huh?
go ahead.
it's not in. you're going to have to do that; i can't see it.
"16, go omni delta."
"and, falcon, give us po0 and data, and we'll give you an up-link."
"houston, 15. go."
"okay. roger. stand by. 05 20 _1 b4 cc okay. press on, fred. 05 '20 '12 '39 i,mp okay."
"roger, dave; we copy that."
roger. and we've got an observation you can make if you have some time up there. there's been some lunar transient e_ents reported in the vi- cinity of aristarchus. over.
"well, okay."
"that a boy, davy."
"roger, apollo 15; go ahead."
okay. how's the tv working?
okay. one thing that we did miss in the dropout in the noise here is your lm/cm delta-? reading for about 28 hours gzt. over. 01 0_ 37 05 i_p okay. the lm/cm delta-p is 0.98.
"oka_._,senor."
"pete, we're busy with this entry stowage. could you keep us on the flight plan if something comes up?"
"okay. i suggest that you take the other bag that's on the gate there, and put that on either you or jack. and also, the commander's bag is pretty full also, we suspect."
"gee, i'll tell you where the tv mount is."
i got them now.
"roger. we got about an hour sitting around here. we can go to wide dead band, if you want, if you'll remind me to go back to narrow again when we need to."
"okay, john. we got 4 hours and 15 minutes or so."
"okay, we understand it's just a completely dif- ferent situation, charlie."
"okay. now, that - that complete procedure for getting into it, as far as getting into it's concerned. what i will give you now is how to back out of it after you're through with your readings. are you ready to copy?"
"okay. go ahead. i'm ready, joe."
itrb 62 now. pag6e0 t confiden l 'ay:
oops.
okay.
"three, 4, and 5 - 5-second hold. then we're gonna make sure we got the circuit breakers in. all ..."
what about some of these little fragments that seem to be sitting more on the surface?
yes.
"okay; we'd like it simultaneously. 01 00 5h 52 cmp okay; pan camera to self test, getting self test."
... correct ...
"they're both looking - stand by, i thought he said both fine. ron's doing great, too. he's sitting here busily - -"
"okay, joe. we'll park it at 283. reading about 284 now. bearing, distance, and range, of course, are zero; amps are 100, 108, 68, 78, and motor temps: forward and rear are off-scale low."
"okay. 0_ 16 20 _8 lmp-lm gordy, i think maybe the predictions of a fairly thin regolith were good. i have a crater at about - oh, 130 feet. it looks like it's not more than a meter deep. it's very fresh, has a bright halo around it, and it's very rocky in its interior and has some rocks that are at least l0 or 20 cen- timeters in diameter on the rim. it looks like it's penetrated into some rockier - much rockier substrate than what we're seeing on the surface. the surface itself looks like a - oh, probably 15 percent fragments greater than half a centimeter."
"okay. in your summ_y there, you answered a whole mess of my questions here. i got to slide down the list and find one you haven't answered. okay. how about that albedo change in the subsurface soil that you talwed about? it s_d like, course you saw it first time at flag and more - probably more excited about it there. was there any dif- ference in that- in - in its nature between there and buster and bt.gep mud i1_? _x"
"okay, 4 minutes. challenger's go. ye're through 37k."
okay.
"we missed the one that was supposed to start 3 hours ago, or whenever it was."
okay. (tranq)
"roger. you're about 30 seconds from it. why don't you go ahead and do that, ken?"
yeah. we should have ...
"ron, go receive only. imp okay. attitude - you got ags?"
i don't ...
"soft stop. and you're - you're clipping a little bit on the first part, jim."
"okay. if you'll dig sut your entry eh_cklist there on page e6-1, i'll update your pdtro times there for the various altitudes. over."
"dave, there are pros and cons to that. we could do it if we finessed it just right. but since it's difficult, and we have to stop rolling anyhow, it's better to stop the roll this time."
right. understand. just like fs smooth.
"roger, pete. stand by."
don helmets with levas.
"roger, pete. on this sun angle, or sun azimuth - as far as we can see, there'll be no noticeable difference as far as you're concerned. ail you got to do is watch out and not fly through any clouds. 0_ 1_ 05 12 cdr okay. i'll stay away from the clouds, and we're looking for the snowman."
"casper, we done passed your 39. it's 40 now."
and no flags and no tone; and_i'm on - i'm on intermediate coolant and i feel great.
roger.
... - -
"the limb is, of course, still growing and a little more rapidly. and what i can see of the - of the limb that's not blocked out by the sun, it's getting obviously much larger in the window."
enter.
why don't you get the platform ... there we go.
"you can go ahead and torque, ron."
"ken, your cabin's up to 5.8. we suggest a vent."
"yeah. you're zapping the - the sim bay, too, with the thrusters. john, i can't see my - okay, there we go. looks good."
"how do you read that down there now, houston?"
"okay, we'd like to try to get the bulk of this flight plan update up tonight because we won't have the 210-foot dish until 2 hours before lift- off. how you doing up there?"
"okay, ron. we're ready with some more if you are."
i don't have a thing to do - it's clean.
"okay, our range - the range estimate must have been off for elbow. our map says 2.7, joe said 3.2, i guess. you confirm that, joe?"
"al, the way people talk down here, they're going to give you a medal for good sightings up - up there. they say that the - the gamma from this last series of sightings was 6.55, whereas the value we have down here is 6.50."
i was going to reach for the g&c dictionary (laughter ).
"where did you say that was located, jack? 02 08 18 0b cc that's in your systems checklist, page 1-5."
did you get another one?
"here, let me - let me - show you the map, again."
"those ridges in places look like they could be nothing more than a - than a - than a flow that stopped there - flow front. in other places, they look like - like a - like it's buckled material underneath, folded to - to give it some elevation."
... 08 20 09 15 i_p is it up all the way? yes - you - you have to push pretty hard to get it on there.
- - i didn't think about it.
"and, 15, we're getting you on high gain and receiving -"
"now, you want 211, right?"
... yes. yes. it's already charging.
"hey, a1 - stand - al, stand by. stand by."
you lucked out.
"0h, boy."
"see where those craters are right there, dick? the taller ones?"
"okay. you should be able to see,on the right side of your picture when i settle dcwn here. you should be able to - *** ico nfident,- ttlm"
"houston, apollo ll."
"i guess i'm sorry that - i'm sorry that we had that accident with that cable but i - we - we prob- ably should improve our training along those lines, but i don't know what else to do."
"all right. i don't know - well, from where the - about 50 meters from where i guess we'd say we see real outcrop."
okay.
"... out in daylight .... burned quite a ways in the darkness, didn't we?"
okay. and you plss 02 off at cabin greater 2.5. it's there now. and you're probably getting talked to.
"okay, here it comes."
"here's the torquing angles, david."
"they also - cut in for about a half minute or so and showed a view of the crowd in just the avail- able light from the booster, and it stood out pretty well."
hight in front of my seat. that little black thing.
"- - ... got back to the lm. and i guess the question would be, did you ever go through zero on the way back to the imm? if you are at o. - if you were at 0.2, and we think 9 - 092 was the bearing, then the lm is right where we thought it was, and we were just a little confused by our distances. just doesn't quite - they don't quite hold together."
my watch is reset.
"no, i think it's going to be easier this way. r cdr-eva okay, try it. i don't think they're going to be much problem the way they are, _yway."
"roger, mike. and our pitch attitude's a little wrong here. if you're ready to copy, i'll give you the sep pad. over."
_md i have the rest of these flight plan ch_n_es for you. just give me a - a call when you're ready to take them.
"we see that. looks like a good job. 04 12 45 36 i_p-i_m yes, but it's not an easy one, gordo. lmp-im go ahead."
"john, let's put this other piece in a - another bag, because this one has got no dust in it at all. hold - just hold that gnomon, let me ... this one up."
okay.
how are you doing this morning?
"i'll be right there, buddy."
okay. just a second.
we just passed south of alaska.
i hope it does.
"endeavour, this is houston. we copy the gamma ray, gainstep, shield, on. and al, we have a photo pad to you when you're ready to copy. over."
"jack, it is very comfortable. we've run it several times now and, in fact, it's being run right now, again. and we've run it both here at houston and at the cape. the only place where you might find that you need to stay ahead of tam: 85/_9 i'a_?.. 659 things is during the platform-alinement period, when you're getting ready to close out the lm and then once you get into the command module and jettison the lm, why you're back on a very com- fortable time. and, of course, we'll be watching and anything we can do, like keeping track of time for you, we'll remind you of that as we go along."
yes. i got it all dusted and the mag's changed.
"- - ... the rev 1. the thing is, that was - okay. the first one up is going to be mosting a. and, let me see, i should be getting my camera config- ured. well, i have plenty of time to do that. 03 12 05 47 i_ what would the 180 time be, stu, on this rev?"
- - and we'll get your ops ...
"okay, i - do you want to do this reference com- parison - scs attitude reference comparison cheek, john?"
"okay. i've got ""read plss 02 quantity to houston""; the next one is a note, ""if coremis no go."" is that the one you want?"
"and we did ..., gordy."
"closed and locked, babe. 07 00 05 46 lmp-i_ okay. okay, dump valves both to auto. 07 00 05 5_ cdr-i_ they are."
"(laughter) i bet he would be. hey, that's a great find, by gosh!"
i hate to mess up 52. let's see - let me - let me get myself good and light adapted.
right here. 00 00 29 55 imp okay. the lexan shade is on.
"look at that, charlie!"
"okay, that's ..."
okay.
"okay. geno, we sampled some of the light colored group - as a matter of fact, this block looks different."
"and charlie, could you look at the amps during the higher speed part. we'd like a number."
"roger. when ships of the line have completed a mission such as yours and they return to home port, they always have a broom flying from the yardarm. over."
"not going to have any .., dowr, - -"
it's getting bigger.
roger.
"give me the hammer, char!ie."
- - at the tank systems.
"... 06:15 .... shows we're there. uncaged the old bmags .... now 50:18. okay. try the gimbal test option. plus 2, minus 2, 0. plus 2, minus 2, 0. 1, 2, 3, 4-"
that's pretty close to nominal.
that's a 40-meter crater.
miss the lettuce. sure have missed the lettuce and mayonnaise on mine though.
"on the bottom of the rock, joe, it seems to be gray where there's no surface alteration, but there is a surface covering. and in one portion, there's some glass and _lmost looks like slickenside across the glass, and it's about - 4 inches by 4 inches. and then there's - oh my, one whole corner of that thing that's loaded with glass. that's just an unreal rock - -"
okay.
"okay, gene_ ii'you're still there, i don't like to argue with you but i thir_ our analysis chart is a little more up to date."
we are on our way. want to get a clock countdown there?
another scoopful.
there's an after and now i'm going to get - sort of a closeup stereo around it. that ought to do it.
"that's right, geno. and we think you fellows have earned a good meal now, and maybe you can take the rest of the day off."
who is playing tomorrow night?
okay. you ready to switch to high gain now?
"no, it pulls me right cm down with it."
"hold on a second, and i'll copy those. but there's a flight plan change in just a few minutes i'd like to get to you. the mapping camera image motion, which is scheduled at 120:10, we'd like to have at 120:16."
"okay, i think i'll maneuver at attitude then."
"there, you got it?"
"well, if it's doing any good at all, let's just leave it on. it doesn't seem to be in the picture."
anti delete the last two steps.
"... , jim? 07 03 48 14 ia_p-lm ..."
yes. i heard about that. that was right before ___ the flight.
okay. mighty fine.
take - your feet.
"scb-4 will go on jack. jack, i got to get these *** straps, too. did you get mine? *** harness release straps?"
"yes, sir; we always are."
they're coming down.
that's affirmative. it shouldn't affect the other batteries. 08 23 13 _5 cmp okay. thank you. we'll try it for 1 again.
okay. and how - how does - how did those rocks compare to what you saw at station 5 - 5 and 6?
roger.
"intrepid, houston. we're feeling great."
here comes pyro a -
peanuts. let's really get the big stuff.
okay. it's going all right.
"well, take your old thing and do an exploratory there for a while. let's suggest that."
"apollo 13, houston."
it looks like the base of stone mountain is really topographically lower than we are right now. j
hang on.
"four minutes, 184, 36,000; within 300 feet, cameras off. i'm gonna let it run out. no, i better not. i've got to get some of ken. i forgot about that. okay. at 04:30, looking for 282."
"yeah. 05 20 26 56 lmp-_ no, what? ... what?"
so far as i know.
"dick, i hold you at 351 feet a second at 200 miles. 05 22 26 30 l_ okay, pete. there's going to be a noise. i'm go - 05 22 26 32 c_ i concur on that, pete. 05 22 26 3h cdr say - say again, dick."
it's coming right now.
thank you.
"17, houston."
"okay. you ready, you guys?"
"okay. we'd like bio_d, off now, jack. 0t 17 55 49 lmp roger. going biomed, off. okay, houston. how do you read the lm? downvoice backup; biomed, off; pcm, hi. over."
"boy, we'd use a lot of gas: 20,000 pounds' worth of fuel ..."
"no, it made it go the other way down towards - the - the legs of the lm."
go ahead.
okay. what do you want me to do?
"roger, bob."
"if you hit it - if you hit it on the right side, it'll go this way, maybe. there you go. good man."
maybe - maybe i hit the stick or something. yes.
no. i just started to set it up now when you got - -
"i guess the main thing we have to talk about is the inspection of the v over h sensor of the pan camera. are you ready to listen, al?"
"man, that's it."
"okay, now let me get that footpad. that's a beautiful shot there. we're going to do footpad 3, i guess it is, or is that 17"
"i am. logic po_r, two, off. sm/ac power coming on. fuel cell reactant valves to normal."
okay.
"just as good as ever. i added on the consumables. no problem on the spacecraft systems. only minor fannies in the sim bay, but even it is almost 100 percent."
we copy.
"well, don't forget ... new man on today."
"okay, ron. we're still riding you - reading you loud -"
okay. stand by. (t_q)
you see if they're like pele's - -
"apollo 11, this is houston. aver."
"no, they're just small."
"tranquility, houston. roger."
"roger, and i thank you."
"amazing machine, isn't it? 04 0© 35 43 cc that's pretty neat."
do we look that scroungy? (laughter)
"and, 15, we verify the pan camera lens is stowed. when convenient, we 'd like battery b charge - battery bravo charge terminated."
"tony, that's - that is a double muley - that rock."
"jim, all the gear's in bag 2. and as you pull it apart, we want you to put the fill stems back into bag 2, please."
"yes, do that, will you? sorry you missed that other one."
"jim, i guess you're going to be busy with the - -"
"maneuver to get it all in minus-x, and then do it."
roger.
"okay, in the middle of that section that we moved, it says ""acquire stdn,"" says ""high gain angles,"" and those will again be changed to minus 5 and 315 which is the same change we made on the earlier page."
okay.
"yes, ..."
roger. and this activates your upfiring jets.
okay. one minute. 04 l0 b9 06 lmp-lm okay. you hack the time?
0k_z.
"that's correct, and you don't have tho othor o_i,, because we never said it. we've gol {% hcr{_ ready to go. c_ oh, okay."
"on tl-50. and, at the right-hand side - if you're looking at the thing from the bottom, the right- hand side is 0 - go up 60 degrees. you're 60 degrees up from the horizontal and 30 degrees down from the vertical. it'll be something about like that."
mark.
"good; okay. don't - don't go below 2.7 delta-p there,"
"okay. and, john, verify that the dac is turned so the battery's towards the sun."
"yes. that's just - just what i saw. when i saw where we were, all i saw was 1, 2, 3, 4, that one over there and that snowman, and i didn't see another freaking thing. sure did. it looked just like it - you know, i looked up there and saw all these goddamn things and said, ""shit, where am i?"" and then all of a sudden - _qnmmo! it just - it leaped out like a neon sign."
that's nice to hear.
"okay. if no decrease in secondary accumulator quantity, secondary glycol to radiator valve to normal. next step, secondary coolant loop pump, (goss net 1) tape 38/3 ac-1 or ac-2. after 3 minutes, verify glycol discharge secondary pressure 39 to 51 psig. also verify secondary evap out temp has changed. next step, secondary coolant loop pump, off. secondary glycol to radiator valve, bypass. that ends the procedure. over."
... deadband - no.
- - a model of an underlying - -
"okay, read you now."
"copy, minus 69.1, minus 6.1, and plus 16.1."
you going to give me a mark?
everybody's nodding their head down here - affirmative.
copy that.
so were we.
"are you coming back around? 06 19 18 32 [b5°-_ no. don't think i will, not right now. 06 19 18 34 cdr-ijm yes. why don't you wait until we get this down a little bit. cabin is still 1.0."
roger. sure willo
we don't go all the way through.
"apollo 11, houston. over."
... suit pressure reading?
"okay, two more tubes on that tv camera and that baby's ours."
"houston, aquarius."
"casper, dac on. 07 05 07 46 _ houston, how do you read casper?"
okay.
"go ahead, hank."
"i thinl_ that'll hold it. 0_ 21 39 20 lm]: you're snap,pea over here. everything's secured. you have your 5-minute checklist. the - -"
"okay, i'll set them at a yaw of 45."
"hey, coming down?"
have you got yours?
- - southwestern rim.
"hey, wait a minute, ken - - 04 0b 50 19 cdr _oa, ken. you got it. 04 04 50 26 _p okay, ken. you were drifting south. that's right. you have to thrust north. you got it."
... from what?
left eye; dead center; intensity 2; point source. only ones i can see are the ones that hit me right between the eyes like a ...
"al, al, this is houston. do you read? over."
okay. we're parked right on the rim of it. we'll let you see.
"okay. thank you very much, fred."
"go ahead, casper. 0h 13 48 29 cnp houston, casper."
"okay, we're burning."
"#*# from the looks of that soil out there, that drill may have a job ahead of it."
"okay. retrieve purge valve, verify closed, and lock pin in, and lo. delta purge valve in red. 05 21 52 h6 cdr-lm okay. 05 21 55 07 lmp-l_4 okay. purge valve is in, and marked, and locked. 05 21 55 13 cdr-i_ okay, diverter valve's on vertical."
"okay, there you go."
"okay. we're getting set up for another gimbal drive check, ken, and what we want to do is go through a complete gimbal drive check by the num- bers, and have you tell us as you do each thing sa_despecially in relation to the - the yaw thumb- wheel, which way you're moving it and how many degrees and - and what's happening. and we '11 give you the word when we're ready to start that. we've got to get some things configured down here."
what's electrical?
"man, you come up like thunder. wowee!"
i think he said 094/5.1.
"yes, sir; 30 minutes to pdi. well, shoot."
"- - the 500-millimeter camera, we want you to take those pictures from here, and jim can be changing out his magazine while you take the big camera pictures."
you're writing noun 69 or something down?
sure miss having two cameras. 06 21 43 30 i2_p-eva yes. slow us down.
okay. primary is going to off.
"roger. out. and we need to point the tv ca,.era out to the alsep site. 04 19 40 56 _qp al, i'll go get it."
"plus 95 in yaw. trim is good in both directions in yaw. let me try a little mtvc. pitch is good. yaw is good. .... i- _-_.j _""_! '.__ b"
ail right. now you're talking my language.
"okay, we're coming up on 59:40."
wow! look at that landing. you almost got a big rock with the - about a 50-centimeter rock with the right leg - the left leg. that was a slight miscalculation on the ecb.
i guess that's going to be about 70 percent covered on the inside of the rim with these things.
yes.
"say again, john?"
"roger. just need a sharper pencil, jack."
"go ahead with the rest of the pad, bob."
"okay, 1/15th."
"yes. 04 13 38 19 _ 110:20:37. okay, it's going to be 38, so 38 from 60 is 22. where can i put these - don't forget to put these - -"
"ken, are you on vox this morning?"
"we're just looking at the flight plan here, and we just finished day 10, meal b, and 10 minutes from now, we got to start on day 10, meal c."
"i just wanted to give you fair warning, jack. in case you all feel a bump there when you're about ready to go to sleep there. at 73:17:45, you'll cross that magic line into the lunar sphere of influence."
can you give us a feel on the fluid intake?
we need an emergency ...
"yes. i - i see what's happening, bob. still ridiculous."
...
roger. we 're copying that.
"houston, this is jim. since fred's been in the lunar module, and since he's the lunar module pilot, this is the first time that he's felt that he's been right-side up."
"that's affirm, jack."
"eagle, houston. you can go ahead and turn your updata link switch off."
"how's the time line, bob?"
"okay. in that case, i think i '11 pull out some display breakers and just let you all keep sa eye on things."
affirmative.
okay ....
"they gave us a map update, but %hey only gave it to us on the 180 degrees."
yep.
i'd like to see that sight. why don't you give us a tv picture of that one. o1 06 52 31 c55° i think buzz is trying. you got it.
...
"ah, the old orange. okay; get an after of that, john, and a scoop. how about you - swapping, i'll bag, and you rest."
- - 09:38
got them lashed down?
percentage on the mag?
"yes, sir."
"tony, i can see into - -"
"yeah, you're right."
"i think we aren't going to have one of those tomorrow, jack, so we did away with that. we hope we're not going to have one of those tc_orrow."
roger. understand.
"america, the computer is yours."
"okay, gene, if you can get that fairly readily, why don't you - you can perhaps just scoop it up with the bag."
"number 18, houston."
"it's driving in real easy, houston."
wait a minute.
okay. ron says it ought to be open. tape18/6
time is 19 seconds.
roger. would you ask buzz to check his biomed- ical tm sensors for a loose or dried out sensor? we're getting an erratic electrocardiogr_un read- ing. that would be one of the three sternal leads. over.
"azimuth, 326."
"178, clear, 316, plus 01780. i hope we make a good ags solution here. like to do it. clear. 415, plus 10 000. standing by to make the next set of marks. okay, pete. things are looking good. man, it was spectacular looking out. you should have seen that descent stage - that - all that jazz."
"okay, i've got it."
"yes, and it - -"
"i think yours is out.... i think there's one out on your side a little. no, it's in."
"{ikay,here we go. bats 2 and 4, off/reset."
"that's correct. and for tei, the only change we'll probably make is the procedure we just passed. we'll probably let bank a - we'll probably leave bank a in the burn until we get down to about 5 seconds to _o, and the reason for this - if something happens to the banks then, we're within our rcs capability for midcourses."
"- - if you used bravo 2 and delta 1 for roll, you'll be okay just to leave that configuration and maneuver on to the next attitude. 09 23 17 36 cml° you want to use bravo 2 and delta 1. is that affirmative?"
go ahead.
huh?
it's hid in there and -
"i'm going to turn - i'm going to try the steering first, charlie."
"is that weird right down there, you think?"
- - about all this.
very good.
"roger, challenger. and we refrained from mention- ing that to ron. ·cdr-eva tell him - tell him i hope he's enjoying our scissors. okay, bob, the tv is connected to the tcu electrically. the sunshade is on. i've got to deploy the high gain."
bus ties are coming off; 1; 2's off.
"oh, boy. #** it goes. the rover looks in good shape. ###b is down there. okay. i've got all my visors down. jack, i wouldn't lower your gold visor until after you get on the porch, because it's plenty dark out here."
"103 53 - correction, 5h."
go ahead.
"okay, and if it fits in the $rc with all the other s_mples, you might put it there because the src's going to be kind of empty."

"hey, that's great! can you see the tracks? that's good. maybe - maybe you can see the alsep."
i think i'll go this way. (laughter)
"okay. my fan is running. oh 18 ho 51 _!lp is your vent flag up? i can't tell. 02 15 ho 54 cdr it's not. came off. be just a second. 02 18 hl 23 lmp *** turn it off .... oh 18 hl 29 cdr i can hear it. oh 18 41 32 d_? hear it s_in up? remember when we talked about that one? maybe when i uut my helmet on, it won't - well, that water in your suit's makine your helmet fog a bit. ch 18 _1 5_ cdr take my helmet off a minute. 04 18 41 55 lhp okay."

looks like you're going to have to cut the cue card slightly.
"okay. we had a suspicion that possibly the lm overhead dump valve was open, and it might be."
"okay; and at 197:15, we want image motion, increase. 08 04 51 57 omp stand by, please."
columbia. roger. we copy.
"yes, sir. 19 and 18."
"go ahead, aquarius."
"roger. i guess that takes care of the news for today, mike. b4 16 34 23 cmp all right. roger. (columbia)"
"it's not running, but the q mag is there. i -"
"hey, mighty fine. we're all set, too."
"okay, we need the ir, on, now."
"yes, i - may have misled you earlier about a storm system south of tasmania. it's - if there is one, it's just developing, and it's probably 20 degrees of longitude south. as i recall yesterday, there was some indication that a couple fronts were join- ing forces and moving in that direction. today, the weaker and more western front appears to have domi- nated the system, and the only area where there seems to be cyclonic circulation developing is - is that point way south of tasmania. that con- ceivably might move up and affect new zealand in a few, in a couple days, but right now i don't see how it could affect australia."
do the other one.
"_11 righty, that's tei-48, sps/g&n; 38620; 31us 0.59, plus 1.25; 168:51:56.94; plus 3052.2, slus 0704.2, minus 0137.4; 182, 117, 014; gdc alignment goes with the circ pad, two jets, 17 sec- onds. lambda ignition, minus 172.00. pad is based on the descent refs_mat, and no plane change."
i'll get them - they're already - i got to load you up.
okay.
"apollo 11, this is houston. over."
okay. that's in work. oh 04 18 37 cmp okay. looks like the dap isn't stable now. how about if i give it a verb 46?
remove ops and stow antenna lead. perform ops checkout. report ops pressure to houston. stow 0ps on engine cover. okay.
roger. standing by.
"tranquility base, houston. request you go ahead and start the warmup on the rendezvous radar."
okay.
"okay, jim. those are very close - i guess all you need to do is trim them up a bit."
"bmag mode, three of them, to att 1/rate 2, dick."

"it's a coarsely vesicular, crystalline rock - finely crystalline. looks like a - probably an anorthositic gabbro - trying to see the zap pits. for glass color, i don't have a good one yet."
"and you see some low what, pete?"
and that is assuming no midcourse 7 here at 105 hours.
"stand by, jack - or gene. we'd like for you to terminate - -"
ho16 this - hold your thing just a second. okay. wait a minute. *** i checked that for you. 0_ 18 50 05 lmp okay.
"i entered a range instead of a range rate. let me see what it says - let me see what it says. r-dot. see, bombed the hell out of it."
"okay. and, al, one question. did you get the sesc sample out of the bottom of the trench? 05 14 35 k7 cdr well, i told you the trench was kind of a miserable failure, because the walls kept falling down. and i could get a sample from the bottom, but it wouldn't be the bottom, i'm afraid."
yes.
"and, for your information, jack, i'm just going to tear into some beef and gravy and other as- sorted goodies."
okay. you got it.
okay.
okay.
i was impressed with the smoothness of the - the raised portion.
"yes, sir."
"okay, bob. i'd like to read a tge."
"well, it's sure downhill all - all the way back, isn't it?"

"oh, shucks. hey, bob, is there any way a level bubble can fail (laughter)?"
"okay. doesn't look like we got it back, huh?"
"hoaston, c_sper."
"okay. you want to read that to me, gene - the s-band?"
"stand by, gordy."
okay. down a little bit.
"oh, okay."
are you sure?
okay; let's take off your gloves. when you get do_rn.
"no, 'this clast is about 3 meters."
i know it. 0_ 12 40 50 lmp it's right on.
"and that's going into bag 397, houston."
"we're getting some samples this time. i want to get a far - an after, and i want to get a closeup stereo of that. and i'm going to get some pictures around this block, too."
okay.
yaw - our yaw is really ***
"aquarius, houston."
"ken, you look beautiful to me."
beautiful. (laughter) okay.
0keydoke.
and i'll go back in to switch. okay.
it was - -
our antennas aren't up. how's the cow_?
"oh, we're getting there, jim. we're - we're all agreed that you're almost, but not quite, in the proper attitude, and we're just trying to get you one firm recommendation on how to proceed from here."
that's right.
yes. we got more yellow pills than we know wha_ to do with.
"jack, houston. we'd like you to go ahead and get that waste stowage vent open now, so we can keep to the schedule on cabin enrichment."
*** time do we have here?
"- - as soon as possible, please."
"i got an earth orbit chart here, but i don't think anybody really cares. do you? 00 01 08 56 inp no."
about 40 feet out - i'd say out at the end of that next - -
"roger. that's the end of the tv show, we've got some work to do."
"16, your rates are okay, any time you want to go in~_optc."
okay. we copy that.
"where are the tsbs, al? they're not up here, they're down in one of those other things."
"okay, houston, verify high bit rate; and, ron, we need you in wide dead band, attitude hold."
"okay, copy that."
"okay. (laughter) oh, this is great, i'll tell you!"
you're not getting those pins all the way in.
okay.
"orion, casper. are you ready for rendezvous radar and vhf range check?"
yes. there it is. the tracks are across the mid- dle of it.
okay; and i've got plenty of oxygen so we're in good shape for an auto repress. cabin repress breaker closed at 16.
"roger, dave. drive the core right down through the rim."
"very good. very good. hello, folks."
"dead ba_e, min."
that's affirmative.
"aquarius, we're ready to secure the high bit rate."
(laughter) roger.
yeah. 170.
"well, let me get down here and start working. ouch! 06 22 48 07 _ cmp where the hell's my flight plan?"
"have that static, huh?"
that's correct.
"houston, clipper. do you have your p22 information?"
"well, i got them on like i been wearing them all week."
okay. go with the supplement.
"well, it's right on the dsecythere. 03 12 2b 00 cdr ... ob 12 23 02 cmp and the mapping camera, image motion, on. talkback barber pole b to 5 seconds, then gray. that can be done anytime; that's not important. el off at t-start; mapping camera, on, at t-start; pan camera, operate, at t-start. jesus, they got all kinds of things going on here at t-start. motion increase - talkback barber pole plus 2 steps. i better do that mapping-camera thing."
"okay, that's aligned perfectly. here we go."
no. i've got it. i just wanted to adjust this lock - locking harness *** can still reach ***
okay ... lm2 they presumably then would be about the same age.
"okay. hey, listen; i want to get a closeup of that - that contact. hold on to this a second, okay? let me get my trusty tongs. as a matter of fact, if you'll pull the bag out, jim, i'm going to get a quick selected sample here."
...
"i'll just sit here the whole time scratching _y rear. l0 0b 17 50 lmp oh, you ... (laughter)."

this is a hell of a ...
that'll be for next year's model.
better get ready to ... 03 04 57 25 sc (cough)
"- and, geno, you're leaning pretty heavy forward on that drill."
"okay, it's lo. lock pin in, and it's closed."
so you can see.

great.
"that 's affirm, gene."
"okay, gordy."
"- - right after - when did we insert, gang? twelve something?"
go.
"okay, very good. yes, i think that the - at least, it's a going bet around here that we're sampling the subfloor when we're sampling - at least the top of the subfloor when we're sampling the intermediate gabbro there. the rocks and the boulders."
"that's verified, ken. 03 23 41 50 cml° all right, sir. 03 23 44 59 cml° and, orion, i understand you're complete with your rendezvous radar transponder check .... is that affirm? 03 23 45 07 i_p that's affirm, ken."
huh?
confirm a pu shift to go at 01:45.
it is.
"we've stopped, houston. we're at alsep."
say what? 08 20 17 lb imp were you listening to your recorder last night?
"(laughter) doesn't sould like the pete conrad i know; it's usually (laughter) - it's usually, ""out of my way, gang, we've got to get going."" (laughter) why didn't you just - -"
go ahead.
"pete, go ahead."
"okay, bob, without me having to look it up, when will it come if it comes?"
we want to think positive.
use this 5 minutes as part of our rest period tonight.
"cmc in auto. yes, clock's running to rrt. yes, it is."
... food packs are stuck ...
*** at 234/2.5.
"okay, bob. we'll be with you."
okay. primary power ampl is opened.
"gee, we might even do a couple extra."
"very good. any new word on the gravimeter, gordy?"
okay.
"okay, that solves the mistery. thar_ you."
"okay. they just pointed out there's also verb 48 at 285:10, which is not applicable either. and, jack, i've got the midpac area - say again. let's do the midcourse 7 pad first. mcc-7."
"go ahead, houston. *** (columbia"
yes.
"john, verify you locked the forward hatch."
"roger, karl. going okay, i think we might have a problem also with the mass spec boom. let me give you some times here. the mapping camera retracted in 4 minutes and 30 seconds. the g,mma ray re- tracted in 2 minutes and 30 seconds. i'm sorry, the mapping camera extended in 4 minutes and 30 seconds, the g,mma ray retracted in 2 minutes and 30 seconds. and the mass spec i let retract for about 4 minutes, didn't get a gray, went to deploy for a few seconds, back to retract a few seconds, and it finally went gray and retract. so i don't really have a good accumulative time on - c_ how long it was in barber pole."
"oh, yeah? o0 o1 03 52 ia{p (laughter)"
"in 10 minutes, jack's ... good shape. okay, got that ...."
"okay, al. you can start your maneuvering to your i lm jettison attitude most anytime. and i'll up- date the attitude for you. it's roll 14, pitch 38, and yaw 344."
got your circuit breaker in?
"- - we'l like for you guys to look at in the over- head. in addition to them. we'd like the tv lens to be dusted, in addition to the regular dusting. that'll take the lens brush, remember."
go ahead.
give him the tracking light.
i tell you it's nothing on my arm - i'll tell them it's nothing.
"so, it looks like it's all tidied up for the night."
()kay. stand by.
"there's 190 on this roll. that's one-third of the way, right?"
well - -
okay.
roger. go for direct on the pgns.
"which switches do you want us to confirm? 00 01 32 h2 cc stand by. texas (rev 1) 00 01 33 i1 cc apollo 11, this is houston. you were just on the fringes of coverage from goldstone. we have just had los at goldstone, and we'd like to push on and get the pad messages read up to you here shortly."
"that's affirmative. go ahead, mike."
it's right on the money. it's asking for 95.
"no. 00 00 28 29 _ it would sure be easy to knock sc_e switches here. ·00 00 28 31 c_ yes. it sure would be. okay, that's a thing we got to watch pretty close, huh?"
"well, all right, fine. let's just get this one done first."
"and, america, the cabin is at 3 psi."
280 - -
hold it there. let me get your - keep - keep coming down. i'll push this in. okay.
"yes, f crater is - is sharp - just like - shorty. i hope i was getting f crater. f crater is about the same size as shorty, isn't it? if not, i was getting one between family mountain and -"
there's b.
"mark, this is gene again. going from the upper left to the bottom right. lines of the same sort of thing. dimly lit flashing horizon-type flashes. but they're linear. they're linear, and they tend to come from the - either the upper left or the upper right and work their way downward. now they've stopped. both eyes."
okay; thank you much.
there's a nice crater here - on the edge. maybe we hit the rim of that crater.
"two. 05 06 0h 24 lmp-lm oh, okay. okay, read the checklist. something happens at 2-1/2."
okay.
okay; commander repeat - that's done. *** let's take a drink then close the descent water.
pitch 1.
hey.

roger. how was it?
okay; that's right. cue msfn.
- - pallet.
"hey, houston. this is america. that's mighty fine."
okay. just leave it open now.
don't know what time it is.
"on the pan camera, you said to expect to see barber pole when we ran it. i did not see that just for your information. it went barber pole and then gray."
"yeah, might as well. we've got to go by that big rock. is that where we're going, to that big rock?"
"and, again, on the traverse itself, we'll skip the tv getting out, since we won't have ac and all and the high gain, and so you don't have to worry about deploying the tv and tripod, and we'll leave the tv for charlie when he gets the lcru out. we will need a few more words during the alsep deploy or, correction - during the lrv deploy, since we won't be able to watch it. and, our best guess on an alsep area is still sort of northwest of you there, but it will be completely up to you; whatever looks best. and again, the use of the uv camera, we'll - -"
...
i don't get much out of turning the front wheels.
white ring. that's right.
"roger. omit step 3; perform step 4, except for the last line. circuit breaker 16, eps inverter 2, closed."
"()kay. i can't - just look where the verbs are, charlie."
"okay, we copy that."
"uh-oh. 07 01 04 49 lmp-_ja uh-oh. ah! we missed it. 07 01 o_ 51 cdr-eva ahh, good suspension."
"i want to give that the best chance possible, too. 04 13 15 51 l\_ i know it."
yeah.
why don't you mark final comp. get you back with us.
"jack, we'd like you to verify the tape recorder, off. oh 14 50 12 lmp-lm yes, that's verified, gordy. l_°-lm gordy, how does the fuel vent look to you?"
"okay, now, earlier we had deleted that ""tape recorder, high bit rate"" line there and added it back on the hack page, and i guess now we need to move it back."
"roger, jim. and you might want to start the dac. 06 00 59 46 imp-eva bearing 345; range - yes, i'm glad you reminded me. 06 01 00 03 i/_p-eva remind me to stop it when we get there. boy, you know, looking upslope, look how much more huw_ocky it is. it's just a different - different terrain."
okay. bmag number 1 off now.
"okay, well - i'm sorry we missed those photos, but it - it sure seamed like the prudent thing to do at the time. 04 10 il 41 cc we concur."
okay. mine is giving a squeak.
"okay, fine. at 264:30, change ""purge 02 fuel cell 1"" to ""02 fuel cell purge."" and then right under that, cancel out all that mass spec exercise between 264:35 and 264:45. essentially, all you've done is take all that out and you've done an 02 fuel cell purge and then ended up with an h2 fuel cell purge."
that's done.
"apollo 13, houston."
okay.
... in the rim. ·o3 lo 59 4o amp ...?
"no, 10 degrees."

get them now? ll ll ll ob cmp okay. start out with 5-c. ll ll ll lb _ 5-c reading 4 - 4.2.
they are egress.
"that's right, in the pros."
"aquarius, houston."
"this is gene here. i'll just remark that both jack and i did see them on the lunar surface. i guess the best summation i can make of that is i think i saw both lines and - and the spots or the flashes a little bit more sharply, but that might be because of the adaptation - dark adaptation in the in prior to going to sleep was probably a little bit better. and i'd guess - it's awful hard to tell time when you're under - when it's dark, ... but i guess i want to say they were quite frequent, and i'd say that means two to three a minute now. that could be way out, but that's what i'd guess."
did you have readouts on our quad temps _.oknow when we can start? we're taking a time hack. we'd just like a verification with you.
"al, we'd like to have i - high gain, narrow and auto."
"no, i'll get it. i knew there was something i needed to do."
that's it....
roger. that separation should be 3 plus 15 03. my error in reading up. 00 02 54 55 cd_ roger.

"joe, i hope you can watch this on tv. the ground plate - i pull it down, and the spring is too strong. it pulls the ground plate up. 06 (/420 59 cc okay, jim, we watch. no problem."
"that must have been what done it. they're both spiking simultaneously. because you know, if you spike one up, it takes the fuel cell off the other."
okay. c02 select to primary. c02 light goes off.
"- - you can sample secondary craters, and they tend to have blocks either in them or on one rim, suggesting that you could tell directions if you put your mind to it. directions of the - where the secondaries came from. these are small ones."
"lpd number? yes, okay."
on the way back. okay.
okay.
"that smoky mountain is a steep-sided mountain, tony. ravine is - i got a good view of ravine here, and it's steep sided on the smoky mountain side, but very undulating on the other side - on the cayley side. and the - you can see cat crater, and it doesn't look very blocky, so i guess it's probably, it's sharper than the rest, but it's still no blocks around it."
"and, dave, you're going to be close to 279 on your heading, and i'll fine tune that in a minute."
that's what you're doing. you're supposed to tell us that (laughter).
"okay. he's getting a couple of - of whitish frags and-_hen dust-covered, gray-looking frags. think you got a bag full there, john."

try to move them.
wait a minute.
yeah.
"yes. 06 o0 l0 b5 cc okay. 06 o0 l0 b6 lmp-eva yes, i have a pan. i'll take another one probably before we leave the area, so you get a little stereo effect."

we're about there.
... 0 and - -
"well, yes, i guess that's what it'll be - it's going to be an rcs burn at about l1 foot per second. it'll drop the - it'll clrculize the orbit and then we'll do the plane change burn."
that 's affirm.

"oh boy, that's going to be terrible. that is really going to be bad."
roger; go for an aps tpi.
"and, houston, the hadley base here. tell those geologists in the back room to get ready because we've really got something for them."
"we're ... going to be two diameters out, huh?"

looks like a good job.
"okay, what do i do now? i've put the handle up and - okay, it's set on l. it's stowed. i am. i am. it's stowed. how about the gear box? okay, gear box is to latch. okay. my inner visor is down. okay."
okay. copy.

it worked. it worked.
"houston, 16. over."
okay. that didn't work. 05 23 46 19 _mp let me help you. can i read it to you or anything?
"no, if you're where you think you are, you're beyond - you're east of rudolph quite a ways."
"no, that'd really be neat; take a bunch of termi- nators. and the setting should be the same re- gardless of where the terminator went."
and i think that's all of it.

"okay. i - i guess we don't have a good answer for you on that, bob. they're all stowed away. and _-_ they've all been recorded as we've gone along. is there any particular need for them before tomorrow sometime?"
"go ahead, gordo."
roger. that's affirm. we got that.
mark cmp.
"okay, jack. go ahead with your question."
yes.
roger.
right here where we usually do it.
it's just got a fine dust on it.
r-3 is a pretty handy place for all those books up there. 00 02 03 15 izmp do we have a strap?
"... you got plenty of places in here, right?"
roger. af_ 0mni.
"stand by on that, ron. let me check in the go on that."
"turn it on. 04 17 16 32 l_ yes, but it - it hung up on the cover when it came up. it's still loose. okay, that's - -"
"hey - hey, houston. you won't believe this. now our amp-hours on battery 2 are up, and they're reading (laughter) 118 and the - and the battery - and the battery volts are reading 62. you want the whole business before we start out? the amp- hours on 1 are 118; on 2, 118; 68 volts; 68 volts; no amps, of course; and 82 degrees on the motor temps_ and offscale - 82 degrees on the batteries, and offscale low on both motor temps."
okay .... ?
"no, not yet. i was waiting until you get out of the way."
"got it - man! look, at that place. outstanding effort there, dick gordon. flash gordon pilots again !"
"okay. that, or he may want to skip one of the 60-second exposures in there somewhere, you know."
"okay, gqrdy. you want to leave the high gain until you call?"
"okay, houston. i have the closeup camera. oh 19 35 26 cc roger. still reading on even hundreds? 04 19 35 29 l_ i'm not vhere yet. 04 19 35 hh l_[p didn't want that to get away from me, but it did. got it. okay. houston, it's turned on, ana iz's reading 300."
okay. that sounds good.
yes. 04 23 06 $9 l_° good show.
"roger. we copy that. but there's a greater duty cycle on - there's a good 15-percent duty cycle on the ascent program there, so just go ahead and leave it off. and i have the changes there if you want to get out your surface checklist, and i can go ahead and start giving them to you. 05 o] 42 59 cdr ail right. go ahead. i've got it out. (tranq )"
and we would like the sep turned on before you leave - -
"well, i don't know if i co_ied the cnes that you think you gave. i copied some that said, ""imc to barber pole, and pan c_era, st._'_dby,stereo, power,"" and then something got started about orbit- al science photos, and that was all i got."
"roger. understand, ken. i'll stand by."
"okay. aquarius, negative on the pgns self test. 02 12 57 37 imp okay. i'll scratch page 6 and on page 7, we're not going to activate the - or rather we had the s-band activated, ecs activation i have all done. and, at the bottom of the page, the docked imu coarse aline is done."
"as far as i know, tony - yeah, yeah, i just want to make sure that there's no misu_derstanding on our part about what it is we're supposed to do, because we took only those frames that were se- lected, because we are aware of the tight budget."
okay. iatp-eva darn.
and it's blue-gray with light colored - -
roger.
cabin gas return is egress. okay. ready for the ops hookup.
"and it's sad to shut off the sim bay, it's operated so tremendously in this mission."
got some more parochial news here - -
... 'onfid:
"yes. (laughter) no, that's - that's not from up here. at least i don't hear anything like that."
"you've got the waste vent open down there, and this is how we're purging the cabin. okay?"
"look at that, charlie."
see if it'll hook to the bottom one.
... okay. cover's closed. belt.
s-band voice going to voice.
... on the ...
that's affirmative.
"okay, houston, we have capture."
"okay; let me check off. off, off, off."
roger.
"apollo 15, houston. it's retract time."
"okay, houston. are you monitoring my angles? it appears that it might be less then 1 degree per second."
yes.
... coming up _.. to a0s ...up to - be ready for aos.
...
"aqm_rius, llou_ton."
"intrepid, houston. go ahead."
"(laughter) yes. all right. 04 17 18 35 _p i think they put champagne instead of iodine in the hi water this time, okay."
you keeping him boresighted?
they are actually a secondary from - that's probably a big rock clot from- 07 01 03 20 cdr/ from north ray. imp-eva
"is that where you want it; facing down or in? you don't want it there, do you?"
"0hhh, there's almost a view right into that crater."
okay; 31245.
why does it look rounder coming around this way than it does when you go into the terminator; it looks straight on the other side.
bats - guess what.
don't see any rocks. here let me - let me do _- this. i
"there was that awful big storm up off the coast of alaska in the bering sea, i guess it was yesterday. i can't see that now, though. i think you all are in the dark."
don't waste time on it; i'll just hang on.
"okay, houston, the landing radar test is not working properly."
"okay, i'm holding it."
"how do you read forward omni? you got a - start your pitch maneuver, john."
"that's affirmative, fred. that question has been banged around and we decided to go that way. 0_115 55 38 lmp let's see, we will be powering other bus via the cross tie balance loads breaker. is that correct?"
"and if you want to write ""hallelujah"" or something in there, we're back on the nominal plan again. 07 05 22 05 c_ (laughter)"
down the ...
i don't know ... you'll lose these bags.
"dave, just out of curiosity, we know you or a1 - -"
"0k_;, it j'_mped up to 200 increase."
"it looks green. and i - i noticed just downslope from the rock, you kicked up the surface and there's some more green there."
that's affirm.
you do?
to lock those hand controllers. it's not on any of them - that i know of. 03 15_55 18 cdr main bus ties are off. null - null residuals - and right here.
my general impression is that there is an awful lot of fragments i'm busting up down there.
okay. that'll be fine.
(laughter) that platform- -
"well, what we're thinking about is if we did ask you to take off that astroconnector on the heat flow experiment, you may have to lift the station _ up to get underneath to the little lever."
"- - cross-sun - okay. going back across sun - the tracks, we just barely penetrated the regolith maybe an eighth of an inch or so. whatever it is, it's going to be real firm here. hopefully, we can get - isn't 13 a double-core one?"
okay.
huh?
okay. what's that read; there's 180.
"okay. and comment on the dust on the battery mirrors. do not brush them, though."
"*** to take tge, of course, as we planned. take it off, and we'll try and get both a gray and a bias reading. you might initiate one of them now. we'll initiate another one later on. we've got plenty of time while it's sitting on the ground there to - to do our thing with it."
okay. we're standing by.
"we in darkness? 07 07 55 15 i2_p yeah. _fnink that must be him, that brig_ht star u_ there."
"16, go omni bravo and we'll take over switching it for you."
roger. imp-eva - - and i_p is - lmp is 56 percent.
you going to do it right there?
yes.
"okay, perhaps we can read the torquing angles, if you want to give them again."
i'll get them. let me get them; they're easier.
okay.
okay.
"so, let me have your h_m_er because i'm going to have to pry off the dome."
roger. the capture latch is in the probe or engaged in the drogue. would you like to set them from your side?
...
no problem.
dadg_tlit! that thing came off again. 06 05 oh 16 cc it my haw_ a bad latch in it.
"except for - move your wire, jim."
and at 199:45 - - 08 05 52 37 cml° all right. go ahead.
"okay, 02 flow indicator is less than a half. it is. it's reading - well, wait a second. let it stabilize here. got another accumulator cycle."
"okay. i'm going to get to work in a minute, just as soon as i take a look at trident."

"yeah, go ahead."
"okay, and that - that last point is just the dps available curve with 265."
"tony, i'm taking this lens brush and cleaning off this camera."
"and, the panorama is complete. *** and the lm - got the lm at 7 30 position at about 60 feet."
roger.
"okay, engine arm is descent. i think the tapemeter drove. i'm not sure."
it's off.
roger.
"we're ready to have to 02 tank 2 fan off, and thank you."
yes. cabin warning light off. verify cabin pressure stable at 4.6 to 5. we're at 4.6. 04 11 16 23 cdr/ stable. lmp-lm 04 11 16 26 lafp-lm time to take off gloves. 04 1t 16 27 cdr-lm alright. let's doff gloves. stow on comm panel.
"11, that's real good camera work."
roger.
and the light's still on.
yes. document some of that. here's a rock right here.
bring it to me.
"okay, joe. i copy."
"and, gordy, it's gray. would you like me to cycle it?"
"roger. we tad good high bit ra_e data, and they're pouring over chat now. 01 14 34 39 c_l_ okay. i'll sit _ight then. than_ you."
"that's affirmative. on panel 1: rotation control power, normal. that':_ two of them, to ac/dc."

"sixty percent? 09 o0 lb 34 cmp sixty percent of the mag, yes."
"ll, houston. we also would apprecia:;e - if you will note the angles that the antenna tracks through in its attempt to reacquire. over."
"okay, jack. we need another one of those voltage amps readouts and then maybe we will get off of your back for a little while."
"yes. okay, there's a quarter of a pound. still tight, huh? let her drop. rest a minute. let her drop."
"well, they're fun enough. i wouldn't mind."
i thirz_ this has been a long damn sim. the son of a bitch.
"endeavour, we'd like to have pan camera power, off."

"okay. going b, houston. lmp on b."
oh - -
go ahead.
"yes, sorry about that. but - -"
"let me get your harness - i might just as well do it, so it's right. if it's worth doing at all, it's worth doing right. now, let me try getting that bag back on. no, don't bend over, i can't get down there."
can't imagine -
- - plus or minus 65.
"and, fredc, to complete this description - -"

go ahead.
"no. it's just in the procedures. it's been that way. they said that - that if the solutions agree close enough to pass the test, to keep them independent."
"joe, we're about 2 minutes into the cdr's 02 charge."
"okay, houston, we turned on the hydrogen purge line heaters; maybe we can gat this purge off a hair early."
okay. cabin repress is open.

"yes, i'm sure they are."
need some help?

"that would get me out of the way. c_ okay, just a second. okay."
it's in.
"yes. i think we've got enough of those now, gene. you got the maps?"
'i read you loud and clear. do you read me?
...
3.8.
"endeavour, houston. over."
"okay, this is geno. what was that number on the lunar sphere of influence?"
"you know, all i did was eat for 3 days. and now i don't even get a chance to eat."
"hey, houston. we have about a minute to go. we're tracking 39 and 30 on the pressures, and 0rdeal's about 0."
"oh, man, you're right. it keeps popping out. 05 06 48 36 lmp-i_ there you got it."
"don't move too fast. boy, your feet look like you just walked on the moon, you know."
"*** cold; but that's good. okay. on 16, ecs, cabin repress, closed."
good. we got it.
"i don't mean barber pole. i mean gray (laughter). well, whatever it was, it changed."
yes.
"okay, i'll show you this one."
okay. 05 13 15 oh cdr ... get to the bottom of that baby.
"okay, let's go through this, and i'll get the update when it comes up. throttle control, auto."
that's affirmative.
"well, i can do it. but -"
"oh, i ought to get - let me get over to the other side - you can get the rover in the background."
"first nigh{? first 5 minutes. i told those doctors when we hit that deck, i want a shower. i've been there before, and i ain't putting up with anything else. i ain't gonna do nothing."
"roger. next one's on 84:24, 84:24."
that will be before entering p52. i am going to give you this procedure in detail. 05 07 04 38 cml° okay. ali right. let's go at it. maybe it'll all fall out and i won't have any questions. go ahead.
"oh, thank you, joe. okay, jim, i'm going to get over here and open the door. 06 19 25 59 imp ..."
"gordo, 2.9."
"okay; i understand. at 201:30, you want the laser altimeter left on, and the mapping camera left out and the covers, open."
"and next page, after the ordeal start time, change that to 57:20 rather than 57 even."
"there's a1 thinking again, another way to save money."
"yes, it needs to come over this way more. it's not going to go any further on the other side of the bulkhead there."
okay. - -
"okay, houston. we're 1.3 on - delta-p and coming - coming up."
okay. thank you.
0ops. excuse me.
...
"and endeavour, you're about 30 seconds from your pan camera."
are you in power off?
"okay. guess you can open that breaker, and i'll stop shivering. (laughter)"
"okay, 6-d is 45."
"hey, you' re -"
okay; we're moving at about 5 clicks. and the slope - i'd guess about 6 - 6 or 7 degrees on going cross-slope.
whoop.
"roger_ copy that. 02 02 32 16 cm!o okay, don. i'm ready to copy some things now."
roger.
"jack, did you call?"
"houston, 15."
"gene, you got a bag?"
okay. landing radar check - -
"no, no, look at this stuff. 05 12 41 59 _ hey, that's interesting."
"geno, then you'll have to give us a hack on 1 psi if you can."
it's 2:30. everybody will be asleep. i going to sneak off through the back way.
"you can push the - you can push the hook about an inch away from the ring, but the normal - just a resting position on the thing is about a finger's width or 1/2 inch from the ring."
it's start.
"it also suggests that the mare in here's relatively thin if you're getting down to whatever the basement rock is and that's being represented by the light gray. the legends [?] of the blue-gray material are high up in the crater ana really appear to form only about - oh, a fifth to a sixth of the wall height. and i_ii give you a crater - there's a crater right between the two cauehy rilles that shows this fairly we_l. a_a ross crater also shows it a iitt±e farther along, i remember from last time. c.v_ cauchy craver, isn't it? l?[p yes, cauchy craver is the one z was talking abo_t that's be%ween %he two rilles. actually, iv's not as well defined in cauchy as it is in scm_ of she other cravers."
we're about 3 miles higher in altitude.
roger. must be getting towards s_mertime down there.
do what?
"..., ..., and tomorrow night ..., except most of those pictures would be in the open .... pictures of the lunar surface. i think it'll probably ... a couple of days ..."
"challenger, you'll be glad to hear you're stay for t-1."
"0ooh, boy, give me a verb 76. 04 ll 50 01 i24p you got it."
i'll do my best.
"okay, go."
that's affirm.
"go out here, john, and see if i can find a - a landmark to get lined up on."
"okay. well_ then that sounds like - if that's an up-to-date position, it has relatively little movement since yesterday°"
roger; copy.
"oh, yeah."
smoke over the numbers at 730.
now.
okay.
"okay, next. black-and-white tv camera, and rec- ommend stow that on top of a-7 and a-ii in decon- tamination bag. next: flag kit, stowage location a-8. next: lm fecal bags, used, r-9, waste man- agement system chute."
"okay, houston. she's continuing to come."
"that's correct, jim, and your noun 44 is na and plus 0022.3; and readback's correct. 09 04 32 40 _ roger; copied. _ is plus 0022.3."
"yes, we're just wondering if maybe the - maybe it was an air bubble or something in there - in the - small g-riel d of that midcourse 7 burn might have changed something. just like to take a look at it. cml° okay. we'll take a look at her."
stand by please.
"go ahead, enter."
roger.
"that's it, jack."
...
how about the cyclic accumulator? just a second.
"okay, tony, i'm clear on the flags. my frame count is 65; got -"
"if you'd like some help being coached on to this next star, it's in cassiopeiae, and we're suggest- ing detent 3; be a spiral of 181, a cursor of 23, and it should be just to the left of navi - the bright star to the left of navi."
probably the best you're going to be able to do.
"i'll tell you what, why don't you park the rover ·while i make sure everything's under the lm, and we'11 dust when we get back. okay?"
okay. thank you.
"that's what i thought. right about 20 feet ahead of me, right? 05 11 53 57 _'_p ye3, yes."
"jack, on the first of the lpd angles is about a minus 2 degrees and just slightly above the top line."
"roger. and, dave, the diverter valve is yours."
please.
i can't - where is my stupid tool? there it is.
"all right. 03 04 53 19 cml° houston, apollo 11. how about coming up with some roll, pitch, and yaw angles in which to stop this so-called orb rate that i'm doing."
"okay, you'll come down pretty slow .... - -"
"that's excellent. i - i also have science report, which you can probably pick up on the next rev, and consumables report. and i guess we would like a status report from you. we could either do that now or early in the next rev. how do you feel about it?"
"okay, waste water dump. the potable is full; the waste is about half full - 40 percent. i think - 8 minutes. i'll set the clock for 6."
"_ite dots ol_ plus eva decals. 05 22 07 04 lm_ *** mine are ,configured."
"aquarius, that's the contingency checklist."
yes. 00 02 50 lh cmp it'll be high; it'll come across.
"looks like pristine material, all right."
- - 210.
"that's true, but i'm saying that - oh, never mind."
no comment.
what were they?
"throttle control, ma_,_al_ commander. 04 13 04 3_ _? manual; com_,_nder."
okay. the reactant valve is going to ...
okay.
yes. didn't we tell you?
okay.
got it again by hitting the panel.
it's the wrong way. don't open it - don't open that.
"burn complete. (_,.c.-._)"
"okay, tape recorder's on high bit rate, record, and forward."
"okay, houston. we think we're down to 117:03 now. what time have you got?"
"oh, that - eecom advises that looks pretzy gooa now."
"man, the old pallet is closed - boxed right in there. look at that beauty."
no.
"jack, we're just more or less trying to fill up our data book down here and if you haven't already done one, we'd - like any free time, if ron would run another null bias check just to see if the drift changed when we did that little bitty burn. 12 11 gl 19 la5° okay. i'll mention that to him."
negative. drive the core where else you think might be convenient.
okay.
"what you looking for, dicky-dick?"
yes. that's a good idea. why not? see if it works. and you're clear.
"stand by for .,. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, l0.... 05 03 09 44 cml:' stand by ... seconds .... 8, 9 - 6"
"okay, al. right on. and could you verify for us, please, that the alpha particle spectrometer has been turned on and that the x-ray and alpha particle _-- covers are open. over."
"okay, and leave a little space if you can to the right of these because when we talk about the backup procedure, why then we can just use the same listing, aad i'll - i'll tell you open in- stead of close these circuit breakers, or at least most of them. over."
"jim, that's negative. we don't have any data on you. low bit rate."
i know you are.
"here, i'll help you rig this thing. hold this ... 07 04 34 ll i24p why don't i hand it to you?"
"i ain't sure that's the right thing, but i know it --"
"okay, orion -"
"mapping camera, off. ·"
"roger, karl. would you go back and recheck the attitude - the attitude for the - uv - pictures - pictures of the moon?"
okay. seems to work.
...
roger.
"yes, i think we can; it doesn't look too bad .... right now, doesn't show anything obvious, except that's where the boulders start. and on up the hill you have ... - (_617 59 06 cc okay. we hope that's fairly obvious."
"okay, there you go."
"15, this is houston. the next several attitudes are going to require us to use omni delta, and we suggest that you go manual and wide and stow the high gain antenna."
"yes, the color difference - again the - you know, i just - i just now noticed that when i get down at this sun angle, out in front of me, i got one color, and then i look straight down and i have a different color. but in _his tacquet area, you've definitely got some cinder cone type - no, i don't want to say cinder cone, but anyhow - volcanic. and it almost looks like a breached cinder cone right next to - i think it's melrose [?] - is the name of that - that crater - the big one that's right on the edge of serenitatis. i'll find it on the map and mark it for sure. but just to the east of that, it sure looks like a breached cinder cone in - in - in one of those rilles down there. and then that type of material is - is - kind of a dark tan in - at this sun angle. and it's definitely darker than the - than the serenitatis basin material."
"okay, how far are we from ei?"
"oh, just fine. you guys are doing a superb job; really beautiful. hey, we spent some time on this - fender problem and worked out a pretty simple-minded procedure, which involves essentially taking four of those chronopaque pages out of your lunar surface map, ones which are not going to be used for discussing the site, taping them to- gether with gray - gray tape so that you end up with a piece of paper about 15 inches by 10-1/2 inches, and then using the aot lamp clamp_ preposition them full opened, and taking them out, and taking that piece of paper out, laying it on top of the fender guide rails and - and clamping the edges of it with the aot lamp clamps. it's simple and straightforward, and the beauty of it is you're only spending about 2 minutes in the clamping operation, and it could save you up to about 12 dusting, i think maybe. what do you think?"
40 meters.
"a lot better. say, ed, you don't need to stop talking when i talk, if you can do both at once. 04 18 52 24 ixmp okay. i have a little trouble listening to you and talking at you, too. not polite (laughter). okay. i'm bringing it back in and coming around through the west-northwest, and you should be able to see in the distance doublet crater. and i_ve lost it now because of the sun angle, but it's c(j fiden,t iiim just about on the - on the near horizon. i'm sorr2r, there are three mounds, three ridges. the nearside - the nearest one - the ridge that doublet is on and then the far horizon. and i'm bringing them - bringing it on out for you. doublet is on zhe second - second hill that you see. pick it up out there, bruce?"
"okay, we got about a 90-degree there, dave."
yes.
"affirmative, ken."

"and, ken, if we have to do that, we'd suggest you mark a place down there so that, during the sub- sequent ptcs · you can just set the thing to that mark."

roger. imp see ...
"okay. i understand that. in that case, we'd like to take a piece of tape and tape the cover down to keep it closed when it's not - when it's supposed to be closed. the feeling is that if the cover flaps partly open, you may get specular reflection off the inside of the mylar down onto the mirrors causing it to heat up during the drive when it's supposed to be closed."
negative. you can hold off until after the photos.

okay.
that way we'll be sure.
"okay. kepler ray pattern is very striking in this light - an anastomoting - losing series of - of bands which only average being radial. in most cases, they're a little off radial, but by joining together, they give you a general radial pattern."

"okay. we're back in business. and i'm - while i'm waiting for gene, getting a rock - it looks a little finer grained than the others we've seen in the lr¥ sampler, along with some soil. and that's done. hey, that's a neat sampler. only way to fly. okay, and that's in bag 22e. it has the stereo docmllen- tation and a /ocator to the lm, and it's about 2 meters from the s - from the sep."

"okay. i'm taking a look at our attitude for the uv photos. we see we need a roll of 153, and your update today gave us a roll of 050 degrees. and, it seems like we probably ought to stop the roll at 153, and just skip that 050-degree atti- __ tude so we can save the maneuver."
"roger. and, over at 141:55, i guess we're having a look at photo target 25, and there is a friendly little note that goes with this. it says to be performed only if the cmp feels it won't interfere with his eat period. so, this is your choice. do you want some numbers?"
"just a second, please."
okay. it's off. and i confirm that one.
okay.
yes.
"okay. well, since i really had very little say-so as to which - which people get selected for which crews, i might sort of bypass it with the - with the one comment that i think the more qualified a man is on the moon, the more results you're going to get. and i think that's one of the rea- sons that we put as much time as we did into the geological aspects, in hopes of - of learning enough to bring back some significant data. i think that, in any situation such as this, in any scientific endeavor, that you want the most qual- ified people possible. you must also remember that this is a - a highly complex operational mission. it requires a great deal of - of training and skill in order to fly these machines. i think, in par- ticular, jack schmitt - schmitt is a very highly qualified individual in both aspects. and i be- lieve it's up to the - the management, that when they select the crews, to select the best people for the flight. that all right?"

that's affirmative.

"not a thing, dave. beautiful job all around."
outstanding.

"while we were - while we were ... i guess the weight was 25 pounds, 10 percent. 03 04 57 58 cml° man, it's frustrating when one of these things pops those things in and out. wonder what it is that makes it do this; it doesn't do it when you look at it. it only does it when you hit the binoculars. one other picture. 03 04 58 09 _ waste water dump still open?"
roger.

"25. 05 21 36 06 l_ attitune/trai_slatioi, l,jets."

okay. the bypass switch is coming on.
i think that would do it.

"yes. and they just don't quite look as - let enough light through_ i don't think, in earthshine. in other words, you can see better with the naked eye_ but they don't - they don't let enough light through the binocs to enhance your image capability at all."

"ron, houston. we're watching your 52, and you can go ahead and torque."
yes; that's what i'm thinking.
yeah.
"roger. reading you about one-by. looks like we picked a super attitude here for ptc stabilization. we're readinf, you in backup voice now. over."
would you?
"endeavour, a news bulletin from the surface says that they are now depressing the cabin; and there is no need for you to acknowledge. keep eating."
(laughter) yeah.
"go ahead, houston."
"no_ better yet, why don't you gather some soil? we gave it"
"you got - you got the etb unstowed? 05 00 15 13 lma°-eva yeah, it's all done, john. cameras are up."
okay. we got 20 seconds or so.
okay.
stand by. we're still getting the up-link.

fire.
"hello, recovery; america, is through 2000 feet. r-1 recovery, roger."
"roger. we were more curious about the rela- tive amount of moisture between, say, last night and the night before, both of which would have the lm missing."
"... 09 01 36 40 _ i can't hear you. can you get squelch, enable on? there's so much noise in the s-band. i can't hear anything. yes, i can hear you now."

ail right.
"it's done. going for 18 now. i'll check the rcs and ever_%hing for you. looks beautiful, pete. you know, it's very interesting; every time the thrusters fire, those reg's bounce."
"roger, ron; we got all tnat. c[_ okay."
"sure, why not. let's do it."
okay. we need the up link breaker in then now.

"okay, i'll try that. you mean the locking device on the lens itself?"
"yes, it's a rather wondrous thing. when you get around to it, i've got a hydrogen tank 1 call. i'd like to have you turn that to off."
and we throw in a couple of purge valves then.
a reminder to go to f/4 and 1/250 on the last six pictures.
"roger. we saw you up stirring around, and we thought that you were probably eating _'our break- fast there. just in general, we'll probably start coming up with the uplink of the state vectors and the target loads and what have you at about 190 50, somewhere in that area, and get you started to work."
"hey, jack, remember that's on top of those wobbly legs and - or wobbly springs there. and with the thing not being straight, you shouldn't really expect the level bubble to be level after the thing's been deployed. that happened at the cape a couple of times, remember? _p-eva yes, but bob, i've - i've moved this practically all the way down the full throw and it - that bubble won't move, and i can't get it to move by tilting it; and i was level. and the bubble on the top of the central station is still level."
yes.
okay.
"ron, ron, how's the hatch? get down on the hatch. your ops isn't fitting through the top. pull your- self down. straight forward. face down. nose down. now back."
"hey, challenger; america."
roger. understand all you could see was parts of the immgoing out. what was your - your first - first comment? over.
how's the old man doing?
"apollo ll, houston. we believe we've tracked down the reacquisition problem we had on the previous rev. it looks like it was a receiver power sup- ply here on the ground and no problems in the spacecraft at all. over."
smooth start and steering's good. 00 02 28 45 i2_p 2:28 - -
"okay, jack. do you read now?"
thank you. apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription
did i hit it?
old tsb charlie. o0 00 47 36 _ it is so white and pretty.
"the cells tend to be somewhat polygonal. let's see, we've been going 6 minutes - 4 minutes into the heating part of it, and the - the cells are polygonal, but they don't seem to be quite as - as straightlined as they were on the ground."
okay. i don't change. i'm already there. (laughter)
"i'm glad you still have reservations, though. your grmma, by the way, is right on 6.5 as close as we can tell right now."
"no, they want to do it now. okay, houston, we're in secondary. on that lioh canister, charlie's changing now. i 04 21 16 28 cc oh, okay."
"okay, let me try you now. i'm off your shoulder. uh-oh, did i turn your comm? no, it's on."
"yeah, charlie's on aux water."
that's correct.
and remember we talked about parking on the south- east rim.
okay; stand by.
"roger, al; we're watching you."
on in a minute. yes.
"houston, casper [sic] is out of his bag; and we go% the s-ivb in the window. and the tv is transmitting pictures of it now, and if you want _o do yo_ _a- neuver with iv, we're well clear."
"and it's also dark down on the inside of it. i still don't have a feeling for the relative size cf things. i'll try to get that one in the next - next pass around through here. but that's what i would call a small, maybe even in the - thousand- meter bracket. probably somewhere in there. tape 88b/_"
"and be sure to get the thing to external before you cover it there, gene. 06 2b bb 51 cdr-eva okay. that was going to be a question of mine. it's external."
"no, no, we're not. here's 20 right here, and we're only 17 here."
"... one, houston."
thank you.
"okay, i have it."
"roger. the weight of the rcu was 12 ounces. (tranq) that was by itself without the bag, and the weight of the water from the cdr's plss was 12-1/2 ounces. that's reading zero with the bag on."
"challenger, houston. you're go at 2 minutes. we'd like ags to mode control auto. over."
we'll fill it. just a minute.
"any time you need us, gordy, just interrupt me."
okay. we're inside of a minute.
"okay, dave and jim; houston with a comm check. do you read? over."
"okay. i - i see a - a small circular object there just - juss to the right about - the handle, and i don't see anything covering it."
_at didn't fix it.
yes. to the north.
okay. we copy that.
"roger, ron. aren't they on ... heads the same way they were on the backup unit the other evening in the white room - on the lamp?"
"bob, 45 - -"
okay.
you know - evidently you definitely had a cdu glitch. we're trying to come up with an attitude that you can fly to on the ball as it stands right now in scs. standby.
322.94.
"wait a minute, charlie, take up on the mesa and let me roll this cord."
okay.
and we're rolling.
"houston, this is apollo 15. over."
i'm afraid we'll knock it over if i set it any- where else.
okay.
5 1/2 down. (eagle)
"okay. same old proble_n, huh?"
put them in this htc right here.
contact light.
hold/fast. go on.
"got one little chunk coming out - it just came out of the sla, and it's spinning along the long axis, and it looks very stable."
"""anything you need, give us a call."""
roger. how do all our systems look?
"okay, ken. i got some more words on that question you had about - where i said verify the dse with the bistatic. that should be - should be ""verify"" rather than ""configure."""
"that's what i figured. so a 30-degree transfer angle - at 15 minutes, we should have 2 milliradians - -"
that's about 1oo degrees east and gonna be about 25 miles high. i got that out of our spiffy - spiffy little p29. he's doing longitude now. get that. that wasn't a bad guess. we're now at a 121 and bb miles high.
"okay. and i've run cdh, here; and it looks like minus 9 and minus 8, roughly. shows me 59 seconds early at tpi. okay, and we're not going to make the - that doesn't look like we need to make the out-of-plane. so, we are down in the noise level on out-of-plane. dick's showing 0.4 foot per second; and i haven't looked at it yet, but i will in a minute."
that's a beautiful picture with just an edge of the moon coming out of eclipse.
"however, if you're interested in going to south america, the whole continent looks - looks pretty good. a few clouds; but, for the most part, you can see the entire continent."
"okay. we show you should have gotten in the trench site sample, the core tube samples from the end - from the bottom, and also the gas analysis sample."
"what fred is opening up - is a drink bag that we place inside of our neckring that will allow us to drink while we are on the lullar sur- face. they - pete and a1 - did not have that on apollo 12 and they, consequently, got very thirsty. but we hope to alleviate that situation by having our own little bag of water which, with very little effort, we can have a sip or two while we are looking around and doing our geology work. 02 07 28 33 imp so if you hear any funny noises, it is just probably the drink bag."
"apollo 11, houston. we're ready for you to start your waste-water dump at this time. over."
"read the checklist, jim."
okay.
roger. we copy. the light level for the tv is really excellent. over.
guess you're right.
"how did i get the world's greatest cold on the moon, for christ's sake?"
here you go.
"huh? oh, no, i just let it - i'm flying it. i was just trying to save some gas."
okay.
"hey, my - my ... 03 12 21 10 l_p are we supposed to be doing any photography at all on this .. ·,"
"hello, houston; yankee clipper here."
we're starting into our equipment prep for eva-2.
you got what you want?
"i agree, because taking notes is good when you're having dropouts, but it's hardly the same as tapes."
"hey, yeah. can we do that now?"
we did. i wouldn't want - -
"tony, there was no trouble at all with the - with the pressure sealing zipper or the pressure seal. it was just the - the restraint. it was just in that one place in the small of my back."
mark.
"okay, bob. power on the pan camera now."
"roger, jim. copy. and shortly, you'll be - -"
"where are you? you ready to take them back - - i_p-eva i'm back over here. what i want is a sample of this soil off one of these rocks. ·cdr-eva okay, let's get that now and then let's get the rake sample."
"well, ... - -"
"aquarius, houston."
twenty-six =_nutes to go before ignition.
i'm going to. i'm going to zero and ...
"the bottom of that crater, now, had material that was extremely disorganized in its aspect and, really, we didn't have time to ex_mlne it in de- tail in order to decide why it was disorganized. it did not necessarily look like the boulder that we sampled at the rim."
that's where we are.
okay; lcru is going pm1/narrow band.
"that's what we're watching for, and i get - the real change comes up - oh, me - -"
"yes. 05 00 26 20 i2_p-eva if you want to hold it there, i'll get in front of it - -"
"yes, i'll stand by here."
see that one right in front of it? take a pic- ture of it.
roger; copy. we'll do that after john finishes marking.
"- - just want to get some info - engineering in- formation here. apparently, your front wheels are tracking straight ahead, is that correct?"
"and, dave, while he is doing that, could you tell us how far away and in what direction is the large block which you described?"
"all right. any particular reason? i mean - i would - i would have guessed some of the other things, but not that."
"16, houston. were you trying to transmit? we heard a little noise on the loop there and looks like our data was dropping in and out; looks good now."
"yes, it's unlocked."
roger.
"okay. the throttle, your's to min and mine to soft stop."
okay.
"you're chickens, huh?"
scissors floated out. hmm.
"and give us auto on the high gain. and, al, we're not going to bother with your - p27 pad readup, unless you're especially wanting it."
roger.
roger.
"put that in there, too?"
just a moment.
"oh, shoot. 1.2 kilometers is a long way from the lm. look at the challenger down there. makes you get a feel for how big this valley really is."
looks like ...
"i'm sorry, bob. i already did that when we stopped at the station."
"take number 4, and change shu - shutter setting to 1/8th."
"go ahead, houston."
okay.
"_a, uplink squelch, enable .... minegoes off. [pplink squelch, enable. okay, s-band - my s-band to t/e; ics to t/r; relay to off; mode, vox, max; a to t/r, receive. okay."
"bob, i'm only going to spend another minute or two on the fender."
"pete, that's no problem."
"that's about the size of the situation. apollo 15 air-t0-ground voice transcription /--_ 08 22 47 09 cc 15, houston. if you're willing to listen, i have about a 3-minute update on the morning news."
(laughter)
all set.
"ken, can we get a shield on, ga?z'iaray?"
"okay, was it uncomfortable or did it cause your vision to degrade or anything like that?"
okay; copy that.
we'll stand by until your call.
"what's pitch attitude, ken?"
(music - with their eyes on the stars)
okay.
"okay. 185:57:25; 186:02:15; 03:55; and 04:43. it's south 03 nautical miles. cml° okay, 17-1. 185:57:25; 186:02:15; 03:55; 04:43; south 3 miles."
thank you. i'm checking some of this s_uff off. yes.
roger. how is everything down there?
just remember what jan says. don't spill it on your flight suit.
"okay, you want to get my bag off?"
"okay. roger that, fred."
"roger, 11. correction on my last, at 73 20, we uplink you the new refsmmat. and at 73 30, we'd like you to maneuver to 0 roll, 0 pitch, 0 yaw in the old refsmmat. and then torque around to the new refsmmat and run your p52 option 1 in that same inertial attitude. over."
yes. i even forgot to listen for the ding on that one. thank you.
"we don't see any ray pattern, i would say. they're fairly generally scattered."
"oh, great !"
"okay, one last little check is optics power is on. we'd like it off eventually. i expect you haven't gotten that far yet, al."
"okay, tony, let me describe what it is. the top centimeter of the regolith is gray, and you get down under that, and it's white."
got to be ...
"okay. okay, for the ptc initiations at 260 plus 44 and 264:01, we'd like to change the ptc procedures and the g&c checklist to keep the ptc coning with- in plus or minus 3 degrees in pitch and yaw. okay, if we could go to the g&c 8-2."
no ...
thank you.
roger.
"oh, okay. very good. i'm about to lose my radar on you."
"we're going to give gene his auto mechanic's license if it works. 05 18 14 57 cml° how's my - yes, right. how's my zpn? ail i did was move it. i didn't put in a new sensor yet. do i need to put on a new sensor?"
"ar. how do you hear, pete?"

okay.
"oh, christ. i'm putting it all over your face here_"
"okay, ron. you came back in; i didn't get all of that. understand you ran out of film. and s_ _ the other."

thank you.
yes. we'll - i'll stay in the present attitude.
"okay, y'all are just about dead center, tony, in the - the high gain."
"charlie's audio breaker's closed. okay, going to a. wheel. you get a tone on, a vent flag p, a press flag 0, and 02 mom. j, a plss 02 pressure gage rated 85 percent. check with me and houston."
that's correct.
"oh, okay. sounds good. c_ it's in the volkswagen pocket. okay. 09 ih _o 05 c}p i don't think we ever changed it though. okay_ the arrow's there, which indicates vha_ '_edi_n'l do it. okay, lioh canister change, 19 into a, take 17 and put it into a - a-4. that's correc5. 09 __ __ 17 cmp a3 24, we want the pan camera."

that a boy.
"roger. are you ready to go on with changes? 02 19 56 05 cml° yes, sir."
"no, i've got them. they are going to give me a clock delta, state vector, verb 66, two refsmmats, and an entry target load."
"tranquility, houston. do you still hear it now? over."
bowen - bowen isn't much of a crater on the map.
"okay, fredo. _ou're going to have a real practical problem here. probably be able to see what the lur_ar dust does to a camera lens."
"okay; right in the middle of this little exercise, the iss warning light comes on."
"you can tell, joe, i have the geo pallet on the back end of the rover. i don't know whether it's locked on there properly yet."
anything else before i go over to the lm?
the longest napierian trajectory in the world.
sure enough; there it is.
"okay; we're standing by for your cue on mapping camera, on, and self test."
"say that again, jack. i missed that. 0.6 on system test 7a?"
cm rcs propellant at bk. we want those closed.
"casper, if you still read, the surgeon says you got your heart rate up to 90 now."

"okay, i've been sitting here thinking about it. yes, i had - and also the glitch occurred when i did the final enter, so - plus we had the two-axes glitch and a number of things. i'm - i'm glad you confirmed that. makes me feel better."
here we go.
"al, this is houston. we don't think there's any- thing that - that you can do to help us at the moment."
have a nice cool one set up.
"houston, aquarius."
... push the button. now hold that down.
are we going to use your -
okay. i know the area. i'm not sure we're gonna have enough light to see down in there in the eva attitudes but we'll take a look at it.

"okay. man, that looks good."
do you want me to load the lrv sampler?
i want to take a red and a blue picture of the landing site sometime.

"that's right. well, they are going to - they are going to try and get it worked on for tomorrow so that only the csm loop will go in there. they just had to finally give up on it and go watch the - the surface work on television because over where the loop was, it was just too much."
what'd you do?
...?
"s_r again, don."
"okay, the throttle's converging. looks nice. onfident"
"okay; i've got - i've got us - oh, i've got us about 3 seconds early."

are you ready to work?
i thought there were a couple of good rocks over there. there.
okay. ecs looks good.
okay. shouldn't be less than 0.3 in a minute.
...
"no, that - okay - -"
yes.
and bend over and i'll get your antenna up.
"aquarius, houston. dis you call?"
"we won't have any trouble nagivating without that navigation system, but it's just keeping them posted to where we are."
roger.
"no, it doesn't lock. they don't lock."
"... a little bit. i'm not closing you out, john. i'm just - get some bending room here."
"okay, dave. that sounds like a good idea. we'd like a frame count from you before you leave - -"
"yes, please, al."
okay. see you tomorrow. _ank you for every- thing.

"meanwhile, fred, i've got two for you on the lm prep checklist."
roger. we saw you looking at regulus there; we didn't realize you were looking at the earth instead.
you already shot up a roll of black and white?
"actually, on j-3, i took four marks on a crater that was to the west of j-3 and then i finally saw j-3 and started marking on it."
"pan camera power is off. 02 12 02 }_2 cc 15, houston. you can proceed with the rest of that procedure."
"okay. what - what we use as a reference is the entry stowage map, spacecraft ll2, 26 july 71, which is in the front of our flight plan. and, if you have that in front of you, why, i'll just go through that and give you the additions, dele- tions, and changes, of which there are very few."
"ah so. well, i put some new sensors on this morning before we got suited. when i get my suit off, i'll check it."
"i'll wait until you for sure get a good high gain on them; otherwise, we'll screw that thing up. okay?"
"okay. you go ahead ... 07 07 54 44 _p-lm jim, we got 5 minutes away from the ... look okay?"
i'll put it right there.
"yes, i got them."
"yeah, that's probably what it was, 8, 9, l0 - yep, there's a cyclic accumulator; hmm. okay."
"okay, casper. we copied, and you can go ahead."
"copy that, l0 echo, and boulder east of which geophone?"
so it doesn't screw it up.
"- - valve back there for me, dave, while you're there."
"take five shots, it says. 05 22 52 37 lnep okay, i go_ ..."

"roger, 17. you're go."
forty k.
okay.
"roger. we'd like to put a line in between ""read plss 02 quantity"" and the note."
roger.
"i'm not sure we got - we got a bag left, john?"
roger. as we suspected.
"*** wipe a couple of spots, so it might be - it's going to be tough to show this, pete. it's in the shadow. give it a go, though. i don't think the pictures are going to show you much, houston. because it's - well, we'll give it a go, but - -"
"that's correct, sir."
and that's a - -
that's affirmative. it is.
"okay, you want to take a picture of it first? okay, power ... okay, stand by. b, 2, 1 -"
here's one.
"obviously, it's on the side i can't see."
columbia is coming up on a verb 45 enter to reset (columbia) the surface flag.

"and, houston; kitty hawk."

"okay, stand by, joe .... 08 o1 07 b6 cmp houston, 15. i'm ready to copy the consumables, joe."
"no. that's - that's fine with us. 05 08 28 0s cmp okay. i've got my tone booster hooked up. and if you want me, send a crew alert and i'll come talk to you."

(humming)
"that's affirm. that's why we want scb-4 put in the - or dumped into the thing. but it's a dirty bag, so we just want to dump the samples in."
"orion, aft omni."
okay. it looks on the map like it's about 75 meters in diameter. fairly subtle.

"jim, could we - -"
"yes. we should have raised the flag on this thing. it looks just the same as when i left it, but i thought i moved it."
"no, i hadn't heard that."
you got your checklist there?
thanks.
"hey, that's just fantastic. i never saw one in the simulator like that."
"yeah, i got the hammer. when it's this loose, the stuff is lying up there on the top."
it's usually easier when you do it yourself. the angle 's wrong.
that the same as i had before?
"bmag, three, to 1/2."
got it. got it; 185 and 1.5 and i'm going to head on at about 012. we ought to go right through jones. *** davy jones.
maybe we can get a chance to get up another sample ###
"cross-sun is pretty good, you know?"
... regular ... heartbeat.
"that pocket open, buzz? 04 13 36 35 lmm' yes, it is. it's not up against your suit though. hit it back once more. more toward the inside. okay. that's good."
"well, i'm going to take what dust i got in with me. oh '"
mine reads 3.7.
"okay. the n'_nbers of these things - 06 05 10 06 lmm-eva okay, the 0.2 almost went in all the way. 06 05 10 t0 cc okay, charlie. we see that."
that sure looks tight. i guess i could switch to ...
"roger, ron. okay. stand by."
roger.
okay.
roger. which circuit breaker was that?
i know it.
yes.
how about - how about coming around from this side?
off.
"okay. the hoses are hooked back up, tony. you should see some decrease in the separator."
open the crossfeed.
yes. i dropped one.
roger. copy. that sounds kind of like it didn't work out too well.
"i need some more cable there, charlie."
"okay, houston on the - the craters is to the north of the wright brothers. the slope of the walls is steep - probably 45 degrees on the inside - it's a gradual slope on the outside sllp- ping away from the crater. there is no apparent albedo differences in the ejecta or patterned an- nulus around the crater itself and we're looking specifically at the one to the northwest of the wright brothers, now. there is a definite mare flow that is unindated [sic], and it's a different color and, you know, that you have a light albedo to it now, it's kind of a grayish tan. it's a light grayish tan material that has flowed - and i can't tell - it almost looks like it's flowed down to the crater. there is an impact crater right in the breach of the crater - which has nothing to do with the flow itself. the material in the - i'm almost out of sight of it already. i was going to say the material in the inner crater in these boulder ring structures down there - the materi_l all the way in the center of it is comparable to the h-mmocky, bumpy looking type stuff that is not really the mare - not the smooth mare of smythli - but the other part of the mare of smythii."
"yes, i'm positive it's aligned. it just - it didn't appear to lock over, well not appear, it just won't lock over. i'm shoving it home. okay, i got it."
copy 472 on that. you mean the south half of the split boulder? i24p-eva yes. *** seen inclusions in the other half.
"0k_y, tony; go ahead."
hang onto this - ... that's going in charlie's s*b.
"go ahead, 15."
"all righty. okay, i'm heading down, jim."
huh?
okay. thank you.
"see what they mean by sculptured hills, gene? see the knobby characteristics in that - -"
"okay, bob, i'm off, but i'll get them for you. i'm sorry. i look at them, and they all look good to me. and it - you know. i keep forgetting to give them to you."
"okay. -- separate, simultaneous communications link in use between cc and cm"
i'm going to put it in your bag.
all set?
"super down here, dave and jim. from what i heard, it was not only a good landing, it was a great landing. and it sounds like you didn't even bend i anything."
"re always used to make me sit at the console through the back-side passes, just for training."
"yes;,waste stowage vent valve, closed."
"let me get yours too. cdr-eya okay. okays there you go. okay, you've got a cap dispenser s you've got a rammer, and you've got - _ell_ i guess scb-8_ if i'm not mistaken."

i'm not sure we're going to be able to see the lm.

"okay, i'm going to have to move out here a ways, geno."
you'll be able to see everything we do.
"it's a split one up there, jack. i've had ntyeye on it. there's some big boulders down here."
"yes, we're ready for the power amplifier and the higtt bit rate, and normal voice, on the function switch, please."
you can't hardly sock it up (laughter).

"roger, columbia. did - how did tranquility look to you down there? over."
"okay, i tell you what. if you wait 6 minutes until after los to finish that, you'll leave the surgeon in suspense until you come around on aos. that 'll help keep him awake. okay, i'll see what i can do one way or the other. i24p not according to flight plan."
"gordo, going back at that burn. it was an out- standing burn. we were looking about a half a g throughout the burn. she lit off on time. she was a very steady burn. i think she reversed roll a - a couple of times in the dead band. the computer and the ems were with each other all the way. t"

"okay. i guess we had a - a weak period there. yes, we're ready for your read-out."
roger. we concur.
"hey, there's some bedrock on the bottom, i think, · here. looks like big boulders."
it'll be right underneath the groundtrack. it's right under it.

okay.
"thank you, joe. 06 17 19 b3 lmp-_ houston, this is hadley base. we're about to be off comm here for a short period."

"you have the - do you have the wrench in there, too, don't you?"
"some bright halos and dark ones. and the darker areas look like cayley, don't have as many bright craters on them, as a matter of fact. let's see, can i - yeah, there's one bright-rayed guy on - another cayley type. most of the cayley types seem to have dark craters - generally rimless. everything here is still - on the small scale, we have circular craters; on the large scale, we have crater chains and - and lineaments - they're on a very large scale. both ... certainly. 05 23 13 i1 cmp now, there's places out here in this cayley now where you find smooth areas that interweave with the - the more pitted areas. then these smoother ;<onr41b, -.ntlia da=6 bands seem to be just like these thin bands at ... then some of these bands seem to cross both the white and the cayley-looking materials. now then, here comes - this must be mandel'shtam that i'm coming up on now."
"okay. on the right side of the card, in the mid- _ dle, after comm. these are all add-ons. there's about six line items of add-on under there, which we have fit on our card. you'll have to start up above that column to do it. first is ""s-band mod pm."" 05 l0 28 47 iaip-i_m okay, keep reading them."
"okay. let me talk to you about rover status. the additional distance - this 0.6 - will - and your new position - will not affect the electrical power profile. it's really a very small and almost trivial distance. and, secondly, the lm slope, the 9 degrees by 9 degrees, is within the angles for which the deployment is specified, which is 15 degrees, and also within the angles for which it's been tested. and i guess a couple of days ago they did test 15 degrees of pitch and 5 degrees of roll at marshall, and 14 degrees of pitch and 14 degrees of roll. and, right now, we will, in real time, have the moekup at marshall positioned corresponding to our pitchup of 9 and roll of 6 degrees. over. 04 20 34 37 cdr-i_ okay. that's nice to hear, and it sounds like those fellows are planning ahead as usual."
all right. i just pulled the pin.
"roger. somebody on the ground here hasn't seen it, apparently."
we might be able to fix that in the cockpit. lmm-eva yes.
jolly good. we'll try to please.
roger.

anyone else have a jumney [?] bag they want dumped?
*** film?
"good idea. say, i've noticed when you get started moving down that way, it's sometimes hard to stop."
okay.
roger. we're following you to the surface check- list.
"it might have been a window in the plains here, of some kind. but - it's strange to see it there, with so much subfloor all around it that we saw."

and any sort of outcrop you see in the south massif.
"this is a gross admission, if that's the case; but i'd rather have it that way."
"mark. oh, i should have proed. thattll be 190:21."
yaw was 11.... sps midcourse.

move it up a little.
"well, that's our recommendation anyway. and can you tell us who plans to sensor up tonight, dave. -"
"yeah, it really is."
okay. in work.
okay; you get that u.. finished?
"roger. we need to tweak up your pipas a little biv more, dave, before tp_v."
"okay, don. they're on their way into the l_ now. and charlie's in there and john's joining him, and i'll work on getting the tv camera out."
"turn around to your right, would be better."
let me have the cable right there.
you on the right antenna?
"question number 12 for dave and jim. you - you didn't have time to get to north complex, craters which m_y have been formed volcanically and where you thought some surprises might be found. was this a significant loss?"

"okay, what we want to do is see if - this was triggered off by your observation of orange mate- rial last rev, i guess, and possibly earlier. but the idea here is to look for some craters that we've identified on photographs that are in similar geologic setting to shorty crater and see if we can see orange material around them. we're trying to determine if the orange material at shorty is a one-time special occasion or whether possibly it's common to the area and just never been noticed before. and we think you'll be able to determine this visually, better than any other way. so, if you can get out the orbit - the orbit charts; the orbit photographs; let's see, the lunar landmark maps for the csm, and turn to the landing site number 2 or 4 piczure. let me know when you get that, and i'll show you where we think a likely point is to see craters that are similar in settin_ to shorty, to look for orange material. 08 20 51 31 _mp okay, gordy, we'll do that. i've made a co_le passes with the binoculars over the dark mantle aro'_nd littrow already_ and have seen nothing com- parable with what's around sulpicius; but lefts have zhe exaz_ples, and we'll make a s_ecial effort on it."

"that's main a, battery c, charlie."
i think it is. affirm.
"roger. understand, neil. next topic, as - just after landing, you pointed out that there was a hill to the west along the plus-z axis from the lm. are there any large rocks in that direction that might block the solar ray during the sunset - as sunset approaches in your local- ity - are there any large rocks that might tend to obscure the ray? over."
"okay, geno, i don't think you need to copy this. sort of just - ad-lib it. with your four chrono- paque maps, tape two maps and allow about a 1-inch overlap to a 15-inch by 10-1/2-inch configuration. that's an estimate. and then repeat with two other maps, and then tape both the two maps - now four maps - tape them together, and you'll end up with a sheet that's about 15 inches by 19 inches, a sheet of chronopaque. and then tape both sides of it - the overlapping edges to strengthen it. and you can further strengthen it, if you tape an ""x"" of tape across both sides of it. and then, on the roll up, on the long axis, and secure it with a strip of tape and put it in the etb. and on that strip of tape you secure it with - be sure and leave a tab on the end of it so you can get it off with your gloves. and then remove clamps from both the utility light units, and open the clamp jaws to max. and then tighten the mounting bracket that you've got on it so it will be swing- ing around; and stow the clamps in the etb. you got that, gene?"
okay. just a minute. hunch. got it.

"roger. h2 tank 2 fans, off."
"ken, the surgeon says he can't tell which - which one of the sensors is dead, so before we take off here and do them all, why don't you try pressing down on them and let him - let him watch his data - maybe we can find out which one is the dead one. press them one at a time."
"go to - ptt, main right, verify. then it should go to b and you get a tone."
that' s affirm.

"okay. my mistake is putting all this junk in this pocket, but this is the obvious pocket to put the goody."
i think we have enough rocks from the south ray.

okay. you want to put that in?
"that's affirmative. just bat 6, jack. and the next line, you had battery i and 3. make that battery l, 2, 3, and 4. just add bats 2 and h° all four descent bats. and then the next two lines about waiting 30 minutes, cross that out. and the next line about batteries 2 and 4 off/ reset, cross that out, too."
"how do you read the lmp now, ron?"
it's not that hard.
"okay. and bring it back upstairs. 04 16 35 36 _ okay. the volts, 35.0; amps, 2.4."

they're closed.

"yeah. i - i kind of feel like if we're ever going to be able to sort this out, north ray's probably the place. personally, to be able to get down 200 meters is something we probably ought to do to - to see just how complicated this thing really is."
"say again, charlie."
"yes, let's put the sesc someplace - let's put the sesc someplace where it's accessible to get that cont_nination sample. we probably want to get it before you go off to the _t_qep, but there's no real hurry on that. we'll see what works in best. i'm not sure where the most convenient place for you - -"

"okay, equalization valve's coming open."
okay. sounds like that was a good exercise then.
"i'll bring them up separate, charlie. you want me to reset the uv before i go up this time?"
don't scare it.
"throttle control, auto."
"as soon as he starts trying to talk, the signal strength drops off about 0.4. now, i have had - i heard him loud and clear one time when he called you guys."
roger.
okay. if you can get back there.
"hello, tranquility base. houston. we copy the noun 93. you can torque them. over."

roger. t plus 3:30 vice t plus 6:30.
okay.
roger.
"eagle, houston. have you initialized the ags yet? over. 04 03 06 17 i_mp negative. i haven't had a state vector yet."
"now, you want me to get the isa - you want me to get 100-foot tether out of there?"
okay.
"okay. so that gives us a good platform. now the lm will maneuver to the jettison attitude, and the only thing of significance here is that you want to watch to make sure that the path they choose to go to the jettison attitude avoids gimbal lock on your own platform."
"you have mode iv, jim."
go ahead.
"yes, siree-bob. hey, look at that big mound over here, son of a gun. hey, hey, check the mound ... over here."
"okay ... let's see; we've sealed the organic thing, removed the saddlebags; we scooped material; we stowed the src; we stowed the core tube; we closed the src; we got an _u check, comm check - hello, houston. how do you read? ... bolt on."
okay.
close .... up ....
... told me ...
"oh, jolly good, there. i - i've got a couple or three changes to your checklist and your cue card, if you want to fish those out."
"okay. in that case, i guess you're free to come home °"
roger. a p52 and then the sleep attitude.
"okay, copy that."
"no, there's pdi 11, right there."
i'll write the get down.
let's go around to the other side and not kick any dirt on it. it ruins it.
okay.
is that right?
"and, you've got it."
"yes, that's my presumption. i kind of thought the daytime people would have taken care of that. it's not the best time in the morning to call up right now. i'll make sure overmeyer calls in the morning and checks on it."
and i'm not going to brake it to amount to anything.
"hl, houston. we do have a few items for you here, entry pad's, consumables, and so forth. ttfter you've had a chance to get organized, _enever you're ready to start on a few of thes_ :terns, why, we'll resd them up to you. over."
he closed it.
"okay, let's do it."
"that's a point. okay, joe. do you need any read- outs from the lrv?"
if we can get it open.
"let me know when you turn them on. i only need about 5 percent; i don't need much. 00 00 _0 13 cdr okay. coming on. ii )nfid, l"
"oh, yes. i didn't take a pan. why don't you turn right to a ...?"

okay; mine are stowed.
"15-d, al."
"houston, copy. good show. that was some p52, jack."
okay. disconnect your lm 02 hoses. 04 17 53 26 lmlp-lm okay. lm 02 hoses are disconnected.
now. dave. we've got the changes to the flight plan here if your recording secretary is standing by to copy it.
"okay, jim. no problem."
"okay; let's see. we're in auto, so we can ***teen. 26 on the dial"
"okay. i can proceed with em_ check, can't i, joe?"
"okay, that's about an hour and 20, then right?"
"okay, bob, i'm breaking down the core at the tail end of the rover, here."
"yeah, i believe in computers, too."
"just trying to get some words in, eh jack?"
"geno, we'll have fao work on a good time in the flight plan later here to work in a captain's mast."

"okay. the pan's complete here, joe."
"it's breakfast, day 7 meal a."
we've got 10 wet packs.
"all right. our understanding on the mission timer is that, even though you tried to reset it, it still refused to count up. is that correct?"
okay.
i don't think we're going to have any choice.
"yes, you're right."
"go ahead, houston. say it again - go aheaa, america. c>_ (laughter) okay, we've got the cor_z_ander'smenu for yesterday."
main a? here we go; one.
the switch can't produce an ignition signal without something else producing the ignition signal. it sounds to me like the light circuit breaker switch.
"16, houston. when you get around to - prior to suit donning, we recommend that you lubricate those wrist rings using the maintenance kit that's stored in a-8. and you might try to work some of that lube in around the locking rings and work the ring several times to try to free them up a little bit - the locking rings."
"okay, let's get ready to roll."
and there are some that are up to a couple of feet that require some maueuvering.
atca (pgns). come on. let's take it easy now.
what do you need here?
"they're not in now because i'm lining them up. just a damn minute. now, they are all the way in."

"challenger, it's - your computer. you have a state vector, a time increment, and an rls."
"15, houston. we'd like to have you turn 02 heaters i and 2 off at this time and leave number 3 on auto."
what do you need?
"okay, jack. just like always."
"apollo 16, houston. when you get a break there, i do have a few flight plan changes i'd like to get up."
"okay. endeavour, how do you read the falcon?"
"hey, charlie, could we have you check your uplink squelch. is that off?"

"okay, joe. the lm/cm delta-p is a plus .7."

okay. i was just wondering about whether you could recognize whether you're on a ray by albedo as well as the boulder content.
"challenger, houston. words on the radar. w_len you parked it there, we saw it go to the proper places. from all our indications, the interface between the radar and the pgns is okay. and our best guess is some kind of self-test problem."
"okay. that's verify the main bus voltage, and switch lm power to csm."
"stand by, mike."
buster is a real impressive crater.

"joe, i just took a - quick look with the hand lens at that large rock i brought in, and i'll - i don't think there's much more than 30 percent plagioclase. i'll go back - could be more of a standard basalt or gabbro. it has a fair propor- tion of ilmenite in it, i believe. there's a bright platelets - in the vugs or vesicles - of ilmenite. now it could be that the glass - if the soil is very glassy, that it's developed the darker color from the contribution of the - of the basic minerals through the glass, particularly the iron and the titanium."

let's see. we're pretty much straight down on this one.
"okay. here, unplug this."
"descent vent, fire. okay -"
"hey, al, ... work out here all day. just take your time."
"hello, houston. you want those 02 tank heaters pulled on?"
"okay. at this point, we want to delete the verb 49 to the 52 - the p52 attitude. we're deleting the p52; it's not required. at this time, we would like you to go to p20, option 5, plus-x sim bay. 04 07 56 18 cml° okay. following the completion of the tracking, we'll go to p20 option 5 and plus-x. i presently have emi°509 running, and i will terminate it following the p24."
"bob, to me the sculptured hills incorporate the albedo, both of the north massif, or the massif and the mantle area and combine them to give you a generally in-between gray albedo, but the sculp- turing is produced by the darker albedo that looks like the mantle, and the lighter albedo that looks like the massif."
okay.
"here's something - okay. if you could take a camera. here's something, you know, we never check in any of the bench checks - that was this 10-millimeter lens won't stay in the - in the cushion. it just floats right on out."
"yes, it (laughter) it's tightening up again, joe, and i'm not putting any force on it all. it pulls itself down in, and then it starts to bind up."
"yes. let's see now, jim, there's one more read- ing there; you gave me the - you gave me the helium pressure 4100. what's the manifold pressure on that one?"
"yeah. but it didn't seem to be as rough, is what i thought. okay. we're at 348 at 0.8 now, tony. still in indurated secondaries."
yourre not triggering. are you reading me okay? *** your vox isn't coming through at all.
did you turn the descent water off?
"what? i - i can't remember it either. let me do the orange one, though. i'll rig this and you just go over - i don't know whether it sits on ... this one or the side one, i never can remember, but i'll fix this where it works. okay, that goes there and this color tv one goes - orange to orange. now, that should be pretty close; but, when you stick it over there, you may find out it needs to be on that bracket. i'm not for sure which. okay? and take this with you and put it right by - in the tsb. good."
okay; good.
"okay. i've gone to number - sequence to number 9, and i'm stowing this beauty."

"question number 9 for dave scott. in view of your comment to geologist leon silver about the need for trained scientists on the moon, do you think that scientist-astronaut jack schmitt should be included in the crew of apollo 17, the last of the apollos ?"
ail righty.
that would give you an attitude 202?
"okay, houston. the gimbal motors are on."
"yes, i'd be all squared away if - if the moon were on jack's side, because he's got that end on his head, but i'm a little mixed up now."

"go ahead, charlie."
"okay. we're about to wind it down, ken. only two things i have for you is to go over the rendez- vous procedures and i'll let you get on through your presleep checklist and - and wipe it out for the day."

"- - because i just scraped bottom on the lcru. if it's still working, i'm glad to hear that."
yep.
"go ahead, aquarius."

y_erica's ticker is doing fine - along wivh everything else.
"i didn't write down the a0s time, did you?"
"al, i'll have an answer for you in just a minute on that. in the meantime, could you reverify that the covers on the x-ray and alpha particle are open, and we're getting some problems on that, and i guess the best thing to do would be - to just go to your checklist, page 1-33, and do that cover, open, couple of steps - which is listed ""n_mber l, cover, open"" - -"

"did you? and then it - when we pitched over, i could see the descent stage like you said."
"any time, bob."
"hey, can i get a - a tv ...?"
"roger, al."
go.
"2800 feet. 04 04 44 21 65ip well, we must be going in the right direction, then."
okay.
okay. we are going to skip the e-mod dump for right now and get the uplink in.
"okay, i can look back around the corner now and i can - i can see where the east - where trident 1 rose up to its rim on the east side, and i would say we're abeam of a point - abeam of a point one-third the way from east to west up the center of trident; that is, we're - we've covered one- third of trident i and we're abeam of a point of a line that goes through the one-third point from east to west of trident 1."
okay. we've started our photo strip.
stand by.
"ah, here it is. 04 22 45 22 lmi°-lm that could be the ... flash gordon with those - with those ... on."
"*** 04 22 23 29 i2,e_ stand up again. there you go, it's ***"
"houston, 15. go."
okay. great memory there.
"mdc guard, al."
"roger. go ahead, dave. thank you."
"stand by, gor - stand by, jack."
"let me get down here, and get a shoulder under it."
roger. negative on the read-outs and standing by for tv.
"okay. down about - a few lines down where it says, ""load meed attitude - that attitude now is 071,.051, 039."
"no. no, sir, bob. i'm still getting dusted. we're trying to go over this thing pretty thoroughly."
0key-dokey. i'll cycle the main shutoff valve.
"okay, jim. i got command module 356.65, 163.42, 346.67. aquarius, 302.26, 345.92, 011.78."
i am on forward omni. i've been on forward omni.
i can piece them into my flight line stereo.
all right. should i put the lr cubed right about here?
"that big one. let me - - 06 21 38 58 ii,p-eva just this side of the gnomon."
"orion, this is houston. read you loud and clear."
"... i can't - close and lock forward hatch, huh? lmp-_ yes. can you do it?"
(laughter) okay. sorry about that.
"yes, that's firm. we got a good hatch integrity check, but - i guess what i'm thinking is there's - you know, there could be something in the seal there. and perhaps the thing to do would be to repressurize the tunnel and pull the hatch down, and take a good close look at the seal and then stick it back in. it shouldn't take too long. 07 09 29 3b cc apollo 15, houston. that seems to be about the best conclusion we can come to down here, but we're - kind of like to go into a hold briefly. another indication is that we would - we are seeing the i2_cabin holding steady and not using any oxygen from the ascent tanks, which seems to say that we're not leaking into the tunuel from the lm. 07 09 bo 02 cdr okay, understand. 07 09 30 08 _ do we? 07 09 30 _4 cc 15, houston. we'd like to verify that the pressure _- equalization valve is closed. 07 09 30 5h cdr that's verified; it's closed and on the yellow strips."
"okay, 0.6 at 20 plus 09."
...
"*** you can't see into camelot, jack; that rim is - is camelot out in front of us. i24p yes, i - -"
"laser altimeter, off - and that's a verify; mappii_g camera, retract; x-ray, standby; mass spec i0n source off; mass spec experime_fs, standby. and there is a caution: wait 5 minutes before retract; mapping c/lmera/las]_ralti_ter cover, closed; alpha particle x-ray cover, closed; ga_lwa ray, retrack; mass spec, retrack: enable all jets. 06 23 33 37 cnlp okay, just a second and i'll read it back to you."
too big.
- - difference between a rock being identifiable mad not being identifiable is the level of training. that just says you guys were well trained.
gnomon is on the rover. the tge is on the rover.
"okay, pete. we're - we'll start maneuvering at 30, and we'll go to 174, 133, 032. angles on the high gain, minus 14 and 105 and the normal acquisition."
"okay, we're getting it; and i'm seeing evidence of it now."
"i wouldn't bet on that, charlie."
i'm ready.
"gee, it ought to be pretty well in there then, hadn't it?"
"oh, and i just won me a beer."
"yes, i am, karl. 01 lb 29 27 cc roger. on page l-l, down under ""power transfer and rcs heater activation."""
okay. say again the angles you'd like.
...
started it. picard x_ c}_ works better when you take the slide out.
"oh, i'm losing it."
good show.
okays' '
"stand by. i think 8 went in, either 4 or 6. no, excuse me; either 5 or 4."
"roger. ' 07 03 52 06 cc okay, falcon; houston. i have a mbfn tpi for you and some words. 07 03 52 16 i/_p-i_ go ahead. i'm ready to copy the tpi, ed."
"okay. you secure the rake, and i'll secure the tv, and we '11 get moving."
"apollo 15, houston."
"that's affirmed, jim. how do you read now?"
what?
(hummi ng)
"okay, i'll take this."
i'll let jack help you with that.
i want ...
"okay, ed. i didn't hear the solar wind called off there. did you get that one stowed?"
good show. we copy that.
stand by 1.
"and, joe, how do you read aquarius?"
"we verify that. at 46:115we had 82 percent and · apparently when he stirred the, the cryos, the sensor broke."
"america, houston. you need to go back to the pitch and yaw in the flight plan, and the present roll will be okay."
okay.
"okay, charlie."
"okay, the landmark tracking looked very good, john."
"okay. now, wait a minute."
"well, let's not set any more."
"well, i think ken is getting ready for a burn at 90 - in 40 minutes. ask him if he's ready and can support that"
ail right.
you've got it.
"say again the angles, though. (eagle )"
okay. and the i_mpwas 8 - .8 to .7.
"okay, bring her on back, pete."
"yep, that's right."
it's really there.
"okay. and that's somewhere hetween the p52 and aos, an}_here you want to stick it. 08 05 51 47 c?_ okay."
"houston, 17. 7 alfa is 0.6."
okay. can we go to tv?
"yes. they cross just south of the lower part of mexico, probably through central amerfca. that is the equatorial band which we assume to be the intertropical convergence zone. the ether band, which stands about 30 south, correet!_ appears to join the equator at the far left, cr just beyond the horizon on the left edge of earth, or at least it looks like it's going to join it. we don't have an explanation for that banding."

"roger. 02 12 58 14 ii_p wetve - okay, we've also completed, i guess in essence, all of page 8."
"gene, looking at our plot board, you're directly over the southern tip of africa or just slightly out in the indian ocean there, according to our plot board, which isn't exactly accurate all the time. but shortly you're going to start going backwards on the earth here and head back across the atlantic. that ought to be some sort of a first. you cross the atlantic twice, going from west to east, and then, now you're going to cross it going from east to west here shortly. all in a very short span of time."
the tv is all ready. 00 o1 24 31 irp yes. o0 01 24 34 cmp ...
"okay, let's snap it on."

"roger. we copy that, al."
okay.

"endeavour, this is houston. over."
"well, flow front, or - or i've hardly even, it's - let me see they're bright on the high side, as you're looking north. you know, they're - they're bright on the high side. i would presume they kind of run east and west."
...
"aquarius, houston."
"give me the cap. i'll put it on, dave."

we're maneuvering ....
"okay. attitude dead band, min; rate, low."
okay. we - the fender fix is working so far.

that's right.
"15, this is houston."
"joe, it was just a very subtle, little - maybe half-foot craters of the size of a 4-meter crater that showed up very well in the shadow."
that's firm. sounds like we got good comm on pri- mary s-band t/r and secondary power amp. i'm go- lng secondary s-band t/r and primary power amp. over. i got a lot of - -
"okay. and, orion, i've got block data and a note from the surgeon and a battery-management proce- dure at about 164 hours any time you're ready to copy."
okay.
"okay. beautiful. don't strain yourself there, charlie. 05 01 40 13 imp-eva i'm not. i think i better use the r - the jack."
off and barber pole.
"okay. and since you know our approximate attitude, how about just getting me something to find you on the dsky for a southerly plus x-direction."
"no, do you copy. i gave you 195:32:51 as the start time, instead of 31:38. did you copy that? c_ yes, i copied, i'm sorry. used to working in vox all the t_me and i forget to push the button."
roger. we believe you were looking a little too far to the west and south. over.
yes. and mine are good.
okay.
"okay, tony, the camera's not running this time. i'll fix it when we get down to 5. you won't miss much."

"no, that's probably a secondary slope - that's probably a big rock clot from -"
"it ain't gonna ever go out. 03 22 18 41 _ oh, that's right. you got to release. you're right. not until you do that, it won't go out. 1-11"

and get down - -
that 's affirm.
"okay. configure - step 10, ""configure circuit breakers per activation pages 3 and 4."""
yes. it kind of surprised us.
okay.
"okay. moving to 27:55. move delta-v test and null bias check up to 27:00. in other words, just move that line up. and coming up to 28:00 a little something for you, a1 --we're going to delete the crew exercise period. and at 28:00, add in midcourse column - mcc-houston column - uplink to csm, csm state vector and verb 66; update to csm sps test maneuver pad. and at 28:05, h2 purge line heaters, on; exit g&n ptc; and maneuver to pad burn attitude. have you copied so far? 01 01 49 26 i_mp yes, i copied everything to the mcc-h column. understand the h2 purge line heater, on; and exit ptc_ and maneuver to pad burn attitude at 28:05."
"sure, sure it would have worked, charlie. that's a good idea, too."
"any textural difference between the dark m:_nt]e in the site and the sulpicius c_allus formation, ron?"
okay.

"endeavour, you're looking good at los minus 60 sec- onds. configure the dse for us, please. and we see you've done that; thank you."
on which side of that antenna? lmp_eva it's - -
"al, pan camera stereo switch to stereo, please."

okay.
roger.
pro.
"right after we've opened the secs circuit breakers the:re, we want to write in ""battery compartment pressure check - systems test, 7-a. if off-scale high, open vent valve through entry."""
"yes, unless after high gate."
"okay. that sounds good, charlie."
"okay, give me a range and bearing, please."
can you reach ... there?
"and terminal direct 02. okay, i have that. 02 flow high."
okay. and let me ask you - -
"al, while we're waiting for that pan camera off cue, i've got a couple of photo pads - a couple of flight plan updates here for you, if you can copy them."
okay. it's 210/3.4. 102 sa7y
yes.
"it's been a long day, huh?"
and your cabin looks good. lm also looks good.

... 1. 38.
"okay. whoops, sorry. bob, a possibility here is that the - this upper 6 inches of gray material in here is the latest mantling in the area and the light-colored debris may be what's left over from the impact."

okay. don't fall into that ... excuse me.
okay. we're ready to go on command module pilot of the spaceship america and his ... menu.
"endeavour, this _s houstion with your high gain antenna angles; update."
now they're open and i will close them now.
"okay. use the surface camera at 1/250th, 4, 5.6, and 8. and i've been doing quite a bit of shoot- ing at covering two of those numbers in the range 5.6, and 8. i've also been shooting some at 11, so i'll just drop it down a little more. the moon is still so big and bright there that i got a feeling that the moon is probably up around the f/8 to f/ll range."

that's a cliche.
"ttca, both, to jets."

"well, we - we expect that, but we're remaining flexible."
"read you loud and clear, orion."
"well, we are all set up here, karl; and, if the nikon will do it, we'll get them."
"thank you, jim. copied."
copied all those.
"yeah, it's done."

"okay, tony. what are the nominal angles for lockon error and on this attitude?"
that fixed it.
yes; okay.
"houston, 15. i"
roger. i got a p22 _2_0 optics - auto optics pad for you.
"*** greenish hue to it, too, i don't - i'm making that up, maybe."
make it hard to close the box later on.
"roger. and for planning, about 191:06, we plan to start rea_ing up the [24 changes if we can get through these. at 19]:_6, _rom that msfn up-link black, delete the lopc target-load informa%ion there in the desired orient. 07 21 33 50 cmp' okay. that's deleted."
"okay, verify ecs caution, h20 sep component lights; try in a minute. okay; there they come. suit gas diverter, pull/egress; verify?"
ah - ah (laughter).
"okay. big connector, you know."
but we can do that inside.
roger. stand by. you are much better down link.
roger.
yes.
that's how you bend your tires.
"okay. the first extra is, and let me get the original question because this question says, qmore specifically on item 2,"" and item 2 says, 'fwere there any significant changes in the noise ¥ihration level during the single stage of powered flight?"" specifically, describe your observations during the early s-ii center engine out-off, and approximately 90 seconds prior to tli cut-off_ you reported a high vibration in the s-ivb. we'd like you to describe the buildup of this vibration and its behavior through cut- off. over."
"you hope, you hope?"
"13, houston. wonder if you could zoom in on that s-ivb for us a little bit?"
"that _,[u fal]s flat on his back."
got to have the high gain. 08 08 37 51 cnp (laughter) how can i come around with a po0? 08 08 37 56 _ ... 08 08 38 o0 _ can't believe that'll work yet.
".it's not a question of - _ere's that sample that was in it? 06 05 _2 38 lmp-eva there you go. the to_ just wasn't too closed. 06 05 h2 27 cdr-eva yeah. okay, i got the bag. no, wait a minute. ... do with the sample? there it goes. 06 05 42 5_ lmp-eva a_other sample."
okay. here we go.
careful.
"yes. all right, only difference between this burn and the other is we got 19 seconds' worth of ullage."
"apollo 11, houston. the color is better now. it's coming in. we could attempt a little bit better focus on it. there we go; it focuses a lot better now. we see the eagle coming right in on the lunar surface. over. that's very good now."
go ahead.
"how you doing up there, ron?"
"you're over in the area between guam and the carolines, then. you're saying it would be just about due west of the carolines, then."
"roger, al."

i could care less.
huh?
"okay. i think maybe you're right about window 4 possibly being the photography window. if i can get oriented right. i thought you - no. there you go. yes. it's all set, right here. and, gordy , i'm going to try to also shoot, if you'll let me, two pictures on kk of that depression - colorful depression we saw near sulpicius gallus, if i can see it. is that okay?"
roger. understand. trim the ags.... connection?
how 's that ?
"roger, karl. might as well get them now."
"okay, joe. starting with 33. 152:30:01, 15_:28:33, 156:27:05, 158:25:37, 160:2a:09. and what's our present rev?"
"roger, just saw you come up like thunder, and that's how we're coming up. just going away from it like - nothing."
okay. you've got po0 and data.
mark.
we're just letting it heat soak a little bit longer.
yeah. all right. i will when i get here. looks llke it's hung up on something there.
"what was i marking on, charlie? aoout an 18-kilometer line, or what?"
"dave and jim, this is houston. be advised we've got an eva update for you, which you can copy on- to the checklist if you want, or we can read it to you as you progress through the eva, and we can talk about that when you want to. over."
ken_ you're coming up on about 30 seconds to tca.
...
"okay. got somebody that would like to talk to you for just a minute. cm_ oh, yes. 07 11 07 04 nasa ron, this is jim fletcher. how are you?"
squelch is enabled.
okay.
"endeavour, houston. standing by. 04 08 12 03 i_ well, i wonder if they're finished with our comfuter."
"roger. next subject, did either of the solar panels on the pse touch the surface of the moon during deployment? over. ((i0',;t; ni,_i!1.) 'l','lp,_ 71t/_' . page 42/j 0}4 18 40 19 lmp i think that two corners did touch, since when it (tranq) was deployed, both of them didn't come out at the same time. it unfolded a little unevenly, and of course, the terrain that it was on was a little bit - not quite as level as it was - as i would like to have it. and i think that two corners did touch to about i inch - no, three-quarters to a half an inch deep; and maybe along the bottom, it might have been maybe 3 inches, leaving a small triangular coating on two of the corners; and i think these are on the western ones. over."
i hope so. yes. they'll just have to hold up the - the rocks until we're there.
what's the master alarm for?
"well, the trench is about a - - it was covering all the evidence of stratigraphy."
that 's nothing new.
okay. will do.
"actuator handle, unlatch."
beautiful. beautiful!
"okay. it says here. we've observed the use of p30 for long periods of time and this appears to be degrading the p20 attitude calculations during nar- row deadband c_mera activity. and this is causing a slight increase in rcs usage. if you want to use p30, they're recommending you follow the following procedures. and you won't be doing any of it to- night, obviously, and i think we'll come up and let you copy them down tomorrow. this is just, i guess, to acquaint you with the problem and let you think about it tonight while you're sleeping. the pro- cedures we're recommending, when you use p30, as are follows: one, reselect p20; that is, release p30 once every 30 minutes, and allow the computer to integrate its state-vector forward. this is about a 30-second dealy [sic]. and then, number 2, do not input a tig time of more than 30 minutes into the future, while you're in narrow dead band. does that make sense to you?"
it is.
it's locked.
... command module water.
yes.
some ride.
roger.
"well, you might take a look at me walking up. but i don't think i can get to the top. i just got to f- get a place i can get a pan from, right here. right in this little hole. okay, now i left the gnomon down there."
"i don't see - oh, it's a piece of glass, probably."
that's affirmative. tank 1 fan. _p okay. to on?
i can get it if i turn around here. i'll get it.
"okay. let me know when you get it. okay. the after. okay, why don't you get the 500, and i'll _· get the core. i"
"okay, charlie. if you're out of things to do there, why don't you goon out where john is and see if you can find an igneous or a hard breccia to put on top of that lpm. use his camera to doc_nent it."
that's right. 250 ... we'll probably write it down in here on ...
"wait, let me look; let me look. dps to tig; got to do that at 59 - descent. yes, go ahead."
"okay, jack. ready to copy."
(cough )
okay. we'll get on with that in just a minute as soon as we get the ... changed here.
...
there's secchi in sight.
go ahead.
auto.
attitude's good.
"what's the she tank down to now, jack?"
okay.
"oh, i'm sorry."
"okay, tony, we got a delta - i2_/cm delta-p of 0.8 - -"
"..., l:ebe, you probably read us loud and clear in the ... mode ... 01 23 37 !5 cmp ge ahead, houston, ... say again on all ... on the burn card."
"dave, we agree precisely with that down here. _e think - from your descriptions, that's exactly what we've been reading and that's why we want you to move to the west."
"five by, jim; sounds great."
sounds good.
"okay, bob. we have not had any for - quite some time, i think, since the last time we t-lked to you about them."
"okay, karl. i'm ready to copy the tei-4 pad. _- 03 04 42 48 cc roger. tei-4, sps/g&n; 40015; plus 0.59, plus 1.21; 087:12:40.06; plus 3121.1, minus 2074.0, minus 06h3.0; 182, 057, 329; the rest is na. ullage, 4 jets, 12 seconds, and this assumes burn undocked; and no doi; and the roll, pitch, and yaw angles assume landing site refsmmat. and that's all. f 03 04 44 39 lmp - - 6; plus 3121.1, minus 2074.0, minus 0643.0; 182, 057, 329; 4 jets, t2 seconds, assumes burn un- docked; and no doi; landing site refsmmat."
"okay. these are the water accumulators on 382, right?"
"the ones that i saw back in the aft end of the (tranq) spacecraft appeared to be a good bit darker; of course, viewed from the aft end, why, they did have the sun shining directly on them. it seemed as though the material had been baked somewhat and also scattered in a radially outward direction, but in that particular area, this feature didn't extend more than about 2, maybe 3 feet, from the skirt of the engine. over."
"15, we have your torquing angles."
okay. is that what you want to do or did you want to just go ahead and cut it tomorrow? it's no difference to us.
"it is really perfect. johr., you couldn't have picked a better rock."
"apollo 13, houston. the next thing we'd like you to do is to -"
"okay, and geno has got his null bias check for you."
okay. that's what we wanted to know.
"okay, joe. i guess one question we wanted to make sure of here was that the - on the msfn cue to close the pilot valve, is prior to going to ems mode, normal? in other words, we'll never get the ems - -"
"if you're at all worried about the flight plan, ..."
...
"okay. okay, my side is locked."
"yes, it's black."
okay .......
"well, when you're up here looking at where you are, it even looks lower_"
there will be a lot of ... there.
roger.
"roger. the t-start, 175:34:32; t-stop is good."
"oh, yes; i see it. _%_"
"okay, right 40."
beg your pardon?
31450.
sep is complete.
concur on that.
"*** you are, and i'll give you a zappereno *** are."
"roger. on our cm,.we're showing you at 39.11, and your current's about what you reported."
"arf, arf."
on. boy. you can feel them go on.
"oh, i guess - stand by. i guess maybe 2 or 3 hours. it was awful cold, and it wasn't very good sleep. 'l'ni""' ,qb/ ]':l?l' idll"
"it says - it should say on there, doesn't it?"
it's too dark.
"hey, you're looking at me with the big eye."
when do we close that?
"it looked a little coarser grained, but that's all."
why don't you reach it? it may be better if you could.
super.
"yeah, i hope not, charlie."
and standing by for a consumables.
"casper, houston. 05 23 25 37 cml° hello there."
"well, what _re we going to do about these gloves; we take them both ... suits, right?"
"okay, jack. copy that. thank you very much. incidentally, as your tracking gets better and better, the size of mcc-2 is getting lower and lower and figures to be somewhere between 20 and 30 feet per second now."
okay.
"and on meal c, scratch the romaine soup and the pecans, and add 1/2 tuna salad."
043o3.
how about that! we have you in a 65.2 by 54.6.
"i mean, southeast of these. 04 20 o1 51 i2qp i'm going so have to go due sou_z:h. 04 20 c1 55 cdp, okay, you can go by the right e:!.gecf that hacy. 04 20 01 >7 i2<p yes. o_ 20 ol 55 clr okay, very good. okay, we've g;:t a spot, hous_ n. we will proceed with the depioy_.._ent. 02 20 02 0k i2_'p we're not quite as far from thosle ccorainates as we thought we were."
"hey, charlie. i've got a message for you. con- solidated jack pines is way up."
"yes; those pressures won't change, because it's the same transducer. they didn't change."
ail those wires and things look normal up here.
"... okay, houston; aquarius. how do you read me?"
"boy, you bet you. and i know why we didn't do it. it was just as tough down there as it is here."
"but, really those trenches - those craters are giving us the same information. that there's a light-colored material underneath."
"houston, this is 15. the - pre-loi secondary glycol loop check looked good."
"yes, it's the comm. very bad, aren't i?"
c_py. minus 16 and 58.
"okay, ron, and did you get the high gain in the 2-1/2-degree deadband?"
"okay, we got about 4 frags in 349 - okay. it's 349. 07 01 29 _54 cc okay."
guess we should.
okay.
all right.
that's where it is. we're climbing.
"there it is. hello, earth. man, there's not much earth out there, i'll tell you that."
"ron, you have about 30 seconds now until t-start. cml° ah, hah. okay. 28:03, we'll start the clock."
"five times in how many hours is not too bad, charlie."
ail right.
"we need a bias reading if you want to use it again, gene."
"rc6er. a fey thin6s that we want you to activate here so put a icad on that water soilep. have five items, if you're read_,'to copy. 07 11 2!_ 23 lmp ¥,_lydon't you just read them ye me mhd i'll turn them on'?"
"okay; we copy. 06 02 18 51 i_mp-eva okay, let me - okay, let's get a little bit more of the white, john. that - that got most of it; it was just on the end of the scoop."
i got it.
"okay, mapping camera is working real well, except for that extension problem. we have a margin of 203 frames. the laser altimeter is still degrading. we're down to where we're getting about 70 percent of the good altitudes. thirty percent of the time, it's fouling up. the pan camera is overexposing the film, but we can process a great deal of that out. however, we will lose some resolution. we're 58 frames ahead on that. the mass spec is perking along real good, and no immediate evidence of purges or water drops in the data. and we got that retraction problem that you're aware of, where we will leave it out except for burns. and the gamma ray spectrometer is doing excellent work. we've got good peaks for thorium, silicon, and potassium. and the x-ray and alpha particle are nominal. ]'amt: lojo"
all right. let go of my feet.
"- - we don't have to worry about it, but - but i will anyway."
"yeah. we - we see them, and - go ahead and torque them. boy, that beauty's nice."
"okay. ""until lm/cm dei.ta-p equals 3.0."""
"okay, we copy."
"okay? 04 17 19 26 ia_ okay. plss fan, on. right vent flag - right vent flag, cleared."
"there it is, all zeros. did you call a noun 59?"
yes.
".., affirmative. the horizon is about two-thirds of the way up from the bottom of the tube. the flag is over near the left-hand corner of the field of view. and that little rise is sort of centered - -"
"say again, john?"
"oh, man; oh, man .... that first day i really was ..."
"17, houston. you're looking good, and the thrust is go."
"understand, al."
"howdy, jay."
"yes, but i didn't think we'd ever really quite get to that far corner. not 2, but this other one. and we're going to make it."
"see a preamps, and i see ecs, barely."
"target about l0 miles, it looks like."
okay; 1 and 2 to off and 3 to auto.
"i'm sorry, jack. i'1] have to ask you to repeat that."
yes. okay.
okay.
do you want this?
yes. it's all - very similar in color.
"and, al, we're going b data."
okay. it's setting there with 65 frames on it.
"everything's going to be p30 and, boy, we get out of here. turn the page over there and then you can see what the - see, we'll do the jettison burn and then we'll verb 49 to a new attitude so we don't zap the hot exhaust into the sim bay. and then we'll do a p41 for separation, see? at that new attitude. that's all over there in this thing. so, we'll do all that as soon as we separate, then we'll go into the preseparation - or as soon as we jettison, we'll go right to the pre-se? checklist."
there's just a little bit you want to go - -
shit.
"okay, you got noun - - · l day 7"
he was running in the 6os; the count's somewhere in the mid 60s.
"well, we're - gene's sort of headed for station 6 now."
"okay. we're in lunar align, houston, on the ags. let me know when you get to 68 and i'll write down ... - -"
"okay, ken. we'd like to check some switches up on panel 1."
"houston, 12."
"lm, 5103."
"roger, gordo."
"yeah, i think it's probably mylar. i think we got some gas ... trapped in those blankets maybe. 00 03 19 51 cml° john, is it worth dressing up the roll, do you think?"
we see the old lm.
"yes, that's at 192 - 192.87"
shutdown rule.
... for the cap co_'s sake.
i think there's a - -
okay. and scb 5 is one for the lmp if you want to take it off the gate. f
you mean on the surface? _
here we go.
"okay. copy that. and the next planned rover sample will be at a distance of 4.2; so, 080 and 4.2. and it will be in the light mantle if - -"
"okay, ken. keep going until the motor stops."
"yeah, loud and clear. where you been?"
"go ahead, jack. i - you're coming in very weak."
"i know, i'm just mulling it over, but there really isn't any way i could get them."
pull the - pull the antenna. i got to open it up to get it out.
"is that gonna be close enough, john?"
"roger, jim. at your leisure, we'd like for you to deploy the american flag, please."
"okay, now you got that clock counting up or down or something?"
"got your camera all ready, jim?"
"cabin repress valve - i haven't kicked them off. i think one of them was closed. okay. tunnel vent valve should still be off. okay, it 's 0ff."
"i mean, does it - -"
"those walking hinges are no longer any good anyway, after we get down to this point. okay, now sit down ... it's bouncing out."
"you can tell them we ran out, though. do you think this salad's good, al?"
is the s-ivb doing something different now?
"yes, if it's not flashing - -"
"oh, time; i'm sorry."
"hi, dave. you're coming through loud and clear. how did our consumables update get to you, okay?"
"roger, jim. could we start a pitch attitude down to see the landing site?"
"jack, we don't think so. it looks like you're pretty steady at between 5.5 and 5.6. we're watching it very closely, however. i_mp-lm okay, you know when we had that problem this morning, i hope i didn't - the backflow did not hurt something when i had the i_mp's hoses stowed in the isol valve and suit flow."
"okay, i copy that."
"and, dave and jim, let me give you some background on that. we've got several points that are in a very tight cluster around the first location we gave you. we think, however, because of boot- strapping a location from elbow crater backwards using the rover navigation system, we think that you may be mistaking last crater for index crater. and i want you to consider this as you look at your map and think about your present position. over."
"roger. and, falcon, your 047053 are okay. al, did you get the tpi and lift-off time for the direct ascent before los? over."
mark cmp.
"oh, yes, vance, very definitely. there are a couple of fault zones, through there, and you can - you can see the displacement quite clearly from the air. the one, the fault zone between waterman and tsiolkovsky, is a - is a lot more subtle, but i - but i'm quite sure that that's what's going on there. but the one on the west side is - is very clear. that 's - that 's true."
you okay?
"well, it's a sort of dynamic (laughter) situation that i don't think anybody was thinking about much."
think that to the south of us is spook?
"flight director wonders if you want to go drill a couple more holes? 06 05 17 b8 lmp-lm sounds like you turned them off, dave."
reverse the bank.
ken is watching it.... just give me the word they want to watch the middle gimbal angle.
thank you.
"that's affirmative, ken. you - you wait a little bit, it'll help, but stars 12 and 13 should be available."
can i get in now?
"is halo crater a shallow crater, houston?"
"aquarius, houston. go ahead."
"lineal word, i guess, is the - -"
"yes, they're in egress."
okay. the suit circuit is locked up at 4.5. *** 3.5 and holding.
"*** baby, there it comes. *** a psi. okay; it is increasing. you can go to cabin on the regulator."
yes. it really is.
yes.
"yeah, that might have been what you saw. it came pretty high in the air and went straight out to the west. look at that crater down there, would you?"
"okay, gene, you've got min dead band, att hold now ·"
i really think - i need ... - the only thing that you could really have ... is plastic ...
"okay. we got that. go to standby. open the cover and dust the radiator if it needs it. or dust the radiator, period."
hal there's definitely a dark albedo unit that comes down through here. i don't think i understand.
"okay, joe, you can go ahead and fire away at the lmp."
okay.
"roger, dave. and we've got that mark."
okay. have a nice night.
"okay. if that is a developing depression, it's approaching luzon and not very far away - 2 or 3 degrees of longitude now, although luzon is clear."
okay. it's off.
"*** change these numbers. *** an update on noun 76, did you? *** think so."
"you still got a picture, huh?"
"stand by. okay. bat c 37, pyro bat a 37, bat b 37, rcs a 51, b 63, c 62, d 58."
"roger. we're observing that, geno."
"gordy, i don't know what broke lock. did you read us all through ascent? we had some up-link signal strength."
go.
no mtvc.
oh.
"like driving a camel. 06 02 02 55 i/mp-eva yeah. and, tony, over on - smoky, it doesn't appear - i can see the lineations over there, but the - they are more widely spaced than - than on stone here and mostly parallel to the cayley. bear - bear left a little bit, john, if you can. there's a - okay, we're at 3. we can start looking for a place now."
yes.
"okay, orion. this is houston. i have the lifl- <off time for your p57. 07 05 21 23 cdr-lii okay. just a second, jim."
"if she goes into quarantine, it'll be a space first."
"thank you, joe."
"okay, we're at 3.15 miles, ken; 33 feet a second."
"okay, 338."
okay.
"you want me to put some fines in with this, dave?"
okay. is there anything wrong with taking it a little higher?
we're getting ready to go - do a p23. i - you trying to close it or open it?
"you'd never get here without this thing. hey. 06 00 41 21 i_-eva okay. joe wants scoops ef soil in - bag 6, huh? that the one on the back of the pallet - must be."
"(yawn) yeah. 09 2b 21 42 cmp hank, this one you want to do as a normal ptc, or do you want to use - - time skip l"
"man, with three guys in hare, hank, you just - when it comes time to eat, you just bring everything to a halt and go do that that's - because everything has to be done in the kitchen. you got to take your 52s and you got to do everything else right in one place. we'll grab something and we'll be pressing on here; we'll - wetll probably come pretty close to the schedule."
"apollo 15, apollo 15, that's a roger."
"being a big manual guy, huh?"
...
mm-hmm.
"okay, there's a big rock on - that i've already described. did you get the ... there, john."
roger.
roger. aos at carnarvon 2 plus 25 plus 50-
"oh, very good."
0kay; stand by 1.
"okay. crew status report, everybody's in good shape. no medication today. the onboard readouts: bat c, 37; pyro bat a, 37.2; b, b7.2; rcs a, 90; b, 89; c, 91; and d, 89. the fans are being cycled now. the water has been chlorinated. all the valves are closed. we're getting ready to pump up the cabin. and we'll give you a e-memory dump whenever you are ready."

*** same here.
roger.
copy that.
"and just for your information, your buddies on the surface are out walking around the rover right now on television."
"casper, houston. orion is stay for t-1."
"okay, we're going to try a configuration change here on your comm to save a little power trying to hold lo bit rate with an 85-foot dish and - which means select lo bit rate; voice, off; open the power amp circuit breaker; and wait about 4 minutes. and then return to the opposite con- figuration. do not touch the power amp switch, and you'll have no coremduring this period of 4 minutes. want me to go back through that slow? 05 l0 34 39 lmp-im yeah, could you run through it again slow?"
"okay. stand by 1. and you might be interested to know, we have had no problems whatsoever locking the yy strut on this flight."
and that happens to be hf number 1.
"could you get my gloves. i tell you, m_ fingers are so sore."
"hey, i'm pointing it at the front hatch now. everything seems to be in place down there."
"11, this is houston. the noise on the comm seems to have quieted down now. i guess that we've rotated a new antenna into view and probably also the earth out of view in your window. over. 0;_o0 37 17 lmp okay. it looks as though the length of the shadow of that cloud is about the s_mleas the width of th_'l'er:;i_m gulf'.

"and just to round out things as we pitch back into loi attitude, lo and behold from over the top of the lm came the earth."
"we originally put in a vector. we wanted to burn radially inward, and we put in a vector that was - would cause you to point radially outward on the calculations and then we just burned it to a larger number. so p40 wouldn't - wouldn't cause you to turn around and point 180 from where you were when you undock. d_ 06 28 58 cc roger; copy. _4 06 29 03 cmp do you have any reservations? )4 06 29 07 cc long as you get a foot toward the moon."
okay. ready? 04 22 53 32 cdh-lm yeah.
you got it on?
"i know. okay. 428, tony."
"go ahead, houston. 05 17 06 2h cc roger. we recommend that you perform this burn in ags, as you did the last midcourse m_maeuver; we think it will save gas. over."
"what do you mean, what the delta-v's we loaded? we loaded 45.3 feet per second. is that what you mean? that was our csi solution."
okay. these are the ones on page 3-149.
how about right here?
- - to look up there.
"and for emu status, i can give you about 36 percent, no flags, 3.85, and i'm on - i'm still intermediate cooling."
"that's correct, ken. and on the next page, 167:01, add ""laser altimeter, off; then p20, option 5, for 40 degrees south oblique; noun 78: plus 270.00, plus 087.75, plus 180.00."" and the noun 79 is 0.50; set high gain, pitch 10, yaw 350 for a0s acq."""
"okay, 16. we'd like to get the waste stowage vent valve, open, again now. 00 09 07 05 i24p and, pete, the lunar module looks very clean. there was very few particles in it, and that's just about it. over."
"okay. and then i'll read them to you whenever you get that in. 04 ll 27 55 _ okay, geno, i'm verified lock. how about yourself?"
"apollo 16, houston. we want to still keep working on this sps gaging problem. we'd like to get a readout if we could on your sps fuel and oxidizer pressures."
yes.
i got it. that's a big rock.
six - never mind.
why don't you put these in the mcdivitt bag?
"yes. i want to make sure i got it. 03 03 25 30 i//p oh, you strayed off?"
"houston, hadley base. we're all tucked in. we'll see you in the morning. 04 lb 58 06 cc falcon, houston. did you call?"
"okay, ed. cdr's at rain, ll; soft stop, 51; max, lo1."
i'm gonna get the control sample in.
"i think you can just leave it alone. it is holding some - during the maneuver and should hold until the end of it. ·lmp okay. the maneuver's over, gordy."
"we know there's a lot of scientists from a num- her of countries standing by to see the lunar samples, and we thought you'd be interested to see them as they really are here. these two boxes are the sample return container_'_. they - they're vacuum-packed containers that were closed in a vacuum on the lunar surface, sea]ed, and then brought inside the lm and put inside these fiber-glass bags, zippered, and resea},ed around the outside, and placed in these rece]_tacles in the side of the command module. thes_ are the two boxes. and as soon as we get onto the ship, (gos[_ nh""f 1) t,'lp,' _100/'4 i'm sure these boxes will immediately be t_'ans- ferred and delivery started to the lunar ieceiv- ing laboratory. these boxes include the samples of the various types of rock, the groundmass of the soil, the sand and silt, and the particle collector for the solar wind experiment, and the core tubes that took depth samples of the lunar surface."
"okay. and we need the fine count before departing b; and, right now, we're about 15 minutes behind in the time line."
"say when. 00 03 20 49 cml° yeah, ... get the camera started."
did the surgeon do a back flip on that one?
that's affirmative.

"and if there's any - if you - if there's no reason why not, we'd just as soon you go ahead and do the p52 now. finish that off and then start the maneuver. over. cml° okay. the big reason is that gene's getting into his suit right now."
okay. - ....
roger. copy that.
"yes. that's what it is, joe. i've got something going on this alarm ... ecs light."
"roger. we'd like to do a little chyo tank balancing. so, if you could position the oxygen tank number 1 heater switch to off and hydrogen tank 2 heater switch to off leaving all the rest of the cry0 switches the same, we'll let it run that way for a few hours. over."
"we can give you that, but it might get confusing."
yes.
"houston, 15. go ahead, joe."
"ah, very good thinking. and, geno, a question for you on the rover when you parked it. do you have any feeling for the roll angle it was parked at ,/ the i247 the roll angle?"
good readback. out.
"bob, that'll hold it down. i hope it solves the problem."
uh-oh.
okay.
you - you're right.
"okay. and so we'd like to go on to station 7, · then, when you get the 500 and the core, in hopes i of finding a variation of boulders along the front. _i"

"... 06 05 42 24 c_ - - i want to squeeze in here somewhere, and i'm not sure we're at the right place to do it. but i have yet to _ick up a star pattern in the tele- scope. and i'm going to take one of these back- side areas here and make a concerted effort to that."
"okay, 16. we are ready to - to back out. you pull that breaker?"
"and, endeavour; this is houston. you're coming up on 8 minutes to los. and we'll just go over the tei procedures c_ the next rev. no hurry on that at all."
mark. and this one is supposed to be at barber pole plus 4.
i'm just finding all sorts of good ways to make life easier out here.
that's good.
all right. go ahead. i'm ready for the tli pad.
"roger. you guys are just ahead of us there. we were trying to get that up to you. okay. no, i don't think there is anything here that really needs to be written down. i'll go through with you first, and we can talk about details and writing in, if you w_ut to on any of them. but, i don't think there is anything that really needs to be written in. the eva - it is going to be essentially nominal_ with two minor exoeptions. one is the - we've allowed about 5 minutes extra at the lm before leaving for the rover fender fix; and, john, we_il be talking to you _out that in a minute. _d the second big change, js that we're also extend - allowing 5 more minutes at the end of the eva so that we can have extra time for dusting. and i suspect that if the rover fender fix works and we aren't getting as dirty as we did last night, then we may gain back that 5 minutes. we're also allowed - well, what we've done is we've taken the time here out of some of the tasks at station 3 and station 4. and along with the fact that we think you're a little bit farther east than planned - and we're allowing 4 minutes additional driving time. but again, that's ali_ real timed and if we're doing well on time_ we can reinstitute all those tasks and get rid of the 5 minutes that we are allowing here, there, or elsewhere. so that's just sort of to keep in your thinking."
"okay, bob. i think i'm going to move a little bit to the northwest of my present position in order to get a little farther away from that big rock."
"oh, okay - -"
"no, i mean the rcs light."
"houston, antares. loud and clear. how me? 04'16 53 16 cc antares, this is houston. do you read? over."

"hey, it's off - it's off. they - they killed the bus completely now."
"subangular - very rough-textured surface. and the surface that's facing northwest - is the dark, typical breccia. and it looks like - what appeared to me - like there's a layer - there that might be a foot and a half, 2 feet thick, appears the - a light greenish color. dave's sampling right now."

and the frame count is 26. lmp frame is 26.
okay. real fine.
"okay, i'll go over near the rover and get one."
"and, houston; endeavour. there were a couple of questions on the flight plan. i guess i'm wonder- lng what we're going to do about the mass spec today. we've got some things in here. of course, we didn't use it last night. so there are, i guess, a few steps that you're to delete."
"okay, jack. won't be able to hear you."
"joe, there's so much dust on the camera that - by the way, jim, let me get your camera lens while we 're at it."
could you say that again?
"say again there, 17."
the mag - i did it. i'm sorry.
"no, do it yourself. it's running ..."
"you go to off and then back to zero, right?"
did you say something about terminating?
maybe i ought to get up there and do one ...
"rover, do you read houston?"
the best.
"try aft omni again, jack."
okay.
roger. copy that. sounds great.
oh; roger.
"and you might look there, houston, to see what circuit breakers aren't required, like the tape recorder."
and could you give us auto on the high gain?
"dave, you'll get a warning horn on - and you'll _ want to - over to your aux water shortly. just wanted t° advise you."
get these. i'm not sure it's - harry [?] wants pictures of stuff like that .... get one here of this - these guys right here in the bottom of this thing. that should be ...

one more pull and i'll give it to you.
"..., babe, ..."
"okay. as i have it here, starting at t minus 2 - -_ t minus 2 minutes, we close the main b pilot valve circuit breaker. at t minus 5 seconds, we pro. then, the delta-v thrust a and b switches both go to normal. at t plus 5 seconds, we close the main a pilot valve circuit breaker; and, at t plus 6 minutes, assuming nominal burns, we open the main a pilot valve circuit breaker; and, after that, we avoid pugs manipulation. and a reminder here is - don't forget to turn on the dse because we're vitally interested in that single-engine burn performance."
i'd like to get somebody to put into words to the big sim troop in the sky and tell him to let's make it a little more nominal from here on out.
"bob, 45 - 45 yankee is a sample - sample from near the sep. cdr-_va boy, i tell you, jack. that was all cut out."
"it's got the core tubes in it, so it probably goes on your back."

okay. direct 02 is coming open now.
"on your next pass, columbia, rather than per- forming a p22 as such, we would like you to look in the vicinity of the coordinates that we gave you, which is our best analysis based on map physics mid the trajectory, and we also have another set uf coordinates that we would like you to search in the vicinity of. this last one being based on allinterpretation of the geo- logiciel features that were seen by the crew on their way down. _le coordinates of this second site are ](ih._0.7 and 8.0. i say again, mike 0.7 and 8_ ). ! say again, mike 0.7 and 8.0. over. 04 11 11 08 c_fp roger. copy. mike 0.7 and 8.0. the only thing (col_.fi3ia is, my be:t tool for looking is the sextant and ir i'l;goths lo crank the sextant up, i msgh' as _o!1 iet n22 go at the same time, or don't o_ think sc:' 0h 11 11 24 cc roger. j f a jant to go that way, crank it up mad then _,ou can drive it a_ound and hook where _ou uz i]%. _% tl."

"just a second. i'm not sure about that. but it does appear to me as if the - the floor that the lm has landed on is indeed a different unit that sticks in, and it's more part of this cayley material that's farther out to the - to the west. and it does go back just about the way we had drawn the boundaries. say again your question?"
"houston, this is hadley. are you ready for the battery management?"
"how about another shot, charlie? more .... okay. ..."
"yes. we see that. okay. we'll have to be calling that up to you tomorrow as you go around, i guess. c_p oh, won't that - well, that'll be the same, because the idpc burn attitude should be the same as nominal."
okay. you have it. reacq and narrow. good signal strength.
"(laughter) you bet he has. okay. we've got the flight plan here, bob. which part of it are you talking about ...?"
okay. fine.
"we're getting some of that, ron. sounds like the mike might have slipped away from your mouth, though."
"roger. we were watching a few clouds in your area through the monocular along the texas gulf coast this afternoon, and we also noticed there were clouds over baja california, wl,_ch is a little bit unusual."

you do? the red against the - the star against a red background?
"gordo, we'll hang on the air here and we're going to finish up our presleep checklist and we'll just give you one final buzz before we go off on the voice switch."

yes.
"okay. water sep component light, on."
okay.
"jack, houston."
"gordy, i can specifically say that when those - after the bus stars came on, we called that out. i'm almost sure jack did get it, because i had him then check the helium valves and the nitrogen - helium and the nitrogen valves."
there's one open.
"yes, as a matter of fact. cc your last call about the helmet stowage bags. where - whereabouts in volume 3 is that?"
- - really know i've been out here today.
i think we can all find lalande now ....
"orion, this is houston. we want you to get the rendezvous radar and the tracking light off as soon as it's feasible, to conserve power."
"okay. pitch is minus 32, and yaw is 52. got it."
america here.
roger. we want you to dust and get in. we got 14 minutes remaining before we need the hatch clos ed.
"i could have guessed as much. and a question about the suspension, which sounds kind of exciting. did you ever notice it hitting bottom?"
"okay. you can brush that aside, and give me a call when you think that's cleared up the way it ought to be. that's probably one of those things we didn't think about when we decided to tilt the central station. t_i°-eva well, you didn't - you couldn't anticipate the soil, bob. it's very soft."

"gosh, there are some holes and rocks around here. who told me this was a flat landing site? cdr-i_! it is flat. for crying out loud. what do you want, an airtight guarantee?"
"okay, now, let's see, what's next? man, whoever put that velcro on there just didn't believe you'd want to use it. okay, back to the flight plan. see what i'm doing. okay, we got hartmann and green. let's see here; i concluded this one at - at 145. looks like i'm supposed to take two."
okay.
"odyssey, houston. the two circuit bre_ers you referred to, leave them in."
"okay, there's your verb 83 coming up."
"okay, gordy; they're all off. they're all off except bravo 2 and delta 2."
"okay. i've got to - that's an awful big depression over there, isn't it? says go along this way. cdreva boy, it sure is. wheel"
"okay, gordo. i took my comm carrier apart - or, you know, cut this little cloth covering that goes from the plug on up to the headset, what have you. and sure enough, there's two little broken wires in there; and the next one is a little bit - the next one to it is a little bit loose, also. but i found a little piece of metal, and i bent it to the - conform to the shape of the wire and i've got it taped up real tight right now. and i'm going to see if it works for a while - make sure it doesn't cut in or out, you know, or something like that."
"hey, gordy, as far as the food, medication, and sleep goes - no medication. gene had 5 hours of good sleep, i had probably around my usual 6, in spite of my poetic inclinations. and the food - we continued to do well, i believe. we've eaten a wet pack apiece last night. we got one this morning. we've eaten our scrambled eggs and sausage yesterday, and as we've run out of juices and tea. and which is somewhat of an inconvenience i might say. and if you've got any specific ques- tions, i can fill you in on it but, i think, food- wise we've done pretty well."
"hell, yes."
"how do you read, jim?"
okay. connect the lm 02 hoses. 04 22 42 38 _p okay.
"i guess my impression might be that some - at some places, we had some of each and - but most of it was from south ray. and around the lm, i'm - we saw - once we got going toward north ray, those - that material around the lm, by gosh, the breccia - and i collected several of thee at that last station- in hand specimens - some of them were like the material we got out of south ray, clear of south ray blanket, and - but several of them were from north ray. at least, that was my impression."
"here, jack_ can you see him good? check the set- tings there. i took an f/22 stop."

"well, shall we gently step along?"
"apollo 13, go ahead."
i'll do that right now.
"yes. okay, bob. we're still seeing - the l_ght- colored gabbroic rocks. i think the reason i said 50 percent was because in this light they look light-colored, and that's probably largely because of the zap pit halos."
you had some bad comm there; i understand you want us to go to block 6.
i missed that one. we didn't do that.

"okay. don't i do a suit integrity check, john?"
"we concur on that, ron."
"you know, the rocks that we were picking up at 5 and 6, that was a long time before station ll and - and i - -"
roger.
"okay, guys --"
jan said she's - you're the last person she would ever think would miss a meal up there.
"yeah, we want to know if we can do the plss comm checks. we just got a call to standby. it sounded like mike."
i don't either ... - - -
"oh, maybe i'm out the wrong window here."
- - jim. 265 - -
that's all i - that's all i need is a little more cord.
"roger. thank you, mike. could you give us some help? this ptc is strange: it's not like :my- thing we've seen before. we were wonderin_ if you have had any events or any odd data that could help us out. over."
okay. just whenever it's convenient for you.
that's the plug; they put them in there. just slide it out.
i'm trying to - -
"yes, man. i wish we could just sit down and play with the rocks for a while. look at these things! they're shiny, sparkly! look at all these babies here; goshl man!"
"oh, super clean. yes, sir. keep her clean."

"houston, orion. john and i have been talking about - if we get to land this thing, we'd like to - probably ought to think about going to sleep first and then we'd get up in a full eva tomorrow."
"yes, i am."
yes.
"looks like the walls are vertical. i'll admit the lighting exaggerates it, but that's how it looks."
tell jim lovell to practice digging (laughter).
"okay, orion. this is houston. we'd like you to open the primary power amp circuit breaker on 16."
"okay, we'll see you on the other side there, bob. j thank you."
"aquarius, houston."
"casper, houston. 05 03 39 02 _ hello there."
"okay; real good. well, just a reminder; may not be applicable if you've got a good dry cockpit there. on 16 we had some - rather strange read- ings on the evap out temperature and a few other ones. and the potential is there for you to get those same readings - especially if you had had moisture - the potential is to get those readings at - afl.er depress, and we'll be watching it closely. i guess - i don't want to say just ignore them, but we'll be watching them and take any readings for after depress there with a grain of salt. and while you're at it, you might go dowr_and zero the optics if you've got somebody in the leb."
"okay, joe. that chip off the old boulder there was 275. why don't you get this one. and i'll get - oh, man - seven bags. let me get a bag off of you there."
"okay, bob, i'm going saveral meters around to the east and towards the south to get this pan."
it's all weighed and stowed.

"what's that flitting out there in the breeze? are we venting again? take a look, jack."
...
"yes, i know it."
"roger; we copy that, charlie. _?_atwe're searching for on this direction of flow is if you think there's any - anything in the area that might cause it to stream out like some - a leaky zank or any- thing of that sort, or whether it just seems to be a.]most random."
yes.
"good morning, houston. anybody there?"
it looks close.
yes.
okay. that's the best place - that north overhang; and i guess that means one of you guys might grab the sec - the small can - before you leave the rover.
(laughter) okay. the going up here is bad news.
no. no.
"oh, it looks like we're coming down - have to go through a small valley - ..."
- - leave you a clean spacecraft.
"columbia, houston. doi p76 pad, if you're ready to copy. over."

did you knock your mode switch off? did i knock mine off?
okay.

this is a can cf worms.
isn't that something?

that's affirm. it's spitting particles off about five or 10 a second.
i can't believe it. it comes out so easy.
"okay, pan camera self test is going to self test. that makes barberpole. okays i forgot to time it, yes."
"we're on the move, bob."
"roger, understand."
"okay, houston. the sextant star check passes."
it's the first good concentration of large rocks that i've seen. very similar to the large rocks that - that 14 saw up at the top of cone.

"reading you loud and clear, houston. how us?"
okay. here's the darvon; we'll - -
"you had the right idea, but you did it the _ong way."
gee! i think one of the big things that impressed me was the - how instantaneous the decelerations were of each one of the boosters when they cut off. that included the s-iv tli cut-off. no physical appreciation of tailoff at all.
"apollo 15, houston. over."
"- - fresh little jobber-do's. now, wait a minute. i want to - -"
"there's no level - there's no level spot to park, here, though."

that's one thing we've had with us for 59 ...
and i don't fully understand that one. never have.
"good show, aquarius."

did you get a bunch of good marks?
okay.
"okay, the second one. the thermal cover is in to the second red mark. and, tony, the - the probe is out of the ground up to b-8 - right at between - right on the line between b-7 and b-8."
"gordo, we'll get those numbers out of the first state vector out of the computer here shortly. no hurry to do it though."
did hank tell you we got a couple of little casperellos flying along with us?
"houston, 16."
"and, 17 - -"
that's going to go in there.
"(laughter) yeah. that was a little tight. i went to a - to a - half degree per second, and we made it. seems like i had some things i needed to bring you up to speed on. let me see if i can find out where i wrote them down."

"fire. 05 02 i1 01 cdr-eva sound doesn't travel too good in a vacuum. i don't hear a thing, but it jumped. okay, charlie, i'm going to the next station now."
okay. i guess they can close it.
"say, bob, this is gene. i got some new sensors on. you might want to take a look at them."
okay.
okay.
might be a little dirty.
"not really. the texture is so different, it just doesn't look like as old a surface, but definitely different."
where's my mike? time skip
"on, talkback, lmp."
"*** standing in the shadow, charlie. get the after, charlie."
"go ahead, houston."
"okay. can you give me any - can you give me any cursory ideas of that, just the same - if there's any possibility i entered some%hing inadvertently? or does i5 take too long to sort all that out?"
"gordy, i'1.i try and take you across the terminasor_ if i can."
"al, there's no rush on it, but i'm waiting for your cue before i send up flight plan update."

stand by a minute.
"okay, we're heading on back to sep."
"thatts affirmative. okay. if you're ready to copy, i've got this rendezvous radar procedure. over."
that's affirm.
"huh? yeah, that's beautiful. i -"
"gene, there's one thing you may be interested in as - as the commander. we're going to have to do two burns tomorrow on america. the - the orbit - the mascons didn't deteriorate the orbit as much as everybody thought it was so there's going to be an rcs burn about an hour prior to the - to the lopc burn."
"okay, ken. we can see that input channel bit, and it's set, and it's staying set, so we think there's no need to proceed any further."
heading is 043.
"okay, i guess we'll - start getting back in then. i'm up below the camera right now."
okay. got it.
this is going to do it better anyhow. done it that way yesterday. how's that look?
did you take that down?
"understand, joe. uv photo pad, t-start, 196:56:19."
"yes, down in the floor, jack."
"once you're taped it you can stow the tape. un- stow from the left-hand temporary stowage bag, top pocket: purge valve, stow in eva bag, purge valve patch - pouch. and then the waist tethers, also. (humming) waist tethers are in that bag."

"okay. and on the flight plan update, we have five items, and there's no hurry to get them up there. whenever you're ready to take them and - and write th_ stuff down, i'll send them on up."
"roger. aquarius, houston. you're good right where you are."
"okay, the bu - bus voltages is hanging super - 28."
that's charlie's.
"you were really proud of yourself, huh? 00'02 07 15 lmp oh, it was great up to there (laughter). i got to go back - -"
"ail right, sir."
"okay, and, gene, you might get the - -"
roger.
"america, houston. i have a couple of flight plan updates to give you. we suggest you take them down before you start the p52, at your convenience. just so we don't interrupt your preparation for the zodiacal light."
okay. just going - -
... locked?
"go ahead, that's a boy."
"oh, i don't know. i think i'll make it up."
"it's delicious, jim, but it's better in your mouth than floating around the cockpit."
uh huh.
can you get this one too?
"and, fred, request pcm on lo bit rate, now."
"oh, okay. sounds reasonable."
"okay, map, pan, and sm/ac power should be off. i'll get them. you're in all of that junk - -"
okay; we've got those.
okay.
they're auto.

we should have aos.
no.
"that's affirmative, jack. i copy. you may not be reading me through the omni switch."
"okay, over the top. 08 23 51 01 cmzp it's coming over."
"oh, i didn't have to tell _hem tnat. they're listening. they heard ever}_ching airead_y this morning - a_ all _hree places."
okay. we're right on.
and a long way to go.
my -
"how do you read me, bob?"
"stand by, bob. which extension anomaly are you talking about, the one prior to rendezvous?"
i've got something like ...
there we go.
okay. that's just what we have.
yes. that's right.
"roger, jim, the read-outs. stand by. 0_ay, before we started the eal, they were minus 116, plus 052, minus 068. after the cal: minus 113, minus 064, minus 064. over."
"just something to think about. in about 30 minutes, we can generate the pads that we have yet to send up before the sleep period, so we could sup- port an earlier sleep period if you so desired. and - but, it will take us 30 minutes to get that stuff. the other thing is any time you're ready to copy, i can read up the solo book changes. over - and, also, two pages in the flight plan."
i know.
and i guess i'm pretty good on film.
- - but here's his rock.
- - h2 seconds.
"i'll say something. don't you worry. don't you worry, babe."
"i do owe you a consumables status yet, and - -"

"nine minutes, bob, and 17 is go."
"we had ours powered down completely for 2 days. when we brought it back up, the torquing angles were sometlling like - well, in coarse align, it doesn't - we put it - we parked it in gimbal lock. we didn't have any gyro drift updates or any pipa bias. that procedure really worked, john."
"well, i think that'll stay down, but it's not very good - -"
want me to get a picture of it on the right?
"... that little, looking for that little distance thing. here we go."
"yes. we understand, but it's all pretty much the same; the upslope is abcut - _ or 5 degrees, a,e tonfidenti ii day pockmarked by all types of craters. they're all old craters; but, nonetheless, they produce a very uneven surface. and i think we've found a spit here as reasonable as we'll find an_-_here."
"okay s _hat's the time? four minutes, please."
"roger. for your ags address 224, plus 60267; 225, plus 58148; 226_ plus 70312; 227, minus 50031. over. (goss net 1) tape 63/8 0)402 48 35 ia_p roger. 224, plus 60267, 225, plus 58148; 226, plus 70312; 227, minus 50031. over."

"okay, tony. i'm going to get a couple of grab samples out here in front of the rover about 15 feet. look like typical rocks that are in this area. one of them - they're mostly dust covered here, but i can pick up a couple that are whitish, and i'll get a couple of cross-suns before."
i'll get out of here.

...
"yes, sir."
okay. we copy.
okay.
almost looks like black soil.
"okay, dave, and just plug it on to your camera at your convenience. you'll want to change the ex- posure time to i over 125, and you might call out the filter position."
okay. get a little momentum going.
"well, i'm trying - i'm trying to get the - the upper portion there. there we go. 06 21 51 0_ lmp-eva the first 2 centimeters, bag _83. the next 5 - ahhh - in 48_. aughi"
"okay, endeavour; houston. computer is yours, and you can start your maneuver."
"stand by. okay, falcon. we're ready. 06 18 08 38 i_p-lm okay, in work. f 06 18 08 49 lmp-lm ed batteries both check at 37."
...
that's right.
"okay, did you get - -"
"aquarius, delete the dap set, gimbal/throttle test. just ensure that the deca power and the deca gimbal are closed."
"okay, jack. it'll be a few minutes yet. we want to get it right up to speed. tat_e94/1:?"
"hank, you asked me earlier about the configuration of the dse switches. was there some problem in the last time i reconfigured?"
"roger, john. we copy that."
"we went up in the tunnel checking the roll angle, charlie, and it's 2.05 degrees."
okay. i'm up to 10 minutes - three more.
"okay. you should have him now, houston. (columbia) 04 06 bk 16 cc eagle, we've got you now. it's looking good. over."
"okay, i'm out - almost."
...
okay.
"yes, bob, i think that's pretty safe, right now. once again, i'm surprised that it's _ coarse as it is, that being the upper portion of a plains unit."
"okay, falcon. we're reading you well now. give us hi bit rate, please."
... in.
"no, that's fine, john. i don't believe i could get it all in the field of view if you were any closer."
...
"that's a real great day, guys. i really enjoyed it."
this is on 9-4.
"we're a little behind. we're at 25. t o1 08 3b 03 cdr uv. by golly. you got to hustle, man. i'll be getting some of that stuff out for you."
"eagle, houston. would you please have columbia put in command reset? over."
okay. that's fine.
"yes, but how are you going to keep all that stuff out there clean."
what?
that's in bag 522.
".. 10 08 23 1_ cdr that's right, that's ..."
"okay. in other words, we're going to wake up twice tonight already, huh? 04 i1 22 05 cc yeah, probably. the first one should go off be- fore you get to bed, though. but that second one will probably come on before - just before you should wake up."
roger; understand. we're getting another one for you for 5 minutes from now.
"don't need any extra electronics_, but we sure could use another cloth hat (laughter)."
...
... pag8e6 ! confidenti/ t.:
"okay; 710 feet, closing at 2 feet a second, rates essentially nulled. 04 05 08 h2 cm_ did you copy that, houston? the range is 710 feet, 2 feet per second, rates nulled. houston, did you copy casper?"
"yes. uh, huh. 06 21 38 56 i_p-eva okay."
"okay, you want cabin's at 4.8 now; repress is about empty. okay. no, not yet, it's still getting a little bit."
00301.
"there it is - man! now, go out, dust and every- thing."
"houston, my cryo press light in the - -"
"do you want this rock brought back, tony? that is - that i'm - for the lpm?"
roger. we're reading you loud and clear.
"okay, joe. i got into p52 about 49:34. we loaded the planet - or bennett comet vectors into the planet option, and p52 tracked it all the way across except that it was always occulted by the lm, and we're in a roll angle of 155 now."
"no. i was just curious what the recovery area looked like, and i'm sure that my compatriots will clue me in on it, if i'm nice to them."
"boom, boom - there we go. man, oh man l"
huh? what? hammer's on the mesa.
yeah. i saw that. that's really strange.
"trans control power, on, up; verify."
no. that's what bothers me.
"the agc - agc is 2.7. radiator temperature 1.6, and the power is 2.9."
roger.
"that's a great guidance system on that out-of-plane, huh, dick?"
"oh, oh. let me. let me do some more things here. this ain't going to work (laughter)."
roger.
"yes, yes."
"oh, okay. 6"
"yes, specially when you don't know you're talking."
"okay, it's right on 4000."
wow!
"yes, i think you're right. i ... 06 14 55 26 cml= right through here. 06 14 55 51 cml° you're going to like this burn, al. yes. it's a hummer. here it goes."
"15, houston. you're suit integrity check looks good as far as we can tell down here. 07 ll l? 48 c_p well, we had it for about 5 seconds there, and then the 02 flow went back up, so we'll hang on here and see if it comes back down. f_"
"okay. it's there, and steady. 03 09 52 53 _p not yet. okay, the rates are coming off."
"go ahead, karl."
"i tho?,ght we shot those."
"oh, ha, ha. oh, thank you, joe."
"okay. i've got up through step 7 now, and i'm not getting much of a light in the helium indi- cator here. why don't i review for you how we've proceeded, and you look at the procedure you gave me, and see if we've missed anything."
i'll give you a call at 44 miles. all right?
okay. we'll get that as soon as i get this out of the way. okay?
"and, endeavour; houston. are you about ready for your pad?"
"okay. in the left - okay, tony. in the left setting going from right to left. tony, we can look out at the 12 - at my 12 o'clock position here, i can look down and see a large block that's on this inner flank here that i can't - -"
"good show. hey, i figure this thing puts out a half an ounce, don't you?"
"okay, we copied your noun 05, but we did not get the torquing angles. i hope y'all have written them down. 04 01 00 28 _ roger. minus 0.060, plus 0.139, minus 0.018. over. 04 01 00 58 iaip okay, that looks good. that's great."
...?
go ahead. iaip i think i got a visual on the sim bay door now out window 5. it's just about directly off our present plus-y axis.
"yes, we don't have to worry about it."
"okay, ken. how much to undocking?"
tomorrow we do the landing ... eva ...; that's kind of a - ...
that little thing just doesn't want to z _
okay. we did.
roger. we'll do that.
"oh, okay. forgot to look where it stopped. 05 14 04 13 cml° okay. i ended up on frame 92."
fuel is a little iow; oxidizer is a little high.
okay. pan camera power is off.
bully.

"hey, gordo, we got the landing site. we're coming right over the front of it! stand by a minute. you can see the slide. i think you can see the great cross."
did the src get up to the platform? 04 22 17 12 i2_p yes.
"roger. one of the things - when you're taping the - the pages together that you want to be care- ful of is that you - is that you make sure and get the air bubbles out so when you get in a vac- aum, it doesn't open up by itself. and maybe you can put an x across there to - to make sure that you - if you get any separation - that's it's still held together pretty good. we think the tape will work - -"
understand.
"okay, you got d1, b1, [sic] ab, c4, b3, and d4."
is that right? it couldn't be king crater?
"okay, what settings do i use on this color? i don't see how this can show that terminator with color film. 4 '_ page 163"
okay. now to the drill. we last left our friend -
roger.
yes. 03 09 03 32 limp golly.
okay. tape' 17/6
yes. yes. about half a second out - - ok 13 19 54 lmp - - let's do that. give me the dps card again. deca gimbal ac.
"that means we might as well get ready, huh?"
"... 40 on the ems, is that right?"
okay. understand.
"oksy. the next item here is to tske the mapping camepd_ to standby mode, and i assume i should dc that before ! turn the sm/ac power off. 02 oh 03 21 cc that's affirmative, 1_."
"at our 11 o'clock position, we're at 089 for 0.4. we have two very bright, small craters that are 2 - 3 meters across, and we see some whitish material down below in the walls of the craters there. they're about 25 meters off."
yeah.
"hey, the lens in this one is clean, too; good."
"okay. that's correct, jack. and now we'll go into the main bus powerup procedure. and the first step there, is on panel 5- we want the bat charger bat a charge circuit breaker closed, and the bat charger bat b charge circuit breaker closed. over."
i think i see it now.
okay. you want that all the way in?
"16, houston. stand by a little bit, and we'll digest this a while."
"direct, two, off."
"i just did, and it's 123. ow ? 5-1 5"
yes. on this. pull. pull away from me.
"we're just pulling it real fine, tony.."
isn't this supposed to be cut - cut through?
that's correct. configure for .jettison.
"hey, that really goes out!"
okay. it's hooked up now.
we'd like auto on the high gain.
"yes, sir. you're nice and protected. okay. good velcro."
right on. beautiful.
okay.
roger.
"guess what, john?"
"okay; let me take another look at the landing site, and then i'll get it. okay?"
it looks like it's a little tighter.
turn the camera around there. i wish i could give you -
"okay, i copy that, geno."
"okay, fred, i've got six circuit breakers for you."
"yes. ""this vehicle will not be placed in motion until all seat belts are properly fastened. by order of the chief of staff, usaf."""
copy. thank you.
- - is off.
"are we - where are we now? about men - no, we're past mendeleev."
"houston, endeavour."
"okay. apollo 15, houston. turn your mapping camera, off."
"you want to record the percentage. i guess, right now, it's 100 percent."
the total is slight [?].
negative; just the option 1.
"all ready to mark, x and y. okay. marked x now. (eagle) 0504 4958 cmp ... (columbia )"
ye_.
okay. lgc. what am i doing? go.
pocket is fairly full of dirt.
"okay, joe; we certainly did have a nice sleep, and we think your tracking data must be right. the moon is getting bigger out the window."
att 1/rate 2.
"okay, bob. tei-5, sps/g&n; 38570; plus 0.49, plus 0.92; 098:39:43.24; plus 2329.8, minus 2403.1, minus 1152.8; 193, 099, 318. rest of pad na. sirius and rigel; 133, 200, 030. ullage: four jets for 12 seconds. comment 1: burn undocked; comment 2: assume doi."

okay.
"okay. cb(16) ecs' cabin repress, closed; verify. 04 23 14 lh i_\_ verified."
"okay. hank, i didn't follow that. i thought we were in the ecliptic aux ptc at - for this earlier maneuver. so - say again what happens at 273:15."
m** l0 minutes to 6 at home.
keep going.
"roger. that item 178:30, on the m-_s spec, the discriminator value there should be low. copy?"
go ahead.
... i_w_-eva got your h_mer?
"okay, ken, i only got part of that, i was scrub- bing my face here. you want to save the same comm configuration we've got right now. is that correct?"
"yes. make it easy on yourself. just a minute, let me get the down-sun here. ***"
"okay, houston. burn stat_ report follows. there is no delta-tig. burn time, 242.4. there was no trim. and the residuals were measured at 184, 005, and 351 degrees; 0.2, vgx; 1.2, vgy; 0.1, vgz; all pluses; minus 19.1 delta-v c. which was the fuel and which was the oxidizer, charlie? 3.97"
right to the right?
"okay. we're going to pm, houston."
okay. now i need your noun 20.
"do you have a lot of static, jack, or is it just me?"
"three, six, ... 144, all zips, 1.53, that's csi time."
huh?
"houston, america. you might tell the medics not to pay any attention to those sample numbers on those busses. pay attention to the get time, because when you take them out of the buss storage bag, the right one never comes out. so i don't think it m_kes any difference, just pay attention to the get time."
that's verified. cross ties bus and bal loads open.
- - stab/control all closed except - -
thank you.
"hey, jim, here's this little vent."
...
"roger. roger. we've got just under 8 minutes to go. l0 03 19 17 imp hey, hank, do you have a list of questions? are you going to be reading the questions up?"
"it won't - there's no - there's some snaps on it, but we'll get - don't worry about that. we'll get that later if you can bring it up open."
okay. leave it in p20.
okay. and the cross range?
"anybody - anybody that ever called this place plains, cayley plains, really didn't know what he was talking about. there isn't a plain around here."
verified.
we said - 19:16.
okay. there you go. enter.
read you loud and clear. we're ready to copy.
that's correct. how was the sleep?
that a boy.
"okay. our understanding was there were two uppers and one lower in bag 7, and two lowers under the"
"oh, that's too had."
"ron, this is houston. cml° yeah, go ahead, got."
i guess that sort of depends on what y'all can san about the old platform.
"dave, we missed that last transmission. could you say again?"
roger; looks good dowr_here.
"tell him. he's not reading me, apparently."
ready.
i don't know.
"okay, i'll have jack fix by bag."
and we think it's the eds power switch and the fuel cell ... switch that are drawing the current that you're seeing there. okay. that could well be.
okay. sounds good.
"okay. it's a tli plus 90, sps/g&n; 66953; minus 0.59, plus 1.88; ignition time, 004:40:01.48; minus 0351.8, minus 0000.1, plus 3378.2; roll is 180, 073, 003; noun 94 [sic] is - ha is not appli- cable, hp is plus 0020.1; 3396.4, 4:50, 3380.8; sextant star is number ll, that's ll, 342.4, 32.3. stand by. 17, houston; are you still reading me?"
"no. negative on that, gene."
"that's two lunar - two lunar diameters along the ecliptic in the bright part, right; a quarter to an eighth of a lunar radius out, and that's perpendicular to the ecliptic line on the south pole."
"okay. have we sampled all three of those? 05 08 29 2_ cdr-lm no, we haven't done any sampling around the lm or stations around the alsep site."
"reminiscent of yesteryear. (music: up, up, and away by brazil '66)."
"oh, my. let me try it this way."
"oh, slow. this leveling is really throwing me behind the power curve; but i know they - they're serious about it, so - if i can keep it where it is now, i'm in like flynn. it's perfectly cen- tered. even the gnomon is aligned within a shadow width."
somewhere down in there.
and there's one before that that came off jim's bag rack.
okay.
"... reach for some of that, because that -"
"okay, i'm getting a p in the vent window."
"and i thought i'd just take about 5 seconds here and see if i could get 000 gone, since _e're fairly close to gimbal lock right now."
"roger, pete and al. we copy that. we show you're 3 hours and 7 minutes into it - into the eva. and we'd like you back to the lm to start the closeout in l0 minutes. that's ad 3 plus 17."
it's quite true that i see ... i don't know how accurate that is from this high orbit. we're at 22620 ...
"okay, houston. we're pressurizing rcs now."
...
"yes, is that - but you - did you punch grav after the first reading you gave me there at the alsep? or are you just reading me the same measurements you did before?"
"houston, america, here. we'll probably verb 49 to the thermal attitude."
"i know it. 08 o0 o0 13 _ i - i think we'll catch up over here, ken."
"can you close that behind you, john, here?"
- - take a look at the glycol pump - -
"1510. 05 23 13 01 ij_p _oy, he's getting big out there, too."
"falcon, houston. over."
go ahead.
"can you reach around and hold the hatch so it doesn't blow shut, jim?"
okay. was attitude - how about looking ahead to see if this attitude is going to hold throughout the test?
"gosh, isn't that nice? oh, god damn, there it is - the moon!"
"hey, al? ... g,mma ray and alpha ray and ... all that stuff ..."
"okay. 05 01 41 16 i2_p-eva for some reason, that thing is hard to unscrew off - there we go. hey, ji - tony, i'll save the drill just in case we can - y'all can come up with an answer on that heat flow."
"okay. curve i is two points defining it. the first one is delta-vm of 265, abort delta-v of 1855."
"okay. verb 49, lunar sounder receive only, roll 142, pitch 286, yaw zero."
okay. eliminate pcm cable on - on the sextant photo test.
mark. we're rolling.
"okay. it's quite dark here in the shadow said a little hard for me to see that i have good footing. i_ll work my way over into _he sun- light here without looking directly il,tothe sun. 04 13 27 28 lmt_ okay. it's taut now."
"come on, charlie."
"_ah. you're going to leave that cap on it, anyway."
"okay, hank at - at arm's distance, if you cup your fingers around it, it's about as big as a 50-cent piece. but you can sure tell that it's changed size for the smaller, but we still feel like we're pretty close to it. like i - i don't how far away from it we are, but probably about maybe 25 - 30,000 miles."
(laughter)
"i got the distinct impression they weren't very happy with our questioning. well, i thought the thing to do was do nothing. you know? because then if they decide to go, we're probably still not that - we're within phasing capability. if they decided not to go, then we could afford to use the gas. the thing i couldn't see was why we were still questioning and pressing on, and wasting all that gas to accomplish nothing. now that one really puz - that - on the first rev, that was okay. that would have cost me maybe 50 pounds. oh, yeah. well, we almost were. and that's the reason i asked you, ""should i tag up?"" and you said, ""no."" well, i didn't either. and- no, i - i was just saying, you know, i - -"
that ... is ...
this goddamned clock is out of sync.
"you in? excuse me, john. okay, we're underway again, tony."
"that's affirm, jim. you could maneuver to burn attitude, or you could maneuver to an attitude which should put the sun in the windows to warm the place up."
"side with the deda over there. tap(! '_(__"""
do what? how about s-band aux tv to tv?
understand. don't - don't worry about it - -
i told you wrong.
"okay. 04 00 58 02 _ pro, lights up. super, john. okay, minus 00005, pro. look at that. okay, houston, our torquing angles are minus 0.060, plus 1 - 0.139, minus 0.018."
let's see. have we got - that? 05 15 46 04 _mp pardon?
"verify csm tunnel hatch, pressure equalization valve, and tunnel vent valves closed and tunnel vented. the fact is, we're getting no flow. 03 23 48 08 _ i know it. okay. hey, ken. is the tunnel vented yet?"
"no, the - the - comm problem."
"... we want to go back to track mode, manual; ani we'll use the positions that you have set on the pitch and yaw dials at present."
okay.
okay. was the circuit breaker out?
okay.
"okay. that's the one. oh, there it is. i'm looking on the wrong page."
yeah.
"yes, we need your - we need the pictures."
okay. direct 02 is closed.
i know we're next to that band but i know where we're going. my next is 094/5.1 is what i want for that sample.
get the right tape up.
we've seen pu shi_; the t_ust looks good.
"would you verify your biomed, right?"
"we'll have to take that out when we get in the rover, i assume."
"roger. al, i've got a correction to the erasable loads in your g&c checklist. if you'd fish that out for me, i'll go ahead and read them to you."
"no, we don't have any high bit rate now. lmp-i_m that do make a difference. that's right."
see me? irp-eva come on. you're good.
"that little square metal piece on there. you can just sort of rap on that. ',z< l"
right. copy.
"let's see, i must be looking back at - well, there's swp. golly, i don't know. i 'm looking back at the complex: cochise and shakespeare, and i can see the lm."
and the hatch looked clear when i - sealed it. clear when i closed the hatch.
"houston, how do you read the lmp?"
"well, we'll check this data here, jack."
"okay, let's -"
"jim, are you taking your pan, now?"
... we got jett bag in 3 - 310b ... turn around and look ...
"okay, s-bai_d tra2_smitter/receiver, primary. vhf: off_ off, off_ and off, left, hi. and recorder, off. lift-off minus 16 to postdocking"
mine's open.
roger. i understand. real fine.
this will be easy. this will be easy.
okay. it's off.
and you're looking at the torquing angle.
"yes. hey, houston. we're vox now."
"all right, you guys can do that."
"okay, houston. you read 137"
"look at that, the core tube caps go on and ew_rything. separate, simultaneous communications link in use between cc and cm 06 03 48 43 c_vr2 okay, and the gamma ray is coming to retract -"
... pocket.
"ca_ you confirm pcm - pch sit rate, !,07 07 !i 08 32 l}{s it's lc now. 07 !! 08 43 cc and, chariie, you did call pri!'l_ry evap flow nul:._er !, closed, ! betiev _,. do yol] confirm? ()7 ]i 08 59 ln? 'flqat's right, jim. it was closed. i gave you a mar!.:on that."
"11, you copy? over."
"man, is that full."
"ytca, both to jets."
and get all good things done?
"jack, if you got - -"
"hello there. okay, jack. and do we have the new charge transporter on the pallet?"
"no s i didn't tell them that. and we didn't get a chance to copy them down because i wanted to get them ail down on tape. it surprised me a_er the aps burn because they were relatively large. they were 7 feet-per-second in x, 4 in y_ and 4 in z. ._nd that was, i guess, just short of a 4-second burn somewhere around 4 seconds."
"and, ken. sometime, at your convenience, we'd like to have you push on your biomed sensors. getting a little noise on the data. just like to see something cleared up."
i think that'd been pushing it a little.
"are you all done with the aifmed now, ron? cml° yes, i've got to get it to - get the plate moved back down there yet."
yeah.
roger. we're getting ready to activate the command module rcs and turning logics and arms on.
"okay. let's - 16 auto rcs selects are on. circuit breakers - all in good shape .... , on .... cmc, ·.. tvc. woo! a good one there. rate command ..."
roger.
that 's fine. it's as good as anything.
"apollo 15, houston. we're standing by ready to copy your noun 49s."
"okay, let's go through this sequence. 04 00 16 24 _ okay, i got enough pictures here."
"who, me?"
okay. gloves are go.
"roger, john. when y'all get through stowing and cleaning up there, whenever you're ready to pick up in the flight plan, give us a call. we got a little change to that sim bay configuration, and we won't bother you with it now until you're ready for it."
"yes. wonder (laughter) - the sequence of pauels we go through is somewhat inane. 12 06'50 41 cmp oh, it really is, isn't it? godl"
"yes, i can see that in the shadow."
"okay, i got that thamk you. you happy with the biomed on the cdr?"
"will do, and you're 30 seconds from los, falcon. 07 04 15 04 cdr-i24 roger. see you around the corner."
"houston, if you saw a master alarm, it was the power sce normal switch getting hooked to off."
i don't think we ought to fire anymore.
put it in your parking place here.
okay. looks like we're about a minute from bobo] and [?].
"okay, houston, we're going to transfer the command module."
"oh, yes. that'll finish it up, yes. okay."
"okay. as a matter of fact i'll make sure we're balanced, i'll hop off."
"yes, i can't go up there. let me just - this is going to have to be good. i can't go up there."
"it was wandering around in deadband, and that's so indicative of ..."
maybe you can.
"well, i got the gnomon in the wrong place really. apollo 17 air-to-ground voice transcription 0_ 23 18 xx begin lunar rev 18 0_ 23 _9 22 cmp houston, america ...."
"yeah, but all the questions they ask, i can't answer. 06 21 57 12 c_ you know, hank, one of the things i was thinking about last night that might hel_ remember a lot of the things we've seen - do you suppose there's a - any dac film that i can use to, say, set to look out the window? and i'll see if i can maybe just tape the dac up somewhere and let it take a one-frame-per-second stri_, or something that would give us some reasonable overlap - around the lighted part of the moon."
"but you get the same vertical - you get the same vertical streaking that we do on the edge of serenitatis, off in the massif units."

wait a minute. wait a minute. we can't copy them that fast. wait a minute.
roger. we cannot raise tananarive.

now let the rate damp there for a second; hope it improves.

"and, jim, - -"
and i'm very much interested - very much interested in my rover battery.
okay. it's up to you.
"yeah, there are a few and we'll have a few more in order to conserve power to give you maximum stay time."
...
you - you turned it?
"okay. discussing station 4 here, we'd like your general impression of the rocks. especially the bigger blocks. you described mostly breccias and white crystalline rocks. were there any others - and could - could you just talk about them a little bit?"
"okay. 07 23 1i 57 cmp those two, but not the ones next to them; here."
"the parachutes are fully deployed. the command module is descending, and photo is circling as it descends."
"man, i just figured it out."
"well, this is so level right here, jack, i'm going to just park it -"
"apollo 16, houston. i have your midcourse 5 pad, and if you'll give us accept we'll up-link the tar- get load and vector."
well - okay.
okay. time skip
"bob, while you were talking, i got all the m_es - romeo, alfa, bravo, charlie."

"okay. understand. i think your downslope movement there on stone was probably - probably right. although that wouldn't explain why it was harder at 5 and 6 than at 4. well, anyway. next question here - on that half-orange-sized rock that you put on the lpm, wonder if you could estimate - estimate how common that type rock was around. 09 21 37 20 iamp well, john picked up one just like it up on - it was a grab sample up on sro - yeah, stone mountain. and it - and it - and it was one of the crystalline rocks with that sugary crystalline texture to it."
and i got a control mode so i'm going to set my computer now.
our bias is good.
do a verb 96.
roger. sounds great.
i'm glad we checked pgncs.
roger. copy. thank you much.
no. i couldn't see a light-colored annulus.
"okay, that crater is harder than a son of a buck to find. f-crater is right on family mountain, and there's one to the north of family mountain, a little ways there's a darker crater and then there's also one to the south of it. i can't find one on family mountain at all. i couldn't the other day so i'm going to see if i can find it today."
and that's all for that one.
...
"go ahead, al, houston."
"that ... burn. that _£astbe -maybe ... your engine. that's probably it, because i can see the bell here. so your - your ... pitched to 180 with me. 04 03 47 58 _ that's what i thought. he's been going in under us."
"i got it. leaning on the shovel. okay, houston, it's got some green clast, some white clast, a grayish matrix. the clasts are millimeter size and make up 5 percent of the rock. one big crystal, 5 millimeters across, but i can't tell what it is. but it's a beauty."
...
"(laughter) yes, but - -"
"that's about where they were, ken. i'ts about time to start your v49 maneuver."
"how's the cabin look, houston? looks good here."
"in there or not, charlie?"
can't do nothing. i'm sure that piece didn't bother pete before - -
"okay, and you know i'm - i'm not overhead long enough to be sure that that's what i'm looking at, but it looked to me like it had a - a different kind of glint to it. 05 12 1_ _8 cc okay. i'm sure they've got that."
okay.
(yawn) ... time for ...?
thank you.
okay. the shadow is reading - 1 to the right. pitch is 0.
don't trip.
"okay. and i guess now on the levas, what we're suggesting is you put them - put the two of them in by themselves in a sleep restraint and tie it down on top of a-8. and i've got a lot of fancy words about how to tie it down on top of a-8, if you guys can't figure out how to do it. i can read it off to you, or we can leave it to your intuitive good sense."
what they're looking for is a primary impact crater at descartes.
"okay, jack. we've got attitude control now in the lm. we're going to try to rotate up through the bellyband."
"well, let's see here, now. again, we got the csm/lm sep breakers ..."
"roger, jack."
"i can put on another mag, if you like."

"okay, the met's loaded, houston."
"yes, sir."
"okay, bob, the alignment's good on the heat flow, and i've got the uht out. jack, do you need this?"
(laughter) he copies that. david's here; he says you've kept him so busy he hasn't had time to work on his stereo all week.
"okay, big eye is alive."
... minutes. l0 0b 17 32 cdr - - testing his theories with what we been doing.
okay.
"nothing to change it over here at all. nothing to change it, al, ... that we could use."
okay.
"okay, we'll - no hurry, finish up and get cleaned up there. and the only change, we have some change in the timing as far as the checklist so we can gain back the time we're behind now, which is actually less than an hour. and the only hard- ware change other than deletions is to - that we'd like you to leave demand reg a, closed, at all times. so whenever you come across a place that says open at cabin or egress, we'd like you to leave it closed."
huh? 09 20 40 58 _ we should have thought of that. 09 20 41 o0 cml° ... changing ...
"okay, joe, i'm going to put the tv on the rover now, if you're ready, and so far the lcru is on, locked, cable's connected, the high gain antenna bootee is on. i'll get the antenna as soon as we /_ get the tv on."

okay.
all right.
"how's your rcs looking, babe?"
"okay, jack. notice you've secured from that, and that was going to be our recommendation, anyway. we're going to have the guys in the back room look at it and see if they can come up with some - with some better numbers based on the cone angle that - that you're traveling through, whether there are any roll angles that - that are available to you. and if there are, and we have time, we might give it another try; if not, we just will forget it."
roger. stand by on that for a second.
"okay. the sun should be over your right shoulder, so why don't you take a right turn there. you should be 45 degrees looking up towards ... hill over there."
still deploying. nothing; you're all right. it's coming out a little - hard.
cha_lie might say that looks ba-a-ad. 00 09 05 59 i_p you're right (laughter). 00 09 06 18 i24p did you have a tv picture of the cockpit there?
"okay. pete, before you do that, help - you're going to have to llft this up so that i can take the sample out."
"oh, i thought you meant i was about to lose the core."
"okay, lmp -"
okay. we cut off on a vi of 35614. tfc was plus 02; vg was .o. 05; delta-v c ... minus ... 4.5 ... h-dot ... and altitude is 167.4.

"i guess the world really does turn. i can see some of my landmasses now. it must be australia down near the bottom and i guess we haven't really figured out what's over the - to the left. it must be some part of asia. china, probably."
"okay. we have lm data. 02 05 33 48 _ hey, tony, ask telmu about this 192 package lanyard. i looked at it yesterday, and i could see red and green. it's way out and looks okay to me. is that copacetic?"

"okay, we're moving forward, joe."

no update required. that was just to prevent an overflow. and then i'm ready for the quick changes in the lunar surface checklist when you are.
"excuse me, pete."
master arm is on; i've got one good light - system a.
"okay. we've got a detailed procedure here if you're - if you want to copy it; just in case. cdr-_'4 yes. stand by 1, though."
"if it won't interfere with anybody, i will. 09 21 14 54 _ hey, john. why don't you quit getting up out - in your seat? nice place to put the biomed on."

"here you go, ken. l0 o0 30 50 cml° ..."
"they're about the same as the - they're less than that experiment we ran, but they were about the same as they were in lunar orbit. g4 20 17 42 cc okay; understand. they were less than in the experiment, but about the same as in orbit."

"keep going like that, you may have to throw away muley. 06 07 09 24 lm_-lm ain't on board yet."

ail right.
give us another mark when you start up from that spot.
did you? - is that - is that all going to go in there?
and i'm not even sure that was. i just heard a clank.
"yeah, man."
"okay. stand by. okay. right now, we're in a c'.uitgas diverter pull-egress. cabin gas return _s open, and _y flow is on and john's is in disconnect. do you want us to go to push-cabin?"
got one too?
"yes, that's affirm, bob. i think what i'll do, i'll wear it as a bump hat, you know, and then - and then use the lightweight headset with the - you know, with the earplugs underneath that. i'll put the lightweight headset around my neck, and then have the mike sticking up in front of me, and with the earplugs on. i - i tested that configuration; it's comfortable. no problem. it'll work. and i will not plug in the c_mn carrier at all."
that sounds familiar.
"it came off, gene. it stuck to the velcro."
there are a few out there.

"*** about _** centimeters away, most of the places now."

"yes, i ..."
roger. we see it. confirm.
"and, 13, houston. we have them. you can torque them."
"what's that, dave?"
"okay. i'll - we see if we can get them, ken."
"houston, al's starting up the ladder."
yes.
"tranquility, affirmative. go."
"_ad, you'll exit ptc prior to that - just put that ilajust ahead of the p30."
okay (laughter).
okay. now we want to do some other things with our - where are we?
"ok_my, jack. [ concur. i think it'll work, too. there's oue step that i omitted, which you can do now qult_ conveniently, arid it's this. where you stuff tho towel in the bypass hole orithe bottom, we rcconnmend that you cut a few short pieces of tape and just tape that over so it doesn't fall out. over."
yes.
"no. houston, this is challenger. won't hold on the steerable antenna yet. it looks like i'm getting oscillations in my up-link signal strength, and then it gradually drops off to zero. _ cdr okay. on 16, stab/control, engine arm, closed. 04 12 ob 38 cc okay, jack. we're reading you better now. understand."
"yes. just beautiful for us, ought to be a go."
"okay, stu, you can enable b-3."
"stand by. okay. cleared to go to auto. 04 10 01 06 cmip okay. auto it is. you got a good one that time. and if you're ready, i'm ready to start deploying things here."
"yes, i did."
go ahead.

looks to me like i ought to be quite a ways from kapteyn.

i just thought you might be interested_ we just had a little spurt of dust come up by the window.
roger. looks good.
you better believe it; there you got it.
"gordo, i'll maneuver in about 10 minutes."
just think of that.
"okay. have you got anything to ... if not, i'll do a partial for you."
i don't know. it's on the outer pane.
i'm going to have to hold on to these tongs now. maybe it's a good idea we have two tongs after all.
"well, i love it, and i'm sure it did a good job."
"oh, there you are. this is much better. how is this?"
"white team's really got a busy one tonight, huh, charlie?"
"and, 13, we need omni charlie, please."
"okay, okay. right now for 49."
"did you happen to observe, going by king this time, anything up to the north, any expression at all of the soviet mountains? 06 03 26 39 cml° yeah. i've been looking for those for - quite a few revs now, and i cannot follow the rays of king outsto the north and make any conclusion at all about them. i can see some of the ray material that comes down from king, but - or it comes out from king, i should say - but i'm really having no luek at all tracing that stuff to the north. then i started looking for this - soviet mountains; and, when you look north and south - way out on the horizon here - you get the impression that there's north and south trending, very subtle constructional builds. but i'm not sure that isn't just the way we're looking at it, because every time you look cross-sun, you're gonna see that sort of pattern. anything that's there is gonna show up, and if you put enough of these craters together, they are bound to make a line. so, i can't really say that i see one; it appears to me that if there is, there's a very, very shallow rise which, instead of calling it a mountain range, i would call it more like a plateau front similar to the kant plateau rise as it comes up from behind theophilus."
...
okay. try it - push it in once more.
"roger, karl. there was no operation of the - the pu valve at all until crossover. and then at crossover, it required a - a decrease, and then at about - about 5 minutes and a half into the burn, it started to increase, and i went to the - the increase position at that time. all the operation of the pugs manual operation occurred after crossover. 0b 07 49 26 cc okay; we copy."
"and jim, if material has fallen into the trench, you might want to scoop it out again."
"yes, we'll do it. seems to be something i'm miss- ing in r_his country music. confidential"
101:50 ... in the i_.
"okay, just go after it here. 06 03 56 48 i_p-eva i'll be over at the rover, dave."
and we got the i_mtransmitter lights ... out.
"oh, that ain't the problem."
that's the oakland - oakland and the jets.
"roger. we copy, jack. just a reminder to be sure and configure the comm per the presleep checklist. and, just for your information, jack, i - i hold you at 100,116 miles. i was going to give you a call at 100,000 even, and then i got talking to you. so you've crossed the 100,000 mark right now. tomorrow, you're probably not going to be giving us our weather report. you'll be too far out, but we'll probably be starting to hear from the moon, huh?"
"okay, 17. roger. you were asking about objectives. of course the primary objective is docu - documented samples of the blocks; and then, also, we'd like to get some of the rake and soil sample out in the surface, namely, the rim crater there, if that's available. and one of the things, of course, we're looking for is the variety of rocks here, if there's more than just the one boulder. you can sample the boulder for awhile, but we would be interested in seeing if there is more than just the single type of rock. probably, also, samples from both sides - both halves of the rock. what we said this morning in terms of combining stations 6 and 7 to an hour and 20 minutes -"
roger.
what?
can you get it?
your hoses - we've got to have a better way to store your hoses.
"well, let me out. god d_mn, i was wondering why i was getting wet; there's water under the bulkhead on the - underneath the lc bag. that's where that moisture's been collecting."
i already did.
"that's correct, jack. are you ready to copy the procedure?"
see that - those two up there would be reasonably well up the slope.
"we should have done that. jim's got a 95, and i've got a 93."
"i'll tell you what i'm going to do, al. i'm just going to lope right around here."
hey. does captain america know all about this?
"okay, sounds good."
"oksy. let's see - where was that now, about 131, bob?"

okay. everybody down here thinks that's a - a great philosophy. good.
"descent engine override's open. ascent eca control's open. cwea cycling, cycled; both lights are out. okay. cabin pressure is good. okay."
"those mirrors are as clean as we can dust them, houston. if they don't cool down, then there's a problem with thermal - -"
"okay, charlie. are you on a ray there? or - i know the blocks angular."
real good.
there we go. i did it that time.
yes. i was just trying to see where my head was going to go.
we got a sep.
huh?
you get that - that shadow up there and you're all right.
that's ... probable.
"houston, casper."
yeah. can you?
"yeah, uh-huh. i got bats on."
okay. thank you.
"okay, jack° it got a lot better. you're - you're perfectly readable now. sounding good."
it's going to jump to decrease whenever we pull crossover - -
"okay, suit circuit return valve is closed. suit flow valve - you have flow, jack? suit pressure is okay, and 02 flow is less than 0.4. suit test. okay; i'm taking us up. cmp okay."
"okay. now we run through the pressure integrity check. okay, plss 02 to on."
"and, dave, we assume you are dusting and cleaning now, and we'll be standing by for tv."
"jim, that sounds like a good - -"
"okay, bob, i'm on the pad. and it's about 4:30, a wednesday afternoon, *** step out on to the plains of taurus-littrow, beautiful valley. *** thing i'll do is i'll turn the tge on, and i'll give you a reading."
glad you stopped short of it.

"i think we can do it ourselves, bob."
"okay, h20 flag should clear in 2 to 4 minutes."
yes.
"okay, the rcs pressures are looking good. they're at 3000 --"
"it's a nice little crater, isn't it?"
sorry about that.
"okay, thank you."
i can do one. i'll - probably use the checklist. it's been a long time since i've gone through one.

"that's all right. i just thought i'd fill in a few things. this isn't a good viewing attitude at all, and we get a few isolated views that may be worth commenting on. the contrast, in my eye anyway, between the three color units around the landing site is a - let's call it a medium bluish gray to gray for the dark mantle; a ligh_ blue-gray for the annulus around serenitatis; and, then, a tan-gray for the serenitatis mare proper. and, in dawes, you cmn see - i think you can see that the overturned - or the - the rim materials are made up of the brownish-gray material, and the walls underneath those rims are the bluish-gray, which is the age relationship suggested by topography. that'd be the over - lower unit is forming the rim with inverted stratigraphy."
was anyone in the tunnel at the time of the glitch?
"and, white we got a few seconds there, ed. the raindrop pattern you mentioned_ was it - is it pretty general or is it just here and there that you noticed this texture? 05 12 03 38 _4f no, it seems to be fairly general, fred."
roger. set delta-v c minus 100.
"okay. we're in the tacquet area now, and in this case, the wrinkled ridge system that's out in the middle does not make a change in the color boundary. the color boundary is completely out to the outer edge and is - in the area of those - the rille. those are - there's kind of arcuate rilles, straight rilles, and in the tacquet, yesterday, i said this was sulpicius gallus, but it's tacquet - tacquet area, but ... - -"
"looked good here, goray."
"well, as a matter of fact, i just looked and noticed that it was an eat period. i guess i will go and do same. i got all carried away with this being the first time i've had a chance to look to the south."
"okay. the plss 02, on, we'll do a pressare integrity check here. find that little valve down there. 06 19 12 52 i_{p my 02 is co_ling on."
"roger, houston. for retro, i have the antic- ipated location of all the entry stowage, and i suggest you pull out the entry checklist, and we'll go through those maps in the front of it."

"..., john."

"hey, you got to break - you can cast the tying vote. which is the best description: the water bag or the clock one?"
"negative; stand by 1. 04 04 57 l9 i_mp they got those torquing angles on the grcund, didn't they?"
"go aaead, casper."
i was just bleeding the nitrogen out of the probe.
"okay, my pan? by the way - z got extensive vertical coverage down into nansen, bob."
twenty-five minutes until t3.

"god! there's some - hey, let me get the top of this little instrument box, because the glass is fractured there."
"and, dave. can you verify, were you behind, in local vertical, or body attitude coordinates?"
"okay. we copy. and the last item: we'd like to send you an irig update, so at your convenience, request po0 and accept."
"that's affirmative, al. confidenti.! ij"
"aquarius, hold on to torquing angles, flease."
you're kidding!
"roger, houston. cdr. loud and clear."
"let me see. am i supposed to be retracting that - hey, hank, am i supposed to be retracting that boom now?"
oh.
okay. stand by.
"roger, dave. we agree too. i - it seems to us that that sounds like it was just one of those situations we run a suit integrity check for."
okay. that got it.

"okays it - it must be coming from somewhere else, ken. we've got everybody in the room real quiet now."
"you ought to drop it a little bit more, dick."
"okay. okay, the ags checkout has gone well. we're in - the only thing we haven't done is rendezvous radar checkout and we'll get to that as soon as ken gets through with his burn."

it just sits there and whirs.

yes. and get a piece of both - i think you can get - if you can reach down there.
"orion, houston. when you get a moment, give us normal voice."
"in fact, what, about l0 degrees at the most?"
"bob, the boulder concentrations in the wall of henry have their upslope start at about - oh, i would guess an average of 30 meters down from the rim crest. the rim crest of henry is not very well defined, but it's there. and they - from that initiation of boulders, they stream down the slope to the break in - in slope down at the floor. *** no obvious change in the dark mantle, as we're just to the east of locke now. there's some - there's a 30-meter crater, fairly subdued but still quite deep - subdued rim. again, it looks as if it were mantled; that *** no significant increase in blocks on its rim. that crater, in any other place, would have been a very blocky-rim crater. it has - it's maybe 30 meters and - by 5 meters deep. man, that is a big rock up there. turning point rock is a split rock ... overhang, with another block just this side of it ... pyramid shape in cross section - triangular shape in cross section. and it looks like it is pretty well frae- tured, although not pervasively like the rock at shorty was,"

what's the problem?
"okay, now -"
you want the lcru off?.
roger. are you ready to read it - or copy it?
"houston, challenger."
"okay. i didn't understand that one, don."
we'll be up with the news in a while.
"however, in the next pass around, i'll bet you wouldn't see them."

"orion, you have 32 minutes to ... 07 09 24 03 _ okay."
"those frames that ron mentioned - this is jack - that he mentioned were taken of a area where there's a much lighter gray albedo. rather than the tannish gray, it's pure gray material that generally is on the rim crest of a number of craters. it may be related to the swirls that we see elsewhere."
"oh, we'll - definitely on that one. 02 20 5b 59 lmp bob, ron got you all - the earth down there zeroed in in the sextant, and it puts my little binocular to shame. i tell you, it's a fine instrument. and i'll just confirm that the - that disturbance over the so - solomon islands is an awfully tightly wound little storm system. and right now, i finally have see new zealand for the first time in a couple of days, for sure. and the south island's got some, probably high cirrus over it. north island looks pretty clear. that's the end that i can get right now."

okay.
go ahead.

"it's ll o'clock down here, guys."
good luck.
"it's nice and steady over there, now, dick. i guess something went wrong with the auto track."
"okay. and we haven't changed tlhe settings, al, so, it's - it should - should be in good shape when you turn her to the mesa."
which way are you going to put it on?
that's right.
okay. we'll just let the 7-1/2-second auto ullage do it.

"roger, mike. we see it increasing now. o0 06 25 25 _ hey_ charlie."
"yes. and i think i kicked up some more light- colored albedo. i think, if we have some time when you get through, we ought to - ought to make a quick trench, here, maybe. it looks like maybe r the upper couple of inches might be - the dark gray and below it the very light gray albedo."
"where are you, al?"
"yeah, we're copying you, charlie. i didn't hear the squeal that time, though."
roger. that's - that's affirmative.

and i have a t-start for the lunar eclipse photo's when you're ready to copy.
"guidance control, pgns."
"okay. and, jack, it probably would protect the glass a bit better if you put it in the src gently with the other rocks there. but particularly if you don't fill the src too full. but, again, we'll be putting scb samples in there to more or less flesh it out if there's not too many scb-4 samples."
"okay, thank you, robert. we're hastening to finish the checklist and get to sleep, and unless we have some problems or questions, we won'ttalk to you until tomorrow."
"aquarius, houston. sorry about that but there's too much background noise to read you. i think we'll have to wait until you come up on a new antenna. over. pa_e 532"

"i can't get the rake in, but just - -"
ocps. it's breaking apart on me as i pick it up. i'll try to get most of the pieces.
okay. sounds like real good data - -
that's all right. got to keep you warmed up for the next couple of days.
... on the chart ....
god damn. i wish you'd get to something i know.
"there. okay. why don't you put those on my camera, and i'll put these on yours."
okay. let me just look at something.
are you talking about the diagram or in the sim bay.
did you get pictures of this thing here?
yes. mlay don't you let me finish this? 03 16 05 2k _i{p ... one is terrible ...
right by the pencil.
"okay; we copy that, gene. and do you guys see any tracks coming down to these boulders? do have any feeling that these - you can place these thav way?"
okay; and we need a - we need a lower out of my bag.
"roger. we've been reading you. i think you're on vhf, however. would you like us to reacquire on the high gain?"
"i found it right down in - fred, in this stowage -"
"pitch 30, neil."
okay. did you give them the number?
"okay, houston. we'll start catching up now. we've kind of gotten over the initial checkout on how to walk and move around, and maybe we got - we won't have any problems with this hardware like we did with the - - 04 20 31 08 _ ... here you go."
okays and you want the instrument off?
"that's it, pete."
"okay. and now, i'll stop and rate them here; seems like a good time. i guess target a was ex:_remely good all the way along. target b, also, was _uite easy to recognize. but here again, prim - primarily because of the - of the sun shining on the - on the crater rim. an older, more diffuse crater would be more difficult to pick up, but with those - with those bright - bright rims - bright si_e :o - both targets a and b, it was really no problem. okay. and my last picture, i will give you a mark. when it goes off, it'll be a little past 12:32. 04 16 09 21 c_ and - 0k 16 09 22 cmp mark. last picture on target 4. camera is off. 04 16 11 11 c_ okay. i'll get to moving here, and then i'll pick me up at - oh, maybe between 50 mhd 58. first frame number should be eight. - onfidential"
"good show there, commander."
okay.
"oh, i wasn't even talk - listening for you. i was talking to your wife."
yes; they sure look pretty sitting out there.
"okay, thank you. and i'll let you take a look at mine as soon as i get to the suit part."
"you going to get that sample under there? lma°-eva yes, we got to get the soil."
"five miles north of track. okay. as long as it knows it, it's okay with me (laughter). my ears cleared up. i don't know why. it pisses me off. everything's as clear as a bell."
we got aos. let's wait.
sure. should have.
"well, i don't see any rocks straight ahead."

"don't worry; i wouldn't let him do it, joe."
"and under row 4, under rcs systen_s a/b-2, quad heaters, you notice that we've closed those circuit breakers, but what we want you to do is to - on panel 3, turn the rcs a/b-2 quad switches 1, 2, 3, and 4, off. over."
"okay. real fine. well, we'll wait till the s-ivb does its maneuver here."
i got to get that camera out here. got to get the camera out. i've got it in my hot hand. okay. what's the sep time?
you're just a little bit down in the mud.

"yes, but put your gnomon right over here, and we can get that for glass and that for subfloor."
we don't have to stop for another l0 minutes yet.

"you won't scare me any more if i come on up here with you, will you? (laughter)."
"bob, i wish i could give you more on that structure in there, but i think those lines of boulder sources are about all we can see right now. talked about the lineaments yesterday and they're not nearly as obvious today in the higher sun. looking up wessex cleft - even with the sun in the flat area there, it looks darker than where - than the north massif side. but again, the sun angle may be fooling us but as i recall, it was darker on the photos."

"okay. it's the - it's what happens to you im- mediately following the burns. the sps cuts off, and then 2.5 seconds later in p40, the tv relay gets reset."
"okay, joe. these are buried about - an inch or so. the one i have is subangular; it's covered with dust, but beneath the dust - by golly it's a - it's quite friable and - i see olivine. look at this, jim. in the sunlight, would you call that olivine? and, there is a big lath in there. look at the big lath about a centimeter long and a millimeter wide. 05 02 18 lh lmp-eva yes."
okay. *** c 04 08 23 04 _mp *** on.
"hey, that's - you don't know how happy i am."
"okay. you know those chamber runs we had were probably some of the best training we ever did. i hate to say that, because it was some work. push that thing on. there you go. good. keep trying. it was just a little sluggish. let me verify it. lmp-i_ lock?"
okay.
"go ahead, houston; 15."
think so?
"chained me to the leb down there stowing things and unstowing things, and i finally got a chance to look out and see the world."
want to give me your boost cards?
...
"wtienever you have them, i'm ready to copy. let's press on. age5-54 tonfidenti/ ll 6"
don't want to get it dusty. 05 05 39 10 imp-eva yes.
"yes, i'm not surprised at anything around the moon ... 07 02 12 08 _ in what way?"
"... oh, excuse me. i stepped on your tail."
"i've got to turn my oxygen on a second, jack."
okay; and i'm checking the circuit breakers.
"okay, the first ring of orientale is showing up. the inner - next ring in is extremely obvious; got some very bright east - east-facing slopes."
"feel that beauty come on. okay; thrust-to-weight is good - 66,000 feet. they were right on."
"that's affirmative, jim. right on."
"why don't you wait until we start driving? oh, shoot. i forgot the tv. 06 o0 56 36 irp-eva i think it might be - this one might be working, joe - -"
mark.
okay.
"yes, sir; probably from the deepest part, because we're right on the rim."
and i have your midcourse correction number 2 pad when you're ready to copy.
"roger. waste compartment valve has b,_en in vent for - oh, i guess, 45 minutes or so."
...
affirmative; copy.
"okay, they're all on pwm 1, and do i have to be in pwm 1 select 1, or both."
"go ahead, houston. did you copy our resdduals?"
"you're getting all sky, 04 18 55 07 imp let me zoom back in again."
okay. you're quite a bit better.
looks good.
okay.
"oh, okay."
just spectacular.
"okay. i'll read them fast first here so you get a general idea. i_mpad, service module jett attitude, moon viewing attitude, sun viewing attitude, and lm jett attitude. the cm pads are coarse aline angles for lm attitudes during moon and sun sightings, coarse aline angles for entry refsmmat, and cmc angles on entry refsmmat for ia_jett. moon viewing, and entry. okay. that - that's general pad infor- mation. if you want, itll read it slowly so you can copy it all down; otherwise, i'll go ahead. tape 8_1_ l_ag_ 621 05 05 _,5 _0 cml' [ g/:t - ] wa:; tr'y_ng to copy it as you were reading it,, va.nv_. the lm pada ar(z service module j(:ttl_on att[tud(_, moon viewing attitude sun vicwjng attitude, and lm jettison attitude. is that correct?"
"joe, our clocks were running pretty fast when we were there, and i guess - we didn't get a chance to look at the distribution very well. as i remember it, there - there were more blocks - not really blocks, but large fragments, on the order of 6 inches to a foot, more on the southern rim, although it wasn't really heavily concentrated; i'd say l0 percent of the surface at most. there was more on the southern rim than on the northern rim. and the ones we sampled all looked pretty much the same. as i remember, the radial sample didn't show a great difference in rock type. although, as you know, we just didn't - a chance to do much - looking and thinking then."
"i see a place where we can get a chip off the bottom, houston."
and would you like for me to go to a/c roll for vhe norr_ai roil coming up _o control?
you sure about that?
"okay. it looks like the prime recovery area and the samoa island region is clear, and my guess would be from the fairly subdued zero phase point, that they might have fairly nice seas out there. the boys on the ticonderoga are probably enjoying themselves immensely, i hope."
okay. understand. the reason - -
"yes, that's right. okay. that's all for that page, fred. that should add up to six circuit breakers all closed, on that page."
"cdr, you're loud and clear on vox."

"go ahead, charlie."
okay.
okay; let's - let us get all this sim _ay stuff cleaned up first.
where you got blocks in - -
"oh, yeah. i'll - i'll -"
"i've got the lm in sight to my 10 o'clock. you know what i feel like, al?"
"yeah, but - are you sure that, for example, that we don't have at least thousands of chamber dumps that'll tell you the same thing?"
"distances are very deceiving. *** like we've been driving for an hour. are you sure that's elbow, jim?"
"okay, karl; understand. let me get the flight plan out here. 06 18 0;425 cmp okay; ""gamma ray gainstep, shield, off"" has been deleted."
right here?
"we aaye auto ignition. oh 12 02 30 lmp okay, that - good - good i_nition."
"b was selected, karl, but dave moved the selector out of - just barely out of b and back into the b position to obtain the higher reading."
"challenger, houston. you have a go for undocking and sep."
you want me to adjust it?
"you know, a burnt picture isn't much good."
"okay, i got 0.68 on the - -"
let's do it.
"no, i turned it off. it was out of film."
yes.
"hey, joe. stand by, will you?"
"..., jim.... one whole week ..."
- - before i leave.
"okay, we're looking down here."
and the core tube caps.
"and it's got black streaks coming out of it. okay, our amps are now up to 6 - 60 - well, wait a minute. that 's volts."
on.
"no, i can't - i can't reach it, charlie."
okay.
"ail righty. thank you, sir, and we'll see if we can conjure one up for you."
"houston, aquarius."
i don't know.
"13, houston. go ahead."
"okay, start - okay, ken, the paint is blistered on the quad above the sim bay, too, pretty badly."
"yes. it seemed to happen at the time i put the plus x thrust to it, and apparently it wasn't centered, because somehow or other i acciden- tally got off in attitude and then the attitude hold system started firing."
"okay. okay. we want back in again the next step which is ""at burn attitude: verb 40 noun 20, e_ter."""
"okay. alpha/x-ray covers, close, charlie."
"no, we're reading you loud and clear. if i was a little late on that, it's because i've got some problems down here on my console, that's all. the whole room yelled at me that you'd ealled."
"trouble is, they're looking into the shady side of the block."
"looks like the best way to get a steady view through the monocular is just steady it out and let it close when it's in front of your eye, and then you kind of float up next to it so that you're not touching it at all. it has a very slow drift, and you get a better - steadier view that way."
"houston, columbia. columbia)"
we're not supposed to.

with a miss of 1.6 miles.
i'll get it.
"eon, we'd like accept on the computer. we have a new state vector for you. your downtrack there got to be in excess of 30,000 feet, and this has nothing to do with your backside water dump just now - it's just accumulation of errors in the path."

okay.

"okay, stand by, 13. we're looking at it."
"roger. and no reports - no report from the chinch bugs there, mike."
"and, dave, we're - -"
huh?

we haven't heard any report from you on - and we're just kind of curious. have you had a lot of condensation moisture around the cockpit?
...
"don helmets, then visors."
okay.

... do it at 169 hours.
"okay, we delete ""verb 41 noun 91,"" and we say ""no verb 41, manual verb 16 noun 91."""

okay. ags.
okay. you have the dsky now.
"yep. my first problem was when i went to put the chlorine ampoule in. and at some point in there when i went to take it out, i tried to get it in and it didn't look right. when i went to take it out, it started bubbling all over, and i couldn't tell where it was coming from then. and whether it came from those two holes or not, that's quite possible. i'm not sure. when i looked at the ampoule itself, after i opened up the injector, you could see that the - the bottom lug had broken, the little sliding plug in there."
i don't think a switch can do that to you.
"okay, that'll make the surgeon happy."
oh. lmm-eva but you're right about on the massif.
"okay, al. we copy. thank you."

i could get it if i could stand up and lean over.
okay - -
".,., jim."
"just a passing comment, joe. we're having lunch right now, and i just made myself a hotdog sandwich with catsup. very tasty and almost unheard of in the old days."
take another one. 06 20 21 38 i_4p everything moves.
you want to do one?
okay. we'd like to get the fm up now to look at some inside pictures there.
"well, there's some under my feet if you want to use those."
"roger. now we assume you're all set up or about to get that way for the landing site photos. yes, sir. there is no obvious ray pattern or secondary pattern outside of that blanket around picard."

and we real - really make good time around here.

that's right_ the serial numbers on the purge valve.

that did it; the sun came up. zap! ... the quads and everything else ...

okay. it seems to ha_jepopped right up very nicely this time. 07 02 3_ 54 lmp thst's affirm. 07 02 35 01 i_p okay.
"well, let's just talk some words here for a minute, and then i'll go through some specifics that you can just write down on a page because you don't want to do it until a little later. okay, what we're going to set up here - you will arrive at lunar orbit at the same gmt time. _le landing sun angle - sun elevation angle - and the camera settings and everything will be unchanged when you get to lunar orbit. to compensate for the 2 hour 40 minute late launch, we're going to hack 2 hours and 40 minutes out of the timeline. and we're going to - they'll be out of the tlc timeline - and we're going to do it in two groups. and this is where you might want to start copying now, ron. delete 1 hour from 46 to 47. from 46 to 47, we're just going to delete the activities that are pres- ently scheduled at 46:30 to 47:00, you'll perform at 45 - move those to 45. let me read that again. delete 1 hour from 46:00 to 47:00. the activit]_s that are listed at 46:30 to 47:00, perform at 4%:00."

here's all these goodies.
"yes, but the - the - no, the topography change is just a gradual - gradual change - with - there's a mound- there it is. i got to switch to all the windows."
... to secs pyro arm.

get it?
"hey, number 12, houston."
how about a verb 40 noun 20 or something to - to lock up that - -
"okay, the noun 20s all look pretty good - -"
understand 8 amperes before pressing the switch. 04 20 07 47 imp that's affirmative.
... to come off? i2_p-eva you got to unlock it.
"16 - 16, houston. i've got a map update, rev 1_ it's at about 73:20 in the flight plan, and also i've got some answers to ken's earlier question about this glitch and what if it occurs following a burn."
"ckay. i got all - al] readings, ed. 05 12 00 54 i_p and that was the high-scale reading."
and commander fdi.
roger.
go.
"okay, if you're on vox, you're cutting out pretty badly, too. thirty seconds."
"houston, apollo ll is calling you on th_ high gain. how do you read? over."
... casper. over ....
okay. z - i just need some gouges to when i get it nulled.
"okay, and we'll torque them at 22:45."
(laughter) 03 08 36 0! cdr so what did they put on my leva?
"okay, the gdc's aligned behind - to behind you at 51:05."
okay. 06 2] 39 38 cc out again on that sunny descartes plains.
"roger, jack. we're reading you pretty good - voice."
we thought maybe you were getting on - -
"we already used a whole bunch. ail this is black and white, isn't it? we don't have another black- and-white roll?"
"for the ejecta pattern of eratosthenes, you can just see it looking back into the sun now, and the terminator is right - right in the middle of eratosthenes now. and you can sure see the classic impact ejecta pattern around it. it goes out for - you know, _]most two crater diameters as we can see the topographic expression. you can see the scalloping or scouring as it's gone back across there, due to the shadows that are crea_ed in the low sun angle."
"now, all we'remissing is s, per his ..."
i don't know how to keep that thing on. i_ip-eva make it west.
"i'll have to look at f crater again the next time i come over on the thing, because i spent most of the time looking at - shorty."
okay; 371.
"en route, now."
copy that.
"roger. we just did it, bob."
good to hear your cheery voice. how is everything up there?
"okay, ed."
"okay, go ahead, vance."
"well we - i think maybe that's true, however, we did not see isolated fragments of it very often, if at all, out here on the, the plains themselves, away from the craters. so if the blue-gray breccia does - the van serg breccia does underlie the sub- floor_ the craters are not - it's far enough that the craters we have apparently have not penetrated and brought up much of that kind of material. well that's it."
outstanding. and we've proved the lever princi- ple again. 05 01 45 49 i_mp-eva yep.
"ron, we'd like to get ready - started on some of these state vectors earlier - this state vector, and the jet-on monitor. so if you'll get accept, we'd appreciate it."
"houston, i'm need to process - -"
"lower. i'm sorl_, bob."
"and, john, do you have a bag number for your white rock, or have you collected it yet?"
ok_r.
give me your hand. give me your left - your right hand. it_p-eva huh?
"turn around here, jim, let me get your - - 05 04 02 50 ia{p-eva okay, i'm - i'm 385; my pressure flags are clear, and i'm reading 45 percent."
"one minute, you ought to have 98."
"no, that's all right."
"bob, we're still - we're moving in and out of areas of say 1-percent to 5- to 10-percent blockiness. and where it gets blocky - not only is it more blocky, but we seem to have more of the medium- sized craters in the range of 20- to 5-meter- diameter craters. that may be mariner right there."
eureka!
"it's a little ways off. c_p okay. proceed, it was aldebaran .... dnoces. to dnoceso 6. dnoees is hard to _'ecognize through the telescope. must be it. yes_ that was it."
"intrepid, houston. we'd like to get your valve on transmitter power on that."
- - mentioned up on north ray that you only went in - -
yeah.
okay.
i wouldn't believe that in a million years.
"okay. i guess what we should do, dick, is just vent that baby for a couple of seconds afterwards to shut her off."
thank you and go ahead.
"okay. that's great, john. 06 22 h3 08 cdr-eva he wants us to park where? 06 22 43 10 lm2_-eva 360. head on out to the rim. okay; that's a brec- cia. that white one's a breccia."
"okay. panel 16, top row, we want to close quad 1 through 4 tca breakers, and you're saying the other three rows are as is. again, i have the exception the ascent eca control on 16 should also be open."
"it's awfully bouncy too, isn't it. okay. get your seat belt out later, i reckon."
"john who? (laughter) he strikes again. you'd broke yours off sure, because i wouldn't have seen it as you went up unless i took inventory with my book, which i'll do here in a minute. open battery covers, taken care of; dusted lcru; blankets open 100 percent. they've been open 100 percent all day."
yes.
"okay. thank you. 03 0b 49 00 cdr boy, we must be getting pretty close to the moon. 03 03 49 03 imp what's that?"
"have at it, verner. [?] and i'll pick us out a route to go when we leave here. get up to north twin, and there's a nice outcrop up there, too. 06 21 55 23 i_mp-eva okay. i need a bag."
ail right.
make sure the belt goes down all the way in the back here.
"okay .... zero's off, cmc - (humming) okay, we're passing over the sculptured hills. and coming into _he landing site now. i still say - i'll start the old dac. oh, boy, that's going to be bright."
jack? k_p-eva yes.
roger.
"negative. it's not. the last time we broke lock, we went to auto, and i left it there. sorry."
fan is on. vent flag is clear.
"(cough) we thought about bringing them both back, but since you said not to, we left one on the surface. but you'll have the cdr's."
okay.
"understand, from all ones to lll01."
what are the angles?
... it's out of the way.
okay.
"orion, will you verify auto on the steerable? 04 00 45 14 imp it is in auto. okay, and reading back starting with lima, 098:59:29.0b; 105:19:45.00; november, 100:42:42.86. go ahead with the next one. over."
...?
"okay, houston; the primary evap flow time, 108 - evap flow time, 108:16:55. and i'm ready to copy your abort constants and a doi-2 pad."
that 's affirm.
"hey, great! 07 23 21 31 l_ okay, houston, the preseparation checklist is com- plete, except for completing the maneuver and going to p41."
okay. 06 00 46 29 i2mp ... 3.6 plus 00235.
"hard, isn't it?"
okay. managed to set it right in a crater.
looks flat. looks very flat and smooth.
"endeavour, this is houston. how do you read now?"
"0kay, my plss 02 is off. and warning light, off. okay, verify cabin pressure stable at 4.6 to 5, _ and it looks like it's 4.5 and stable."
roger.
that's what i thought.
"okay. vance, stand by for the main ..."
roger. you can leave it on - dave.
"hey, bob, while i'm thinking of it, we're - we're working with one pair of scissors down here. we're going to take them out with us in the etb. you might make a point of reminding us to bring them back."
let me cover up my mike.
"all right, just a second (laughter)."
okay. we'd like to start with the vhf test when you're ready.
"i want us to do it, bit i - -"
those were gimbal angles for - pitch and yaw.
"no, we missed it."
"aquarius, houston. over."
"boy, i look at some of these rocks that are filleted here, jack, and there sure are a lot of sparklies in them. awful lot of sparklies."
"all glassy, isn't it?"
"okay, tony, the 500 millimeter's up to 50."
"yes, i'll buy that. that's in my scatter. and then that crater, as i looked out at 9 o'clock, we landed next to was actually poppy. pretty sure that's that large crater."
okay.
"okay, old sample bag -"
roger. ()kay. what are you going to do?
copy that.
"roger° we're still reading you, jack. cdr-eya okay. are you reading us through the lm or through the low gain?"
...
what a sport!
roger.
"all right, sir."
this isn't running.
come on now.
"dave, we also need the tv c_meras turned off at this time, and see if you could brush the top of the camera with your glove, please. it's getting very warm. i'm sorry, that bad input - -"
it stopped.
thank you.
"stand by l, charlie - - o0 o1 39 58 _ okay - -"
"okay. you on b, now?"
how about three?
"same thing, hank."
"roger, readback correct."
"no. okay; 5515. gordy, how would you like me to handle r-3 of noun 76?"
"just like neil and buzz said, al. you get on a little slope and you tend to keep on going."
"89:20. what time is it over there, dick?"
"okay, clear of the hatch. give me a jettison bag. 04 17 47 32 i_p roger. let me get over here on the other side, so i can get to it. 04 17 47 46 lbip oops."
a few days.
"houston, falcon. do you have the torquing angles?"
"okay. mighty fine, gordo. thank you."
"have we been out there an hour? been out here an hour? tony, we've been here an hour?"
"40 decrease. 03 10 06 23 cml° looks like a plaster-of-paris cast. 03 10 06 25 _ it sure does, doesn't it?"
"okay. 05 11 09 30 i2*ip okay. *** give it a try. 05 11 09 44 lbip okay. water flag a. 05 11 10 24 _2dp okay. turn plss feedwater, on. 05 1i 10 42 i2_,p feidwater, on. 05 11 10 h6 cdr can you get the - - 05 11 i0 48 ii_lp pardon."
"go ahead, pete."
wait a minute.
"*** thousand and, oh, fourteen - 400 plus 4."
okay. _2-eva okay.
i think i left my oxygen off. coming up.
roger. we want you to start at 170:28. 170:28.
"okay, we see you."
it is hold/fast.
what?
"okay, is that an up-link or do we load?"
beautiful.
rcs looks good.
okay.
"okay. i don't know when it was 0.6 up there, but i looked at it last night, and it was 1.2."
"yes. yes, we really got that one messed up."
five minutes ... 4.6.
"no, no. no, i didn't."
it ain't gonna fit.
"looks like we're getting good data now, char!ie. stand by. we're up-linking now."
yes.
ail right. ° 06 o1 08 09 lmp ... that radar in s-band ...
"that's affirm, ron. we'd like to get a third dump now, so we have it dumped prior to the camera pass."
...
"roger. get out of the way please, jack, and we'2! take a look against some bright soil."
sure is. wait a minute. wait a minute. don't close it. !_p-eva want me to get out of the way?
right. ·
"that's affirmative. coming up cn an omni switch, 16. stand by."
"okay. now, let me go ahead and track dick."
okay. i'm down to 3 pounds - differential.
"i figured what had happened is that the command module had separated from the service module elec- trically. something like that, i mean, you could ..."
yes. i think i can get closer than that and ...
"*** it, don't they?"
"okay, real fine."
502.
"yes, joe, it's coming down. i got just about 45 degrees now and it's coming on down."
"oh, okay. that's right. okay. that's right, these are just short sounder passes now, aren't they?"
"yes, sir. that is verified. !'af,,(:):_, 0% ;'1 i _ :_ ci,h'i ... il':; _ljr'_li_i_lr_pi__,_w_ .io,_. 05 21 13 }_3 cc roger. we think that you were just pressurizing the cabin up to that regulator's particular spec."
"okay. we copy that, geneo."
"okay. the set stars are, as always, sirius and rigel; 133, 200, 0305 four jet; 12 seconds on the ullage. three notes: burn undocked, assumes no circ, longitude of the moon at - it'll be minus l_0.19 degrees. over. tig bob, give me note 2 again, please."
roger.
pardon?
"what did you say, tony?"
"gordy, you can record that as the second commander's p52 that came up all balls."
"how's it driving, john? pretty easy?"
roger.
okay. you ready? [_4p-eva let me change n_ysetting here.
"houston, _his is 17."
"okay, thank you very much. i'm all set up to come up on crozier."
verify that; okay.
"i'll bet you - i wouldn't be surprised if it didn't come from that crater. too bad we can't stop. there's a rock that was sort of rounded, but had a rough surface texture to it, about a half a meter in size, and it was about l0 meters down- stream from a nice fresh crater that had a lot of angular debris in the bottom and the walls."
that's a verify.
"roger, america. and we anticipate no problems with using 211."
now wait a minute. (tranq)
"we could probably - we could probably have done it, but i think that'd really been pushing it."
"i tell you, this thing really flies beautifully."
"and the cover is up. cover is up, if i can keep it up. if i can keep it up. that'll keep it up. it's been dusted. and i'll get it to standby."
"that's affirmative, ken."
okay?
sounds like a good idea.
"roger, ed. i got that; 18-n. 05 14 24 32 imp okay, and i have taken the bottom core of that one, whioh was core 1 flagged; and it's now by itself - as a single core tube; i'm going to replace that with - number i unflagged, which is one a1 started to l_e earlier but didn't get anywhere with it."
"i'm reading 136 - make that 132 on battery number 2, and we did get a flag."
okay. p47.
it's not bad. we're hauling our ass through here. look out that - look out your side window. son of a bitch!
(laughter )
man.
"bob, you're cut -you're being cut out. i can't tell what you're saying. isn't that where we __ want to go, over there?"
"on your next page, _n compartment b1, we esti- mate about 15 percent of that food is remaining. in b2 we took ppk out of there and put trash in it. in b3, the t6-millimeter cable, the 18- millimeter lens, and the right-angle mirror are on window number 4. and that there brings you all up-to-date."
roger.
okay.
"thank you much there, bruce and fred show, we appreciate that."
"twirls? no, sir. i'm talking about these little benches that are on the side of every piece of material that sticks up through the mare surface."
"okay. for the pb0 cire pad. noun b7 - i mean noun 47 is 37983; plus 0.40, plus 0.91; 111:57:28.09; noun 81, plus 0070.5, zero on the y, and a minus 0.5 on the z. okay. the roll is 0; pitch, 092; yaw, 358. noun 44 is 69.7 and a plus 54.5. delta-v total, 70.5; burn time, 0:04; delta-v, 59.9. sirius and rigel; 1bb, 200, obo. that will be four jets at 12-second ullage."
i've got the cam - i got gg on the camera.
"okay. i didn't push down on it, i'll lock it. it - or - you might have to hit it down."
okay.
roger. and we're in no hurry.
... diverter ...
"hey, it's still dark outside."
your eyes all right?
"okay. our first question here on the portable magnetometer - i forgot to re - i forgot to ask you. it was my omission. i was wondering what the temp label on the top - on the electronics box read, if you remember."
i can't see what the - -
"go ahead, 15."
"okay, and that sto_ system that was out west of alaska or thereabouts appears to be still there."
"here you go, charlie."
"nell, this is houston. we'd like you 911 to get two core tubes and the solar wind experiment; two core tubes and the solar wind. over."
"okay, forward hatch, close and lock; dump valves both auto, okay; confirm our water closed. let me see if i can't get my ... here."
"lie said we're gonna use it for sleeping. o.of 06 32 12 cc great. _ust what we wanted. 06 06 33 28 i24p-i2._ okay, ed, _¥ ops ... pressure is 6100 and john's is 5900. over. 06 o_ 33 38 cc read you."
can you see yourself?
"roger, 13. we see it. looks good."
- - landing site. f
torque.
"okay. and did you copy the - the deletion of _ic mode, free, down to the gdc align that's at 164:167"
"inverter i is closed, charlie."
"two of the corners are - - lmp.-eva yes, wait a minute - -"
"yes, it's okay. i was checking it a minute ago; it looks okay."
"i sure didn't see you. you want a flashlight, ken?"
"hey, ken's right out in front of us, maybe about a - 600 feet, so we have a visual on him."
"okay, fine, ron."
"we got you, bob."
"we're watching it, henry."
yes.
"*** no, you're right at the edge of cochise."
"understand. hey, that does a good job on the lens there."
"yeah, well, we'll be - we'll get in right in a hurry."
"and we've got almost a second core. got another couple of inches to go, jim. doing good."
copy that.
it's almost right in the center of this window. starts - and these two craters are together.
we can do it either way. i had planned the positive.
roger. that's all we were assuming.
"okay, then, jack. continuing on, everything's okay until you get dowrj to - on the next page, you get throueh ""verify 02 flow indicator no in- crease."" we would like to delete everything below l_age 667' that, unti] the iast atop, which .[_ tunnel lig}!t'j, off. ilo ,'_tarting with ""before undocking only,"" delete ail lines through ""tunnel vent valve to tifnnel vent."" 05 08 ]2 50 cmj_ okay. delete tilesection that says ""before u_l- docking only"" down to where it says ""tunnel vent valve to ti[nnel vent."""
"well, if i park on the other side, they won't be able to - i can go right upslope a little bit."
okay.
that makes me sick. that ...
look at data on the dsky. it's stabilized and is holding steady now.
"i knew we were going in - i don't even think - dick gordon said something about that tower, and i was still watching."
"dave, do you see spur as you look up there? - -"
"go ahead, houston."
"okay, fi'ed. the next thing i'd like you to do is to tsd_esome more gray tape and tape over half the outlet area of each of the blue nozzles; the co_ander's and the lmp's. the reason we're doing this is we're going to be running this loop through the secondary lioh canister hole with the canister removed_ and we don't have the flow restriction we need to keep the separator from overspeeding. over."
"my ears just cleared. man, that hurt."
"yeah, i got it. okay. 07 05 20 1_ cc okay. you can start turning pages now, i guess, and we want to - _ the old 176, we want to scrub that whole page. actually, we are gonna scrub everything from i76 on up through 181 up - well, up to 181. so page 176, 176:30, scrub those two columns. on the next page, the 177, the - -"
yes.
ready or not.
okay. we'll be ready in a second.
"okay, dave. according to our calculations here_ you'll ¢ust about fill hadley riile with water."
you've still got some irish pennants floating loose here.
"ken, your current attitude is good for stars 15 and 21."
... like a p30 pad. it'll be okay.
one minute and 30 seconds coming up.
"good for him. hey, jim. 06 21 13 58 ia{p-eva yes?"
why not? there's nothing in - the flight plan ... nothing in here ... that i can see.
"oh, my god."
okay. you're - you're -
first one today.
"okay, and the reason for that is for better coverage going through hawaii and that and then omni charlie is coming back up on the aria."
"i can't see where i'm going, charlie."
"do you realize ... we got out? 07 0041 46 cdr do i? i could have - i was - ... go by the crater, and i thought i'd landed - next to the ... crater ... we were still talking about it, see; and -and - and, well, we were still talking about it."
it's on.
okay. fine.
"roger, alfredo. sps/g&n for a tei-64; 36310; plus 0.61, plus 0.92; 204:08:11.62; plus 3011.0, minus 0019.6, plus 0048.8; 180, 102, 002. all the rest na. ullage, four jet, 12 second. over."
0h! did you notice anything loose?
that's affirm. you can delete that one.
how come you don't ...?
"... attitude, anyway."
we ought to bring a big piece of that home. that's obvious - it's obvious - -
"you might get him over the landing site, if you're careful."
"buzz, this is houston. have you removed the closeup camera from the mesa yet? over."
"now, i need the - i need the eyepiece."
"yes, david; it's okay."
"yes, we were wondering if it drifted while you were there, because we're going to give you now a - -"
oh.
"well, peirce charlie has really got some black lines going down, vertical down them."
"okay, karl. i'll delete it."
...
... out there.
"okay. this assumes all descent bats on line, and ascent bats 5 and 6 on normal feed. go ahead."
yes. i said where do you want it?
mark. and ... that's a good sign.
okay. i can see the s-ivb now out the hatch window and it's - -
"yes, this is elbow right here."
yes.
"roger. the - your first part of your transmission was blocked out. we had a antenna switch. how- ever, on the ptc, guess he thinks it will go throughout the s].eepperiod, and then we'll reini- tialize after you wake up. but he doesn't think it'll go a full 16 hours, but it's good for the sleep period."
"howls that, charlie? hey, we got a picture again."
"okay, 00090, all zeros, o0111. over."
"hello, orion and casper. this is houston."
"well, watch this real quick."
"- yes, you got them."
roger.
"16, g&c advises use the pressures and not the light in regard to the burn."
"hello, endeavour. this is houston. 09 03 17 28 i24p go ahead."
"*** even look, bob. it wa_ 125 - 125 when we started the station."
got to be.
why don't we get some samples of that material in there.
okay. it's closed.
okay.
"*** that. after y_;u_ive me a mark there, we'll give _u - i'll talk to you about it ·,, o"
okay. regulator check. let's press on with this.
watch that foot.
"okay, jack. it looks like we've closed up the loose ends here. amazingly enough, out of all that stuff, it looks like we only generated one question on the floor, and we'll research that one. we'll even let you guess what it might have been. if you have any questions, after you mull it over, why, we're always available. just ask us what you're thinking about."
come on ...
where? up on the thing? 05 23 17 20 i_-eva yes.h. up on the - handtool carrier -
"that's affirm. you know what happened? the velcro came unbonded. that's why those don't hold down. we probably ought to get a piece of tape on those. because they've got to set and it's going to get dusty. the blankets - there's no velcro left to hold the sep blankets down, bob."
"okay, we copy. sounds good. 06 00 09 _6 lmp-eva okay, got the display? okay, i'm around to get the 500. tony, i - you just can't believe this - you just can't believe this - there's a ray - this view. you can see the lunar module, you can see north ray with boulders on the southwest side, and where station 12 is, there's one huge boulder that's going to be just great. it looks like we can get up there, and there's a great ray pattern going up the side of smoky mountain from - from north - from north ray."
...
"looks like it to me, too, yeah. let's see if we can get a piece of that. okay, tony, this is a subrounded rock - boulder that's a meter to a meter and a half across, it has a predominant fracture set of 20 centimeters on the side that run here, southeast - correction, southwest northeast. it's the predominant fracture set."
"okay. we copy that, john."
might be a ... 00 02 21 41 cml° get started.
you got to clean off your lens - my lens before we can start here.
"as a matter of fact, you can see as far north as lake michigan and lake superior."
got it.
steering right back in.
"herschel. that's right. freak. you know what's going to happen, don't you, gordon? i'll make a prediction."
okay. we copy that.
"i'm getting a quick pan of the area here to - ... down this alsep deployment - there you go. ok 20 58 07 cdr okay, man alive."
"()kay, commander audio's open."
"bob, that line of clouds i called a fir-tree pat- tern that swings up towards hawaii - hawaii, if you will - has - also has a mushroom pattern on the top. it has the appearance as if two major air masses - one going from west to east and the other form east to west - have converged along that line, and the joint movement of air at the interface being south to north. and up in the area of hawaii, i think, it tends to mushroom so that the pattern then goes back to flow from west to east on the east side and from east to west on the west side."
"okay. we're there now, jim. jim's got it. go ahead with the gyro torquing angles."
"roger, 15. those are the numbers. look good, thank you."
"... out nicely. okay, h-dot is tourding right out to the target. lmz_-lm 700 to go."
"apollo ll, this is houston. over."
"roger, dave. we're standing by."
okay.
"okay, 413. 06 02 58 25 i/4p-eva okay, tony, the bottom - the bottom core, as i said, was 36 and the top part is 20 - 9, i think; wait a minute - 29."
and we're standing by for the tv to come off.
- - controller mount is the thing that's hang - you're hanging up on. you sort - sort of have to go easy and get down past that. okay_ see you inside. 05 05 53 32 i_p-eva okay.
"roger. i sure hope so, karl; been keeping it up just for that reason."
doesn't seem to be ...
roger.
go ahead.
... rover ...
i - i did nothing up here to reacquire on the - the high gain. it came back automatically.
that's incredible.
"okay. the word from down here is don't touch a thing. 04 17 10 15 _ yes, we're in good shape. we're just going to le_e it right where it is."
water connector. 05 10 57 17 _p water connector.
"houston, apollo 15. the ops pressure is 1000. li 02 04 18 cc roger, 15. we copy 1000 on the ops pressure. _ and we have a suggestion down here that may make the ops - simpler to handle. we'd like to put the hose over its connector there and simply turn the ops on to bleed down gradually and simply replenish the cabin pressure and then you don't have to bother with you - operating it tonight."
"that's affirmative. you may. we think the light will come on at 202 oxidizer pressure and we're predicting you going to be running around 200. 02 20 17 36 cml° houston, would you like to have the high gain antenna?"
okay.
okay.
yeah.
"these prints might 'stay here, dave, so i can photograph them at - later."
"are you going to dump that thing through a filter and everything, ken?"
"i've got to get the tool - whenever you're ready, i'll get the tools off of you. i'll be packing the etb in the meantime."
very good. i have some words for you on the rcs.
"hey, you're on, buddy. you're on - you're on! ... 03 12 28 41 _ no, really. you ought to really think about it."
"okay, we're at attitude now. 04 ob 59 o1 cdr okay; thank you. 04 04 ob 15 cmp okay, falcon; endeavour. doing the trim maneuver. 04 04 ob 18 cdr okay."
"and, 13, you might also check for those pages in your launch checklist. they're emergency pages; pink pages, 1-5, and we'd like you to power down until you get - -"
"and, america, you're l0 minutes from los, and the spacecraft looks great."
"yes, we'll wrap it a little bit .... it will fit. ... fit. okay. bag 541 is partially around another big rock *** collection bag."
"okay, charlie. hand me the jett bag."
"okay, because as we come across the ..., we might see something. yeah. o0 o0 47 06 cml° okay, and that thing just gets stowed out here. here, i - i put up my little - -"
okay.
"yes, i'd believe it."
"yes, sir."
"firs_ of all, let met start my photographing. this whole area."
"... gee, charlie. 06 04 14 52 hmp-eva look at that soil! it's all cake looking, isn't _ it"
"should be flank right over here 95 12 47 13 _p just out of sight, you mean?"
"does thav snow up? let me try i% _ivk - _er me vry some cf vhese others. well, oh, here's wkere it goes."
"okay, and ... okay and go to ... there."
"you are loud and clear in simplex b, nell."
yes.
how come you're cleaning up the rover?
"roger. yes, we got them."
that's affirmative.
"hey, that brings up a question. we were wondering where you guys plan to stow the probe and drogue? it occurred to us that one possibility was to stow it in the lm, down about where the lmp normally stands, underneath the is - isaer. perhaps you have a better idea. over."
...
move this tv over - cable over here by the front porch.
okay. we confirm that. three ... core tubes is the only ones we're worried about bringing back.
and you want to - you want to review it at all?
splash.
"you want the pallet, right?"
okay. i guess we'll proceed on to station 10 and take a look at it there. i'd sort of - would like to get up to the north complex if we can.
to doff their biomed harnesses now. thank you.
okay.
okay.
"this is just a couple of notes here. the p52 stars we got in the cms are 16 and 17. gyro torquing will take l0 minutes 47 seconds, l0 minutes 47 seconds."
roger. (tm_q) (goss net 1) tape 79/7
okay. fine.
you get the other ones. thrust a and b to normal after the pro.
"houston, apollo - or houston, columbia. over. (columbia) (go[;snet 1] tape 65/6"
how much stuff there is on this sunscreen.
"what's the get, ken? give us a mark at - okay."
"here, i'll line it up."
"yeah; 95, actually. 00 01 59 l0 cml° all righty."
okay.
roger.
same here.
"there, i thought we had lost this brake here for a minute, but there it is. and that sample is going in bag sample 381, _nd i'll shoot the pan here in a second."
we'll get it to you. yes. let's get soil in this bag.
yes.
mark.
and we would like to do that before we start the uv photography.
"well, okay."
"and, 17. just be advised, you're going to have an s-ivb nonpropulsive vent start 04:18:27. you've got about 3 minutes on that."
okay. oh 10 48 37 lmp okay.
"al, wait a minute. hold it, houston. 04 23 0t 08 lmp they may be having a site handover."
what? the tongs?
"okay, fred. we're in noisy comm here; i got descent 1 fuel 66.5; stand by a second."
"(laughter) thank you, gordy."
"okay, go. z"
"okay, cabin gas return, auto. 04 2b 10 01 cdr wait a minute. 04 2b 10 02 lmp get over here. 04 23 10 0_ cdr okay. auto."
wait a minute.
yeah.
"houston, how do you read. over?"
i don't know.
okay. that sounds good.
"hank, is the high gain gonna track us to this maneuver, or should we set it manual and reacquire when we - -"
"say again, dave. when does your crew status report have them?"
"casper, we have been noting a little oscillation in the high gain at acquisition, and we were wondering if you're still noticing that discrep- ancy between the angles and the knobs when you're in the manual mode. it appears to us that it may be off a little bit in yaw."
"okay, vance. the readings that you wanted; are you ready?"
don't anybody tell ken how dirty we are.
roger.
"that's affirmative. lqp hello, gordy."
"oh, there's the sep. wait - did i miss this other rille? _p-eva yes. there's the - i'm on the antenna."

"good readback, ken."
"yes. there are two spots over there that might be outcrop, tony. there's a -"
do you have any feeling that you could get away with putting a front fender on?
... go around that crater.
roger.
seven minutes.
okay. i think that's what we did last time.

how about vhat.
roger. it's 5.6.

it sure looks like it. it was under itmwasn't it?
"okay_ jack, i know i can get up to that - to station 6."
okay.
i have a barber pole with gray.

"no, i was thinking of setting the dap."
"look at these little crystals in it. no, that couldn't be. a big, white, angular rock and it's - but all the crystals in it are very small. ·that - that is a crystal rock. we're gonna get that one. that's the first one i've seen here that i really believe is a crystal rock, houston."
"okay; it's your water consumption there, charlie."
"yes, you got one."
okay.
"that hit on the floorboard. that's okay. *** even getting dust on my helmet. boy, this is neat, really neat. okay, now between us and the survey, tony, we really drop off again down to the base of stone. we're going down about a 4- or 5-degree slope that's still, apparently, ejecta - south ray ejecta. we're down to perhaps l0 percent now on block frequency. the character of the regolith is still the same, loosely consolidated with a rain- drop pattern. it probably looks that way because _ of the sun. i'm convinced of that. the rocks are mostly grayish with white clasts in them. tape9_/24"
"i've got eons_,m_bles update, when you're ready to copy."
"okay, okay, joe, on the rover, and heading to the alsep site. ready -"
"well, there's a large one over there, too, joe, i -"
roger. thank you.
see an_thing bung?
"_ay, vance. the battery charger's off, and i'm ready to continue with ken."
"okay, tony. as i look up-sun here - going back through the - you can see these lineations, mostly furrows, i'd call them, with random orientation. and they're definitely the sun casting shadows on unconsolidated regolith."
start. 05 13 35 03 limp okay. we've got it.

"for planning purposes, what bock should the i2,_ gums have available _o write in?"

"okay, my tone is stopped. okay. don helmets. 04 17 19 4_ cdr okay."
that's exactly the truth.
roger.
"okay, 125:30:05, 126:29:55."
okay.
can't you - -
got it? whoops. can you keep it in sight here for a minute? is that it?
"okay. 07 23 14 5j4 cc 16, houston."

"that's affirmative. following that sequence, at approx - well, that time is all wrong there. but we want you to do a verb 49 maneuver to the antisolar point. that's about a 5-minute maneuver. and the attitude is 279, 223, 356."
"yes, sir. just great."
"yes. did you look at it, jack? ob 04 57 46 cmp yes. okay. but i didn't recall what ..."
roger.

"endeavour, this is houston with a forecast weather report for your landing area. they're calling for high scattered - 2000 scattered, l0 miles vis, ! winds about 15 knots out of the east-northeast, waves going to 4 feet, and we're predicting no midcourse 6 correction for trajectory reasons. and from the weather report none is required for weather reasons. over."
"no, that little - ... cap - popped off."
"well, but this - -"
roger. can you see neper from there?
"okay, vance; we've completed that procedure, and let me know if everything was okay."
"okay, stay for t-2.  eva-1 final preparation 04 23 07 20 l_p tape recorder going on."

"the met seems to be riding very well, houston. it's bouncing a little bit, making nice tire marks, but not about to turn over. it jumps about a foot every time it hits a small rise, but very stable."
"okay, challenger, you're loud and clear on the omni. how did it go?"
mm--_!
"okay, ron."
understand. sure like to keep this vehicle in the corridor though.
"there goes yours. okay, your water hose - here it is. that's almost spaghetti. 07 03 18 35 lmp-iai that thing's about 95 feet long, john."
"okay. $ervo power. go ahead and go to po0. i'll do this one. two, off."
and then there will be a 1-degree difference on the rest of the ordeal numbers.

"okay. you want mode control, both, to art hold. 05 09 ]6 21 cc that's affirm."
that a boy. which end is that? ***do i want? this is the end i want.
okay. let's take a - -
"roger, understand."
let me see. we've got one sitting right in front of us for 233:40. do you want that one? c_ i don't have that one.
right straight up is the best way to go.
"p7, p1, p7, p16_ next one coming up, fl2."
okay. i've got 2 minutes here.
"hi! jim, we - we've gone ahead and computed the csm coarse aline gimbal angles based on your being at the service module sep attitude at the time that jack cranks up the computer and - and coarse alines the imu. that is, we assume that ['age737 you're going to be at roll, 0; pitch, 091; yaw, 0; and, if you concur on that, i'd like to pass up the angles for - for ,yackto have."
"we get the general - yes, we get the general gist of that, joe. go ahead."
"and, houston, let's go to activation - or get into page 10 and see what we did there."
"man, that's a wicked low pressure down there. i wish i was on it. (laughter)."
thc.
okay. 05 22 18 03 ibip-lm okay - got a tone. 05 22 18 29 cdr-im can you reach around and hold the hatch so it _ doesn't blow shut? 05 22 18 32 i_-i_ i got it. no sweat. it's a lit - little easier today. 05 22 18 37 l_)r-i_4 getting in practice.
...
go ahead on the pad.
bob?
"yes, sir. about to get it again. there you go. okay. the stake's holding fine. adios."
"apollo ll, apollo ll, this is houston. how do you read?"
gerry griffin reports that he's already done that.
"okay, that's official burn attitude."
i got it right in the middle of the -
"... 10 08 38 34 iimp oh, that's the way they do it, yeah. man, is this thing filthy."
"you get a good look at the earth, charlie?"
i - i - -
"okay. 07 i1 14 23 cc _nd, orion, this is houston. could you tell us where you are in the timeline book? 07 11 14 33 l_ yemh, i'm putting the buddy - the bslss rock bag in the - ken's stowage thing here."
"al, this is houston. would you verify the lens is still capped? over."
roger. and i gather that alfmed must be a pretty effective shield. i didn't hear ken saying any- thing.
"boy, you sure can move on this surface."
"tony, we need to jack the mesa up and we can't get the lock off."
get it. you want to go ahead and -
"- - regarding the boulder, do you think possibly that the black part of the boulder might be a big clast in a coarse breccia? over. 05 09 12 45 c_dr-lm no, i'm not sure, joe. the breccia that was in there was glass covered, and there was an exposure after i took a chip out of it that was a breccia not unlike 14. as a matter of fact, i'd say it was almost typical of 14s, but maybe only second or third order. there definitely was a - a linear - i call it a contact. whether it might have been a very large clast inside a very large rock, there's no telling. but there was a definite line there which differentiated two types of rock within that big boulder, and i - i really wouldn't want to guess whether that was a large clast or not."
"oh, let's get those closed."
coming back on.
"okay, jim. i guess the significant point there is that you didn't notice the vibration before you saw the engine light."
i can carry them easier.
"hey, there's some of that light-colored undersoil."
this is the relaxing attitude for the world - for the seasoned space traveler.
"okay, at 268:30, delete ""charge bat a."""
... the day after.
and a is coming off.
"roger. pdo thinks you had a good solution, but not a great solution before. he's now saying that the z-component will be - should converge to about a minus 2_9. _md if it does, your approach angle will be more nominal - rather than along the horizontal."
"yeah, on that bracket. okay, there you _o. 06 06 o0 34 cdr-i2_ okay. 06 06 00 35 lmp-z_ okay."
"okay. t-start on the left-hand one there, is 213:20:10, and t-stop is 213:24:20. then the next one is t-start of 213:41:40, and a t-stop of 213:59:54. over."
"okay. jack, you're going to have to close the gate, and i'll have to hold the big hag over the top."
and we'll talk and set it up so that ...
better let him say something before aos.
"yes, but don't push."
yeah. just like in the training units. these - 03 22 il 13 cdr what?
"that's correct. and further down at 109:50, where you have ""visual target 17,"" et cetera, cross out that line and cross out the penned-in ""d17."""
"- - some more. i don't want this cap to come off. okay. i'm going to intermediate cooling. okay. now you don't have any caps, so let's take this back to the rover. t_2_p-eva where's the hole?"
wait 1. 02 10 48 29 _ what have you got? how much you got left in battery a? okay. i wish i knew what the hell they were thinking right not ... - -
"roger, al. thanks."
"okay, jack. do you want me to proceed by the scs powerdown checklist? i did not copy the scs items you wanted me to power down."
scrambled eggs and sausage? that'd be good.
"isn't that something? man, you talk about a mysterious looking place. they can cut some frames - some parts of those pictures out and make a aicc photograph. (laughter) tv cameras, maps - 05 21 11 10 imp-eva okay, lookiag at the north man - the li_ht m:mtlc. no more comments except that by that rake s_nplc and just looking, there's certainly - are fewer fragments than we saw at station 2. the main thing that we can tell about the light mantle and when we're on it, of course, is the light-colored craters. the fresher craters all aspear _o be light colored. as they get older, they seem to - the albedo goes down and potentially have been dusted with material from the dark mantle or from other sites. either that or it's just the lunar patination that we're all familiar with."
yes.
"- - oh, a third of a meter under an overhand. and it's the upper 3 centimeters of soil."
yes - -
"okay, the ags is set. hey, here comes the a0 - aos. good show. i was wrong on that."
that doesn't do it very much. got to be very
"you're not going to be able to work across the contact. but you mainly would do it by the white boulders in the ray, i think. i can see, on ridge lines - from here, i can see three different rays out of south ray, i believe. have to go down there and look at them to make sure. they seem to be riding on the ridge lines, although that's probably deceptive because i can't see down in the - i can't see down in the rolls."
you want us to dump 5 percent. is that correct?
"okay, pyros are coming on. pyro a, on; pyro b, on. 00 02 19 43 i24p okay."
"okay, al, we're just standing by for 2 minutes."
"okay, jim. that's a tiny hair shallower than we had you before, but it's based on solid track- ing, and it still is lift vector up comfortably. tare 94/13 05 _'l 51 06 cd]_ roger. we ncw._r did bring that angle up, did we?"
i'm doing that right now.
"stand up over there. there, okay."
yes - - 09 o0 01 b0 cdr - - ...? 5.2?
that's affirmative. i couldn't even find the chlorine.
okay.
"jim, we have some status information for you, if you're ready to copy on a piece of scratch paper."
"roger, falcon. we have you a minute to los. your solutions look good in both computers. we'll see _ou on the other side. and be advised: we did _tto_our ii_ff, 6n_ _ can confirm you l_fted off."
"okay. we change verb from 49, angles to 037. the other two are the same. high gain, minus 10, 244."
c_ay. record delta-v counter and residuals; ems fenction_ 0ff_ and st._2tdby.
right on descartes.
let me ask you a question. is mine tight?
"roger. 88 and 8.5. when you're ready, we've got a small flight plan update for you."
okay.
"the condition of crew *** 4000 - 3500 feet, on the way down. 08 03 16 00 hornet 11, this is hornet. copy. tl, hornet. what's your splashdown error? over."
roger.
"houston, this is hadley base, ready to copy pad - lift-off pad."
roger.
"well, i've got to - i've got to - f lmp-i_ you ... put it on the porch?"
okay. stand by.
great.
okay.
"and, 16, you're about 1 minute to los, and you're looking good."
"and, america, we'll give you a state vector if you give us accept."
5 seconds.
i'm ar. how do you read?
"tidbinbilla, is that correct?"
...
"okay. then once you get there, the high gain angle should be a pitch of minus 50; and yaw, 205. over."
"roger, karl. understand. you want that p20 turn- around done at 211 plus 40, instead of 212:00."
that yours right here? 05 20 30 24 lmp-_ ... one more time ... to make sure.
yes. jack's doing it right now.
"okay, bob, it's on the minus-z and the - one corner is facing directly into the sun."
"he's mad at us now. 06 21 52 27 imp-eva okay. the third sample is in 485. okay. whoops, sorry. *** possibility here is that the - this upper 6 inches of gray material in here is the latest mantling in the area and the light-colored debris may be what's left over from the impact."
fit - will that fit on the camera though? will this piece go onto the camera? 01 08 20 19 c_ i think that's the same kind of connection as on the - on the hasselblad.
"csm/l_ final sep, two, on."
"okay, and you really have to bear down to get those - -"
"16, this is houston. you're 2 minutes from los. 03 21 32 28 cml° okay, thank you ...."
it's easy to lock.
"okay, vance. the ems delta-v pass passive, the results of the no-bias pass in 100 seconds, have been from 100 to 101.5."
"okay, ..."
two hours.
ah me.
roger. and a good stage.
okay. that's entered.
that's affirmative.
okay.
"going to have to square a new guy away, here."
"that's true. 05 22 39 21 cdr-imm okay, start the watch. go ahead, charlie."
"now, which one you want to use? use this one?"
"not anymore he isn't. i took the tv. bob, you still read?"
2:21.
okay.
"gear box selector, unlatch."
- - rendezvous radar or anything. right?
"i'll do it from there up towards this way. okay? 05 04 54 58 lmp-_a wait a minute. okay, which way you gonna drive? from here this way?"
"go ahead, charlie."
okay. we copy that. any difference in rates between the different tubes?
roger. that's its jack. the moon is about 42.
"apollo 16, houston."
"we'll wait on that; we don't have that checklist out yet, pete."
all right. we can see that.
go ahead.
okay. how do you know when it gets to zero?
okay.
"okay. well, it's a lot more obvious today than it was yesterday; but even then it was showing pretty strong circulation. it is starting to wrap up, look very much llke therese did yesterday."
"okay, let's see. what do you think the best way to sample it would be?"
"right, charlie. why don't we just go ahead and take it dow_nslope there about your last penetrometer place?"
pdi seconds are 51.87. over.
"there's a partial pan - there's a partial pan on mag a, which was taken at 15."
roger. we copy. that's good.
"we're in average, jack."
"okay, tony, number 2 has reached the end again. i'm going to reverse it for the iast time."
"well, that's fine. we got lots of room for them."
okay. we can do that. 04 06 29 33 cm_ okay. inside of 30 seconds.
"i think it - anyway, we sampled the soil sample there, and it's in the - it's in - it's in the box somewhere. but i can't - i certainly can't remember whether it was a - white underneath or not."
"okay. that cleans up the - the checklist items. take the easy one first. and the reason we want _ to - to secure bank a during the loi burn at 6 minutes is so we can get a handle on the single bank performance, and we anticipate making all of the other burns with the good bank, bank b, with the exception of tei."
"_here's no way to tell, t. k."
"oke_v. let's see. i guess i ought to do a tei. what did you say it was, 26?"
"bob, i've got the locator of the charge and the em all ih the same order here, and i'm one more than what i just gave you. i can't look at it now."
roger.
okay.
"okay. roger. 1-2-3, 3-2-1. okay, houston, or 17, do you read houston? over."
"pete and al, can we have an emu check?"
okay.
"okay. thank you, sir. see you in a few minutes."
right. i guess so.
"when we look back at the apollo program i don't think anyone can privately to themselves and pub- licly say that this isn't truly indeed really a beginning - a beginning of man's really first ven- ture out into deep space. and once there's a be- ginning, there's a continuation. the probing into deep space by man, the next landing on the moon, a trip to mars may not be for 10 years, a decade; it may not be until the end of this century. but i personally have faith that it will happen. i think it's a restraint, an abnormal restraint of man's intellect at this point in time to restrict or tend to think that he will restrict his own feeling of exploration, his own quest for knowledge. he's had ailopportunity. he's proved that he could take advantage of this opportunity, and i think that the nature of mankind is going to just press on. that's why i believe not - we of apollo 17 - yes, it's a beginning; but the whole apollo program is really the true beginning of what's to come in the future. and i firmly believe that. we can look back in a 100 years or 200 years and the 5-year or 10-year period of time, we may be slowed down here. i think we'll be - we'll be lost in the merit of what is really accomplished during the next several decades."
go ahead.
"in getting ready for the contam_uation photography, we find that we've got a - a certain number of exposures left in the nikon. namely, we're on exposure number 29 in mag victor, and we think we have 45 total, which would enable us to complete the contamination photography with the nikon, if you desire, rather than with the dac, as you changed."
"here are mine, okay ...."
understand; we'll do that. how much does it have to be?
understand.
okay. that's my feedwater.
we'll get the sample - anyway.
"yeah, man. no kidding. lots of debris. there! some rover tracks. how about that? yes, here they are. somebody else has been here."

"i'm mounting them pretty firmly. hey, houston? as i was working around the handtool carrier a moment ago, the canvas bag came loose. it took me about 2 minutes to put it back together again; it came off the metal sides. and it looks like those clips that hold it on are going to be com- pletely inadequate, and i expect that we're going to have some trouble with it all day today. we ought to think about fixing it before next time."
right down here.
"okay, now you need to move the side on in."
never seen it fail.
"yeah, man. you better believe."
"we're not running it down here. we're just demon- strating on the demonstrator there, but stu can tell you."
"and thanks for putting me on relay, houston. - (columbia) i was missing all the action."

"okay, and we're going to cross out 3 on the bag, and put a 5 on it."
"think so, too. that just says we're going to have to use - ban - bank b this time."

"look at that one directly ahead, dave."
"(chuckle) okay. we - we'll try that, for sure. note: during the period 01:22:45:55 to 01:22:54:12, time-annotated recordings are not available."

okay; charlie.
"okay, got you. i'll try again."

"yes, i did, too."
"you getting the whole movie? i'll gev it. okay, i think you can orient yourself with the big basins jack's been talking about. there's crisiu_. you can see the landing site up in the - what is to me the upper left-hand corner of the pictures but you can pick it out by now, i know. get a better relationship. you're looking _ the langrenus_ down there, that bright craver. you ought to be able to see humboldt. maybe jack can give you the whole thing. _4p ... this in."
"apollo 15, houston."
that's all of them.
i sure am.
roger.
"okay, aquarius. you can go low bit rate, po_'_r amp, off and d0_ voice backup now. voltages and currents look normal on battery 2; so ignore the battery light."
"okay, mine's connected. okay. *** stow e_.hoses. 04 23 26 29 l_p *** in work."
and the elevation is 28. and watch the film advance as you turn the power on.
harem. after the burn.
burn time is 17 seconds - -
"that, - that card picks up as soon as i get this thing back to - get you back to normal on this - -"
"apollo ll, houston. over."
okay: scb-6.
"yes, we might as well. get it all in plus-x. okay?"
"say again? 09 06 36 03 imp okay; pete, i went to manual and tweaked up the pitch a little bit, and then went to narrow and reacq, and it looks like we've got it now."
"hey, dick, we got - got your - have you seen them?"
"okay. we're going there now. lo 08 46 lb cc okay. and we're watching the cabin pressure. it's steady again now. l0 08 46 19 k_p okay, pete. it looks about like where it's been to us. we think it's been hanging a little bit below 5."
the one with the covers open?
and save us some food.
roger.
"the walls of these craters, the big craters around here, that is, the ones that are, say, 15 meters in diameter, tend to be a little bit lighter albedo *** down in the mantled area. i'm afraid those pictures on that rake may be a little bit made - be through a dust-colored lens."
"man, is that a pretty-looking sight, that lm."
"well, it's pretty ..."
yes.
"what tv was that? okay, 13 - -"
that's affirmative. and we know we can tie those down enough to withstand any kind of reentry you might even help l over d. i don't - you know how much the in flight data file weighs? less the contingency checklist and the timeline book. and that's a total - mostly the total weight of that bag.
"okay, that's fine. i just - i didn't want to mislead you. lmp-i_ that's all right, you've never misled me before. well, let me tiiink about that."
"okay, that's right. we're at 12 minutes."
"no, gordy, i can't. the - there's very little indication of relief in earthshine and particularly at this high sun aug - high earth angle, pardon the expression."
roger. understand that.
yes. let's get ... right behind the eight-ball and get ahead. 00 00 11 05 i24p cabin pressure looks good.
"you want me to move, john? oh, okay. what do you w_nt on the dap, houston?"
yes.
roger; thank you.
don't forget the gnomon.
okay.
nice little rocks.
"you can pass the word to captain green, back there on the ti to clear the flight decks."
"okay; that was ""shutter 1"" vice ""1/15."""
roger. thank you.
"oh, excuse me. get it? 37 05 23 _$ i2,z2 go_ iv. 07 '-5 23 29 cdr okay. okay, we've got the pi,zture, hous%cn, ani we'll proceed on with the docking."
"al, say again."
okay.
"okay. and just as a brief introduction before he gets on, we're really thinking about letting jack have the broken one. nothing personal, jack, but think that it's probably more important that you and ron have the - the all-up ones. over."
roger.
okay.
"getting that thing, john?"
"roger, jack."
sure. (laughing) i don't know why - yes. i don't --- know why we always end up on slopes.
"okay. noun 20 will be plus 295.86, plus all zeros, plus 084.14."
"houston, the passive seismometer has been deployed manually."
"hank, where is that extra crater that you said you had down. there?"
roger.
okay.
okay. let's go right off to that little mound over there. how does that grab you?
"',)kay. _op row, in, all except next to the last one - next two."
"16, i've got some gyro drift updates and pipa bias for you, when you're ready to copy."
"there's pitchover. ten seconds. ok%y, haly. *** ow_r is good. pitchover. there's auto ignition. 05 21 46 iv i2,_? boy, azldhere we're going across _]at'spaw."
"okay. verb 76, enter."
i got 5700 psi in mine.
yes sir. sure did.
got a gray.
"okay. if he's able to weigh it right there, i'd like to know how he's going to do it. i assume he's got it written down, though."
"it's in the big, long one he wrote out at about ei minus 02:30. ems entry check. paga 690"
"i'd like its grid square, please. (columbia)"
"sometime you'll have time to do that, i guess, guys. i'm not sure when - -"
another one?
"roger. and after you guys give us the prd read- outs, we'd like to exchange the cmp and cdr prds because, dave, yours appears to be malfunctioning, and they'd like to have two working ones on the surface. do you copy?"
"yes, you do, you've got a different place .... over my head."
"no one in there to - shit, feels like there's nothing in there."
"orion, this is houston. are you also showing bad data on the tapemeter for the landing radar?"
"engine arm coming open and asa i guess will be open. is that correct? '?""h""' 'iill''"
"okay, what do you show now?"
"okay. !'m looking m_der ste_ 9. i gave you some ch_iges there, which included configuring circuit breakers ret the contingency checklist. 07 1! 15 19 l_ld no, i haven't done that. ! was _oi_g tc wait until i _ot my suit off. you ws_.t me to do that ncw? 07 1! 15 24 cc no, just sta_d by - - 07 11 15 25 zi{p ... 310."
m_!
there's that much dispersion in the instrumentation. you know that. okay; can we proceed?
okay.
that's affirmative.
"let's see, did i get that right?"
"okay. the next change is at 146:18, on the next page. 146:17, really, where it starts there with ""gamma ray shield - off."" delete from there through ""image motion - off."" that's delete ""gas_4a ray shield - off; mapping camera - off (t-stop), wait 30 seconds; mapping camera - standby; and image motion - off."" at 146:24 there where - in the block for msfn updates, we won't be giving you a mapping camera photo pad; instead it'll be a pan camera photo pad; this is just for your information, and it'll be copied at 148:10."
roger. we're ready 11. go ahead.
"try the high gain, gordy."
camera's stopped working.
okay.
"hey, al, why don't you take a good close look at the lens and make sure it's in the rigz_t cont_gura- tion? 04 20 02 50 _ okay, i've got it on at focus at infinity; i've got the zoom at 30 or 40 or 50; i'll put in 75; and i got the f-stop at 22."
"13, houston. go ahead."
now you got signal strength; they ain't locked up yet.
"let's start out with the cue - with the cue card, if that's okay with you."
that's a little harder to pull shut than i - -
"what control is that, jack?"
"man, 2g's felt like a ton. ll o1 42 39 cml° you're sitting on 3."
"that sure is a mighty super little platform, isn't it."
"okay, thank you. cyp well_ the beck with it (laughter). okay (laughter)."
"okay, and the volt_ge is 34.6 - 34.6 amps, slightly less than 2.5."
"okay, c._u. we're in burn attitude. looks like we're going to make the burn all right. 05 22 27 55 c£r okay. you through with - -"
"yes. got a half a tube - oooh. good, nice. you got three-quarters?"
"what's this bright one down here, kind of to the right?"
when is the next dump period?
"no. let's do that. i saw them as you go out, and then i forget about them."
"are you going to be there for a minute, gene?"
and that was just east of the - an area just east of the edge of serenitatis and probably a little bit south of the landing site.
"what am i supposed to be doing? 84:58. i'm not doing anything, just checking my camera. ckay."
okay.
...
"okay, we'll put them in bags. oh, man -"
"okay. 06 05 33 58 lm[v-eva where's your camera, john? ! need the camera."
"apollo ll, houston. we're really impressed with the clarity and the detail that we have in the picture. the colors are - now, it's really an excellent picture now that i'm looking at it on our monitor, which is about 12 seconds before the networks can get it out due to the conversion that we have here on our tv converter. we're looking at the controls in the m_in displsky console. we can see the dsky up on the panel. over."
magazine delta.
okay.
"and they seem to be quite distinct. at least you notice them. now, whether it's just a continuation of the mantling, i don't know. but - the - most other boulders - the big ones seem to be - project above the surface more than just that 5 or l0 centimeters."
okay. thar_ you.
you got - you got the etb. right?
"there may be an overhang. and look at that frag - that rack - rock is fragmented; let's see, but it's east - it's southeast/northwest. there's a split."
*** forward omni.
"okay, yours is loose."
"want to get all your mags out and stuff like that to take over, huh?"
"i don't know. let's see, maybe if we did it this way. oh, that's the way you do it, i bet you. take the straps this way like this - like this? and then snap it to the top here, because it'll - it '11 fit then."
"hey, now."
"okay, you're on the tv, jim."
yes. okay. just north of - sure can't remember those names - kyher?
"roger, houston. apollo ll. loud and clear. how me?"
okay.
roger.
good.
"loud and c_ear. oh 00 29 35 cc roger. we just barely hear you, and i have a landing site tca for you if you're ready to copy. 0_ 0c 29 _3 cdr-lm roger; can we now do the dps pressurization checkout? over. 04 00 29 5h cc roger; we're ready for dps cress."
"okay, there should be a scarp around there some- place."
"loud and clear, jack."
"ail finished. good show. tony, ain't there some way we can fix that heat flow?"
yes. pass it in.
"ccmm sounds good. 05 23 l0 05 imp-eva maybe we ought to leave the_ down. that way we won't break them off. 05 23 l0 lb cc and john, if you're picking up a rock, could you get that - - 05 23 l0 15 ia_p-eva always thought it would work - -"
- - see that little pit right over there about 30 feet ahead.
"that did it, now. ctonfidentl4"
"we copy. 05 11 06 05 i/_p okay. plss 02 is on. and 02 ;flag, clear; tone is on."
it's on.
"okay. i got two of them in there, too."
"one zero - what did you say it was, charlie?"
"the - the unlit part of the moon, as you might expect, is just as dark from here as is deep space itself."
"go ahead, houston."
"will hold that until 19 seconds, just before trim? 03 15 47 22 i_p you never know."
"okay, your purge valve apparently is serial n_a- her 197, and john's is 19h. that make sense to you? 07 09 46 09 ia_ yeah, i got it. i know which one."
"okay, and cabin repress valve, closed, on the panel."
"well, the whole thing. the lm data kit should be in there."
i didn't attempt to run any kind of an experiment - forcing the legs down. i just - just - -
"go ahead, ron."
the telescope is no different than any other time. there is just a lot of reflection from the lunar module. and even though everybody said that be- fore_ you don't quite believe it until you see it yourself.
"okay; houston, falcon here. would you give the endeavour a call. tell him we're going to run the radar checkout now, please. we seem to have lost contact."
"i can't get my head down far enough. oh, yeah, look at that. that - ken, you ought to ... up here and look at that - -"
okay.
"i'm not sure, bob, what happened. you might ask them that if you only partially get the dome removal tool on, if you can strip the whole thing out?"
"and just looking at it from here, i don't think the rover's going to have any trouble going up that hill."
"roger, al. bag 19 is the sample of the surface fines."
okay.
"aquarius, houston. you're looking good. 03 07 2_836 cdr roger."
correct.
"ttca/translation, two, enable."
okay.
"yes, because - because we kept running on the edge. we didn't just hit one. we - you can't - we all - here's how we were running, coming out of that surveyor crater. you can't do that. so, it just took one high bounce to get us up ... high ... if you don't go up all the way on it, coming down ..."
"okay. line 1, on panel 16, ascent feeds 1 and 2 will be open. and the pqgs will be open, and the ascent helium reg will be open."
"okay, i'm going to go to p00, ed."
copy that. h il 04 cdr-eva okay. i'll even get you a picture of it. oh ._-le. oh my. oh me. oh my. *** the lm from thara l_fp-eva yes.
"endeavour, at your convenience, gainstep switch to center, please. and i have the shape sps/g&n pad, when you're ready for that."
okay.
okay. don't worry.
okay. the high gain is - the high gain is tweaked.
"16, houston. at 2 minutes, looking good."
i'll bet you ...
"okay. if you want to turn over to 129:25, there abouts."
okay; figured they were. they're going in.
it's locked.
... 5-_8 _ f__l day 7
"okay, houston. my sample's in - 482 is a rock, but it doesn't look like subfloor. it looks like a blue-gray material we've been seeing, the breccia-type material. *** there's any difference."
"we can't get down to it, but take a picture."
yes. we're in tight limits ... i'm going to go a21 the way.
yes - -
okay.
"yes, let me get the gnomon."
okay. i'll go get the rest of the stuff over here. where we at?
look at my thumb.
okay.
okay.
negative. we'll have a double core - -
okay. i'm waiting for my minute and a half here.
"ken, i'll read this change up to you next time. about what it amounts to is we're going to delete the bistatic radar and in its place, we're going to put an oblique photo pass. and i - i'll catch you on the next rev with it. we got about 4 and 1/2 minutes to los."
"check south, huh, joe?"
yes.
roger. read you the same. 02 21 13 21 msfn roger.
roger. ab_0 on the cabin gas return.
yep.
"well done, troops. says when you move out from here, right? - well, first of all, we show you're 3 hours into the eva; and you're about 10 minutes behind nominal traverse we had figured out for a 4-hour eva. however, your plss consumables are holding out real well, so we suggest you go on with the nominal traverse. we may want you to cut down to perhaps just one sample at blocky crater."
"if you change that - if you change that to a narrow dead band, it will immediately fire and bring you over to the center of that 5-degree dead band. what cycling this to free and auto does is - it centers the dead band. ceonfidenti/"
"very good, al. that came through loud and clear."
"okay, magazine kk is starting with 21 pictures."
yes.
copy that.
"yes, we got ..."
"okay. c nfidenti ., ji"
"jack, did you get a pan up here?"
"hello there. how are you today? 07 02 58 28 carl° oh, not too bad; but i think we're about ready to leave. we haven't met anybody up here."
i don't know. it looks like a milky way.
"yes,a, we heard that, and we believe itts n_umber 13. 03 22 53 51 l_ verb - we concur, jim."
"i tell you that is a bigger crater than that, though."
"yes, i probably can."
...
thank you.
"boy, i'll tell you."
okay; got the old camera running.
okay. it is.
"okay. hardly nothing in the $cb, right? 05 05 48 08 lmp-i_4 one big rock is all."
yes. step on it.
right.
it's the only one around here.
"okay. jack, let me read you command module pro- cedures just to make sure i have them right, also."
"good spot right there, i believe."
"i've only got one minor flight plan and that's all so any time you're ready, don't - you know, don't tear yourself away from the window as long as you can see anything here. !"
got it?
"okay, ..."
"copy that, geno. and - -"
"okay. go ahead, ken."
(la_gbter)
"tony, i take that back. that rock we picked up, the big - the muley is - oh, i was going to say glass crystals, but take that back. _ j pa_rt of it seems to be shocked, and it's a crystalline rock on the inside under all the dust. whatever it is."
"oh, yes. let's take ... - -"
yes. doggone it.

"ail right, babe. get some lights in this thing."
how long until the shaping burn?
"roger. copy 198. and, jim, you may have dropped your sample bags."
"okay, geno, and you guys have the gnomon in the little quiver, right?"
okay. we have 02 heater tank 1 off.
huh? 05 04 25 _0 cdr-eva i've got to do this lpm.
"okay, have you got all the - got all the bags filled with tools and all that stuff?"
"jack, we'd like auto and na1rrow on the high gain. 00 19 15 38 _mi° there you go. okay?"

"looks like a good place for the solar wind col- lector, pete. i think i'll stick it right here."
okay.
"okay. we'd like a 3-foot shot of the lunar mass spectrometer, including the orifice where the breccia was. and, geno, we are observing some degradation and would like to have the high gain - -"
"yes, to the north of us."
- - i have a couple of updates to the flight plan - -
"okay. the next thing is to turn your plss 02 on, anyway."
"for a new cmp, it ain't too bad."
"for getting up and down that front ladders. the gear hadn't stroked at all. and it was, you know, practically off the surface. if i didn't have anything, if i could give a good leap, i could make it to the first rung. most times, while carrying something, i ended pulling m_self up with n_ arms to get to the first rung."
"okay, i think we'll take - a - a jab at supper here later in the day as per the flight plan."
"al, would you do a verb 66 for us?"
"counting down at 1:55. i'm on vox, and i'll give you the final couple of ste_s on vox."
okay. can you get a sudden - what switches any- where - any ... any switches on?
mark cmp.
roger. glad you're still awake. keep on looking for the cosmic rays. ll 00 46 b1 cdr looking as hard as we can.
yeah .... - - 03 04 46 40 i_vkp am i looking up north for that?
"_at, you want it set on it, al?"
"houston, orion."
"i tell you, i expended about a - i expended about a thousand ol'those when i fell down."
"yes, but look at the glass."
okay?
"okay, ken. i - i guess we'd like you to take that buffer ampoule again and screw the nut down on it so that you think it's - it's good - good and snug in there, and then put it on the adapter and see if you can - see if it'll take the buffer. before you - you close it all up again, you might look at the ampoule to make sure it hasn't cracked."
yes_ but i want to get this cable over here first.
"stand by l, and we'll take a look."
"okay, houston. last one."
music from america.
"dave, we are in such good shape on the time, we'd like for you to deploy the solar wind."
we'll get that at the end of the eva.
that's exactly what it jumped to. okay.
roger. i copy auto.
have you got one - -
"hey, that was a flight plan update we passed on yesterday. i_ve got those."
okay.
"i'll put in the pole, and i'll step back, so that - -"
i don't - how you can get the - don't know how to put a bias in. pa1g8e2 day
now i'll get yours. we got a couple of core tubes - i tell you what i'll do_ john. let me get yours off of here. 06 03 35 148 cdr-eya okay.
"yes, they're - let me ask bob here. cml° at the edge of the mountain? have they - -"
did you get the number of the other one?
"okay, my plss water is hooked up."
"that's affirmative. okay. when that's complete, the lm will maneuver to the sun-viewing angle for attitude. and when they get there, you take a mark on the sun using the sun filter and the telescope; and, again, we're marking on the center."
"well, you might as well fill it as full as you can. 5-128 __ _ day 7"
yes.
"well, let me look whenever we get a chance here."
i wonder how i'm going to do this.
"ken, i got a - a - zodical-light, mapping camera photo pads for you, and tei-32 block data."
"there's no pressure, huh?"
"okay, tony. we're going to get our suits on."
roger. we've got that. we'd like to have you climb on.
"on descent tank 2, fuel is reading 60 - okay. descent 2 fuel is reading 68 degrees; oxidizer, 65 degrees."
"roger, gene."
"step 6, the time there is not 26 plus 30, but it's 28 plus 30. also - -"
"and, you know, it's really - the - the surface is smooth, but it's pretty rough out here. smooth on a small scale, and there's lots of - you really eou - -"
ail right.
"stand by, 11. over."
"yes, it does. i put it in there a minute ago."
"okay, and did - okay, did the 100-foot tether also get into the etb?"
"last setting, right, and you should finish up there at tobias mayer w."
"if everything's okay just say, ""okay."""
what else ...... probably won't pay any attention .... 09 20 53 36 irp the only - i did listen to stu roosa on that thing ... he said get naked and be prepared to get stuff all over your hands. and it happened.
(laughter) i appreciate that.
"as you students of american history may recall, kansas caused a lot of the problem we had with those two people."
"i just got it, tony. 04 23 37 1_ cc okay, there's a particular surface on it we're interested in."
"okay, you can pull it off."
roger.
"america, houston. we're ready to give another stab on the hf antenna."
"yeah, it's in - i saw that - it's in r - it's up there in the corner in r - 10 07 40 07 latp okay."
copy that.
"yes, i would say that - i think houston is just concerned about us getting down in this crater. we been thinking about it, too, houston."
that's correct.
yes.
"go ahead, jim."
okay; fine. we - were just about to ask you on that.
that's correct. stand by 1.
"hey, the geopallet is locked on."
"roger, jack. copy that. l_p-eva still no *** structure within the dark mantlin(z material itself."
"okay, we're using system a. 04 00 52 12 _ there we go _ pro. 04 00 52 27 imp want to put these back up, john? ... there."
"okay, we've got that; 25 degrees."
"yes. okay. and i don't know if you've got an explanation on why your angles changed for the p20 business after the burn, but, this - this plane change burn is going to have a little orbit shaping in it as well as the previous one. so that it - it is going to have some components that are both radial and tangential. apollo 17 air-to-ground voice transcription"
just in general.
"yes, we keep remembering that."
stand by. we're still picking up ... high bit rate.
"okay. pull it - *** gum. we're having so much trouble with it this time. hey, you got a signal that's about - -"
"up, up."
...
"okay, re2©ezvous radar breaker - -"
okay. go ahead.
"and it's hardly got any rocks in it. john, you want to off-load mine?"
roger.
yes.
"1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2."
"roger. over on 163:10. we add ""map camera, image motion, increase"" with appropriate barber pole comment. increase, and then leave it on. ""in- crease/on'' would be a better way of reading that to you."
roger.
oh ...
"- - 34, 24. let's see. three balls - - time skip"
"houston, 15. this ought to make for some interest- ing discussion, but i guess what you want us to do is point at him and burn aft to i foot per second; is that correct?"
our measurements say that - -
"okay, *** locked."
"what do you mean, are we all for it? (laughter)"
that 's affirmative. tape _6/13
"gordy, this doesn't mean that that last 50,000 feet won't stick in my mind for a long time."
...
huh!
yes.
"okay, 16. i've got the sim bay basic configuration that we'd like to get you into as soon as we can. and i'll read them to you one at a time, and you can configure as we go along. the first one is auto rcs select, off, except al, b2, a3, c4, b3, d4."
and we'll pick - we'll pick jack and ron in the morning.
"okay, houston. the mjister a_m is os. the a and b lights are on. okay. 367 read-out and ... in 1.... , there's our boy. read you loud and clear. we're 45 seconds and counting."
good. i'll get in mine.
"ncw, you said zero, amd i gave it a ""huh"" and started off - - 03 ih 16 22 cdr yes. 03 14 16 23 c_,_fi - - on the switches."
"okay. 'i'mgoing to start right now, vance."
roger.
"well, let's get it on because we're just stand - or oboe, huh? okay."
"okay. we can see the earth out there, and it's getting a good deal amaller. it's about the same size as the moon almost, out the other window. and africa is clear this morning - at least the part that we can see, which is what's usually clear, right around from the canaries on."
"apollo 13, houston."
are you ...?
"okay, be out in a minute. got to set the camera, and i'll be right out."
"so you put my belt out all the way, huh?"
couple it.
"okay. what next, james? coarse aline?"
just what they're supposed to be doing. 03 15'52 38 cdr yes.... 03 15 52 42 _ wait a minute - let me have this page.
"okay. enter. okay, now let's - roll's fine - -"
"i swear it's a different color over here, dick. i don't think the fact that you're looking at it this way - makes any difference."
"okay, do i still have a positive closure rate?"
that's affirmative.
it's a sweet little flying machine. 07 07 58 39 _ yeah.
"we're going to fill up the other end though, so it doesn't drain out."
"i'll put it away. i'm going to dust off the mirror, there. go ahead; you - -"
"- - except that you left out the fact that it's - cold also, here."
where is it?
"okay. and we're going to cut back on our station 10 just a little bit here, and we'll skip thav photography of the heat flow cable. we'd like you to park halfway between alsep and the lm, and do a nominal station 10, except we'll drop the trench. 06 04 46 27 _p-eva john- -"
right next to your - to rover.
okay.
i'm going to dress up for it.
"oh, wait a minute. i - uh oh, just stay right there. let me get off. i get off and you ... over and get your seatbelt."
"well, i don't know. i've only worked on one so far."
- - we need the sep on - -
"okay, sounds good."
mark it.
"no, that's no problem. i just hadn't made a check with you and i wanted to make sure i was readable."
go ahead. you first.
it is.
"stand by 1, gordon."
two old compasses.
roger.
"boy, i'll tell you, it was a piece of cake up until now. i got you. *** right down the center of my eyepiece. you should have tv."
sure is strange not to see some fine-grained rocks out here. seen a couple but certainly not very many. that rock that you picked up at - *** doing up there? okay.
roger. understand high-gain angles are plus 25 and 185.
"next. cb, lm power 2, main b, open."
"eagle, did you copy columbia? (colu_mia) 04 06 18 5_ cf: eagle, houston. did you call? (goss net 1) tape 66/2 }'_ge 307 04 06 19 05 _3_ eagle, houston - houst,m, ;:sw_ · how do you read /': _c,le) now?"
i think we did!
"and, ken, to give you a few more words'on that - cancelling that subsat trscking. we're trading that off for photography - mapping camera, pan c_era, and x-ray. and we're getting 16 degrees more of the lunar surface that's never been photographed before."
"jack, you see this? this is one of those cards that - -"
"okay. oh, the temperature - they'd like to know."
okay.
"okay, we're pressurizing her now, houston."
on the ball.
you hope.
"okay. it's in the load a of the octal id of 03, which now reads 77252. change that to 77655."
"okay, at 57, it will be p20, option 5. orb rate to minus sight on horizon; noun 78s are plus 162.01, plus 40.76, and plus 184.78; noun 79s are half a degree; and it'll be an orb rate around the moon 50. okay?"
"hey, your vent flag went out. looks good, pete. oh 18 46 38 cdr oh, yes. okay."
that's correct.
"apollo 13, houston. over."
go ahead.
"houston, i can't see any stars out there, so i'm going to false torque it instead of coarse align."
"it's all up and down. we're gonna be a little close here, john, but that's okay."
roger.
and i -
"yes, i know where it is - -"
"yes, that's - yes."
loud and clear. we're listening.
"as soon as we dock, i'm going to get back up here."
sure.
"primary evap flow, two, closed. ob 17 29 10 lmp closed. ob 17 29 11 cdr descent n20 , open."
got a side lobe.
oh.
"that's affirmative. 08 06 50 57 cmld (laughter) i would suspect that you can probably throw this one back in that jett bag, too, then. there. thank you."
okay.
roger.
"man, we really touched down."
"okay. thank you, sir."
very good.
and ed fendell is hard on my back to remind you that it's better to be too far s_ay than too close.
you think that's van serg? right over there.
"roger, dave."
"okay. now here's a little fresh crater, jim - with white albedo, but i think that's probably a secondary. _-_ i don't think that's excavated or anything, do you? 06 00 59 27 imp-eva no."
and burn time? ... - - o0 02 12 05 imp 05:43.
okay. go.
"say again, john."
okay.
"yes. ob 08 28 20 cmp no, i've got another ... for that."
"yes, and will you - -"
"oh, yes, yes, we're no longer 139 miles. we're leaving."
that's correct.
- - 0.091.
"hey, that's going to be moderately level right there."
"apollo 15, houston. over."
all right.
can you give us a couple of pointing angles?
okay.
let me come and help you there.
okay.
"pretty hard, isn't it? that boulder's going to roll."
"okay, probe umbilicals disconnected and stow. electrical connector covers are closed. yes, yes_ those are yellow ones. preload handle, position against - against the umbilical connector. okay, that's done."
"copy, jim. remarkable nav system."
"all right, ken. i guess we don't have a grid right now."
b3 and c4 are both off on panel 8 and i under- stand you want - say again what you want on register 2.
"two degrees a second (laughter). 04 12 h7 00 lmp you're kidding. 0h 12 _7 01 cdr no, i'm not kidding (laughter)."
"boy, it's really giving her heck on the rcs; that must be the radar updating."
"okay, that sounds good. and regarding the question about the rover track, jim, you told us they were one-half inch deep or less, and we're wondering if that was a typical number over the - the course of the entire traverse, as far as you could notice?"
ar.
(whisper) 37 - minus 120 - 20.
"good evening, gordo. how are you doing?"
"(cough) 3o j ._u,_ iii'-iiv,. i i-, iiiii1_ ii1,,-l- iiii, i ..,i / day 1"
"but if we do something off of that, i just thought it would be nice to record it. what we found out. that's all .... ?"
"odyssey, houston. 0', 2! 0 l _,(] cml' go :jjlead."
"sounds good. 06 04 59 44 cdr-i_m houston, challenger. the 02 is complete on - 02 fill is complete on the lmps plss, and we're work- ing on the water."
"would you stand by just for a second, please? okay, hank."
i know. i can see - nothing out here. darnedest thing i've ever saw.
"yes. well, let me leave it under your seat."
water gun still secure.
you cut out. say again?
yes. i can imagine.
okay. *** fairly subdued craters now. age llconft t . ay6
made it.
okay. leave hotel on. that's - we - we goofed .... accepted.
that's where i've been putting mine.
"well - our - something doesn't look right to me, somehow. the way it's bringing this 353, which is about a minus - 03 oh 43 11 cmp why don't you zero the optics? 03 oh 43 15 cdr okay. 03 oh 43 18 cmp wait 15 seconds, then - ti7 again."
"att/translation, 4 jets."
"okay, where'd you go ? 07 05 25 30 cdh-lm we should be right where we were. have you com- pleted your _ueuver?"
that's affirm. that's a real important time.
"okay, jack. i'm kind of curious the amount of perturbations our ptc attitude is taking. y notice that we are getting off attitude, and i'm just kind of curious how far we can let this go."
"we just passed 1 minute, yankee clipper."
"okay, jack. it appears that we're going - funny diversion here, the ptc attitude in - in pitch. i'm going to do a lpd check now, but the last time the moon went around, it was above - way away above the lpd angle and i see the earth coming around now which is going to be pretty low. they oscillate back and forth, but each time they seem to get a little farther away from the center line. you might think of some pro- cedure to reestablish ptc, if itts necessary."
"roger. and ... 25 12 23 30 i_.p yes. and we're starting uphill now. climb's fairly gentle at this point, but it's definitely uphill."
"outstanding, that's better than i thought."
okay.
okay.
we're ready to start this alighment right on time.
"okay. i just wanted you to know that's the sequence you're in. okay. at the completion of that, we go back to panel 8, and it's sequential, pyro ap_4,both of them, to safe."
"well, it's ..., but it's shield on the bottom."
"(laughter) 07 l0 21 04 _ man, that's really funny."
"okay, i'll carry it up right through here."
"yes, we're wr.lking uphill, tool 05 02 39 2b lmp-eva is that ever uphilll"
"it looks pretty good, as well as i can tell without the gear extended. i can't get a real definitive answer, but you couldn't fix it any place to see much more out of the window without hand-holding it for the whole time."
"okay, bob. the gravimeter's on the surface. and you want a gravity reading and a bias reading, is that correct?"
"and endeavour, houston. we still don't have the pan camera, off, as far as we can see."
"i tell you, when we get down to 8 miles, we're gonna really look like we're down among them."
outstanding.
"okay, we're right down here now, and i can'% see that very well. can you - do you want tc read t_he- read the checklist?"
"oh, man, that's incredible."
"okay, challenger. we saw it, and it looks good. rcs looks good."
i laid it over there on the bench.
roger.
"close, okay."
"what that does for you? if you lose your attitude reference, you can go find the moon and that just gives you an idea what time that thing ought to set. and then you know where the horizon is. and you can uncage a bmag there and then pitch 30 degrees and you're - you're near it."
"roger, ron. o1 19 h9 40 cc ron, if i didn't tell you, we concur with turning the dac off there."
"okay. panel 11, top row, open all the circuit breakers."
okay. the world's biggest jettison bag.
yeah.
"okay, jack, we just thought it's about time you got a lm checkout. o_ [0 ',q_ _[, (_mt' but h_'._ giving it to me inert.

"(ls,,_ter) okay. we'll get her here."
no. excuse me.
"hey, charlie. verify the tv power switch is off."
"yeah, i know it."
okay. 04 13 39 07 lmzp ail right. that's got it. are you ready?
"ken, which pad is it that you want? those on page 324 don't - don't apply."
"yes, we - we appreciate that. there he is. big jack."
att hold. pgns are residual.
"charlie, you gonna put your foot on the -"
"oh, shoot, tony, you can do better than that. haven't you got any more?"
okay. i
...
"looky here. well, why don't you get your - well -"
"well, it's not reading the right numbers in altitude rate and it's not reading the right numbers in verb 63. the altitude transmitter is 3.2, the velocity transmitter - velocity transmitter is 3.7."
"okay, see what it did. it didn't look like to me it did. it didn't get in there."
"t/r; relay on. vox - vox sens, max; t/e. okay, houston, how do you read, now? houston, ed; how do you read?"
"okay, bob. stand by."

"dave, we're having to look at these based upon times - we don't see the contact light, and we don't really know when touchdown occurred, but we're looking at things like the times. you were coming down at .7 there, all the way to the very end; and, then, at the same that we see the pitchup and the rollover, we see an increase suddenly to 3.7. over. 04 20 24 21 cdr-ia{ oh, i see. think we might have stuck our rear paw [sici in a crater back there somewhere, huh?"
p38.
"okay, i - -"

"we copy. al, they want me to ask you once more about - tell - tell you once more where - where the location was. _ne waste management bag in a-8, but i think you know that already. incidentally, it's a rather short thing, 2 or 3 inches long. it's got a thread on one end and a quick - quick disconnect on the other."
okay.
roger.
"yeah, the sun is shining on it. this is a lousy attitude for picturetaking. are you taking pictures now? 07 09 23 36 i_p yeah. 07 09 23 48 i_p ain't gonna be doing any good with the sun shining on it like that though, john."
3.0 and i - -
it won't work? the thing ...
"loud and clear, cdr."
"houston, this is hadley base."
"yeah, don't strain yourselves there."
...
"roger. gamma ray going to retract now, and stand by on the news."
"yes, feet slightly elevated."
"dave, this - this is a metabolic curve, plain and simple. it's not a leak rate at all."
"if you've got the tv back at the lm already cut off, then there is no more need for it. 05 14 30 39 cdr/lmp okay."
how did you do on your so 1587 06 00 33 42 cmld excellent.
"okay, on the next col,mu, 180:40, delete the verb 49 maneuver."
that's general reminder number 1.
pga diverter valve to vertical ....
wait a minute. i got the most beautiful thing here. i got to pick this up - before i lose it.
"dead ahead, ken. push your rendezvous radar breakers in?"
"why don't you - yes,,get the down-sun and we'll just scoop - right here."
"we're going to wait until he calls zero, and then move the switches."
"there's a crater up there, ed."
...
])idyou lose something? 05 14 _8 20 cdr you lost you kno_ what.
... use the delt&-v anyway.
"okay, the lmp. we suggest he makes a check. put his audio panel, vhf a t/r to t/r. and we're going to have a1 initiate the check. he - he's kind of busy as he passes over, so he's going to initiate the check at a slack moment, and that'll be some- time between 108:32 and 108:44. 04 12 18 03 cdh-lm okay. a couple of points. we don't have any mis- sion timer, and we'll be standing by. and i'll have to do it, because we have one lightweight headset that - that would - that failed right when we picked it up after lift-off when we first unstowed it. we brought it down so a1 could have a good one."
"oh, okay. yes, let's press on."
"stand by. roger. let's go ahead. 07 06 23 29 cdr-_ okay, you got 1.4 on the agc, transmitter power is 3.4, shaft error is 2.1 to 2.65, trunnion error is 2.2 to 2.65."
"roger. boy, it's just beautiful up here, looking out the window. it's just really fantastic. and the thing worked like a gem."
"water sep component light, on?"
roger.
let's put it like this. down like that. 0_ 21 53 33 cdr don't fall over. 04 21 53 35 i_mp okay. there's no way.
"yes. lnp-lm not halfway, just enough - -"
yes.

i can't get at it right now.
"okay, can you get that by yourself?"
"okay. suit gas diverter, egress."

"it will be .... okay, it is now."
huh.
"that's kind of the way i thought it would be. but, unfortunately, we're looking behind us."
"readback is correct, and be advised that cross range number means you're going from south to north. you'll probably see some roll during the pdi."
"yes, the whole freaking thing is empty except ..."
that's two thousand - 19377
"okay. and, charlie, 39."
"okay, gordy. that little storm - fairly big storm - that was off the coast of northwest africa yesterday, has moved inland and presumably is giving those people up there some weather. might even be getting some snow up in the atlas mountains. it's still fairly well organized and inland a few hundred miles - or the edge of it is inland a few hundred miles. the people at the cape of good hope ought to be seeing some clouds that are forerunners of a large circulation system that's south- southwest of them- that, although large, it seems to have most of its heavy clouds to the southeast of the center. and they may not get any major weather out of this one. but they'll probably have cloudiness for a few days. the storm that was over buenos aires yesterday has apparently moved out to sea and is now west - or east- southeast of that area. otherwise the - except for those three storm areas, the south atlantic looks relatively calm. the zero phase point is now off the - east coast of south america, and it looks fairly dull and gray. and i suspect no ex- tensive choppiness in that area."
"should be. 2-10 day 5 oh 08 05 09 lmp look at the earth coming up over there, dave."
"look at that big hole there, jim. are we up on dune? yes, there's a rampart over there."
"16, houston. we show you 55 percent on the waste tank. i'll give you a call at 50."
"nothing i can see - but me. 05 06 ll 09 lma°-lm okay, cabin repress?"
"hello, endeavour; hadley base. hey, we're doing just fine. how are you doing?"
stand by.
"okay, 16. on those numbers you've got on the dsky there, if you'll go to the g&n checklist, page 9-4, you can load register 2 and 3 in column bravo, lines 4 and 5."
the pictures ought to pin down its - at least the end of the boulder track pretty well.
"jack, about how many s_peres of lm power will this 15 hours ...?"
"say, dick, we just passed 5 minutes."
"i was in high bit rate for the burn, (laughter) because we have - we missed that ags .... - -"
"yes, i'm still working on it, gordo. i was just deciding whether to spin minus or plus; but i guess we ought to spin minus, as per the flight plan."
"okay, houston. the probe is installed. we'll get the hatch in now."
"check your magazine, when you get a chance."
"have to pull it on. the n-pack, too."
okay ....
"okay. we just still put in a strong vote for north ray. it looks accessible, and there's a tremendous block up there we'd like to look at."
"and did i hear you say image motion, ofw?"
look at noun 65.
"yeah, i did - for turning on."
okay. plus 0.1. 01 06 39 52 _ okay ....
you'd better take a picture of it.
... want to go out to this ... point of this - -
torquing angles.
"okay, go ahead."
"i can't do it from here, john. looks like to me you got to go right. or down, to you, i guess it is."
0mni delta and you were cut out. i never got (columbia your coordinates on estimated lm position. over.
it's all yours.
enter. can i do this?
"isn't that pretty over - can you see the massif, too?"
"well, that's - not _ust now, no."
"roger. our guidance recommendation is pgns, and you're cleared for takeoff."
"okay, gordy, understand that; and apparently this time, had i let it - had i waited a little longer, it would have dropped to zero and then come up, because that's what happened when i finally got you. i'll give it more time next time."
"could i interrupt you, ken? 05 07 39 h7 cmp - - and the - you don't have deep crevices. go ahead."
i tho_ght i was going to get this half.
"okay, your readings are 180, 088, 2.0, 1.4, 115, 115, 115. amps are zero. volts are 70, 68, 68, 100, 100. rear motors all scale low; forward motors all scale low."
okay.
"suit fan delta-p, open."
"capped, bottom section."
"okay. i copy that. okay. while we're talking about this and i'll get back with you, turn the dsea and the receiver both to off, please. and read me a temperature, please."
okay.
"hey, they've got automatic disconnect just like those fuel cells. it's not like - it's not llke this thing, here. we got those ... controls and everything."
"okay. #4* more time. your helmet is locked, purge valve, locked. ### #** that's locked; *** locked. ### let me see - ### see. sure and that's locked."
okay.
"okay. very good. thank you, sir."
"you-got omni delta, gordy?"
"roger. this is a news report to eat by. i'll combine an orbital science report with a sports report, an unusual combination here. i'll start out with a sports report on monday night football, which you may not have heard yet. joe na_ath triedmightily to lead the new york jets into the american football league playoffs, but the oakland raiders grounded the jets in a fourth quarter 24 to 16 blitz. namath passed for more than 400 yards but, in spite of it, new york scored only c_e touchdown. moving along to the successes of captainamerica, i'll run down different items in the sim baa here, beginning with the uv spectrom- eter. in general, the data has been excellent. we're getting indieations that the hydrogen atmos- phere of the moon is m_ch less than expected. in fact, i don't think we're detecting any, but rather setting a limit on the amount of hydrogen around the moon. there was an aerobee launch - an attempt at an aerobee launch - from white sands on monday to calibrate solar uv radiation, but this launch failed because an instrument viewing port in the rocket failed to open. a second launch - let's see - was scheduled, i think, for today, and i don't know whether that was success- ful or not. i guess it'll be launched later today. the infrared scanning radiometer is per- forming beautifully. indications are that subsolar-point surface temperatures are higher than we've detected from our earth-based observa- tions before. we're seeing many thermal anomolies, particularly in procellarum and in the procellarum area wear of copernicus. and we're seeing also a few unusual cold spots, which apparently are indicating areas of very fine soil with a few or no blocks in and on the soil. the lunar sounder data is beautiful, and the power monitor signals we find correlate with the surface features. and the hf data indicates to us that we are detecting a variety of layers in the mare areas. 06 0_ 16 52 lmp-lm joe, this is jack. do you know where specifically they're seeing the hot spots west of copernicus?"
"i think that's r:[ght, ken. 04 01 40 41 c_ i'm sorry, gang. i don't know what to do with the darn thing. it's - it does it both when the cmc drives it and when we drive it. i started it, restarted it, and it's - it's apparently really in the servo loop."
"well, it was off and on for me. i must have been ..."
i got it right here - -
and it's blue-graywith light colored - -
(laughter)
"okay, jack. let's keep the water; no need for a dump right now."
"roger, good night. e_o of tape tapes 42-45/1 apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription rest period - no communications apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription"
get one right there.
"there's number 2's off; number l's are off. normal powers are off. do you have the attitude, houston?"
best way to catch those would be look up on ...
okay. give me a call when you start to retract.
- - 78.
"[6, houston. are you gonna get to the mapper in little bit?"
okay. the gimbals are nice and steady.
okay. could you tell?
"okay, that sounds like good news. i'm going to start with our general rationale for the 6 and one half hour eva we 're coming up on here, and then i'll get down to some details. i won't give you all the details of the traverse right now, but a lot of them i think we can pick up as we go along, depending really on what we see as we travel along. basically, the eva will last, as i said, 6 hours 30 minutes, and this is based on our experience from yesterday. consequently, the eva-2 traverse distance has been shortened somewhat to provide good geological exploration with a minimum of travel time, primarily at the front. we're going to strike out for the front first, just as planned; however, we're going to skip station 4 for the time being, range along the front, and we may very well pick up station 4 and its corresponding activities on the way home. we're looking for craters like spur crater and window crater, but i'm using these only as examples of craters that have plainly excavated front material for us, and have provided a variety of fragments to sample. we want to return to the lm with about i hour and 30 minutes remaining. and dave, we're going to ask you to invest some few more minutes on the drilling activity; we've got fairly detailed procedures for you to follow, and i'll go into those when it seems a reasonable time to do so. jim, at the same time, we're going to ask you to carry out some miscellaneous tasks around the lm - while dave's out at the drill site. and finally, with about 45 minutes remaining, and this is a one-time-special good deal for you, jim, we're going to carry out station 8 activities in the vicinity of the i24. in other words, we will not do our station 8 activities on our homeward- bound journey from the front. now i'll stop here and ask for questions, and then i'll go into some more detailed rationale for the way the traverse will break out later on. over."
"got it. just a second, i'll be right with you. you can carry this plss around for 29 hours. al- most feels good."
pemember mr. kepler?
"okay, ron. white sands just called us and they got a good data take and their - preliminary report shows a good report on aerobee."
yep.
"okay. now, we got more samples than we've got sense - i think. let's see here - you got - you're taking care of the sep."
"okay, this is sep. that's at 102:30:00; attitude 000, 357, and 000."
"- - the noun 49 you have there looks good to us. t2_p-i_i okay, i checked the inverter. you can pull inverter 1 breaker."
"okay. boy, you're dirty all the way to you knees. can i give you any help?"
"okay. mode control, two to att hold. well, we just keep going, i guess."
"okay, jack. we read you loud and garbled just like last night when the antenna was stowed."
"yes; a couple of interesting things, we have reflection off the command module apparently from earthlight. and it's sort of tough to track the star with the command module dead-banding, but seems like if you get the star in the crosshairs, why, the optics take care of it for you. - 04 03 12 03 cc copy."

"all right. turn to psge 25. on page 25, omit step 3; perform step h. on step 4, last line, scratch ""cb(16) eps: inverter 2, closed."" over."

"they're fresher ones_ okays letvs see. we're going to picard and then on up to - yerkes - where's yerkes? there it is_ okay. letms see where we're aiming at_ here. okay. is it about time, does it look like?"

look at that guy creep up.
"apollo 11, this is houston. we are re,_eiving your fm downlink now. we are standing by for tv modulations on the signal."
"no need to apologize. the flight plan says alfa; we're just going to charlie, which is the best antenna."
roger. okay. we're just standing by.
"no, i know what's the matter. shit, i - freaking around with that stupid co_. now, he's got it. ail right, will you write this number down?"
okay?
yes. yes. stick your hand straight down. towards your knee; that a boy; you ought to have it.

{}kay.
"well, we've got a - -"
"and the remark that goes with that, you don't need to write this down, but the t-start time is biased 10 seconds prior to when we really think sunset will occur. if you see visually - okay, my mistake that's - the time is 10 seconds after sunset, but if you see sunset visually, you can go ahead and proceed with the uv cover, open, as soon as you see it. but we'd like you to close the uv cover exactly on the t-stop time as written. over. c_p okay. let's see. i'm with you. we'll make sure it gets closed at 61:26:47, but we can open it as soon as sunset comes, okay? even though we haven't started pitching yet."
roger. starting now. 05 06 21 42 cdr-i_m you're already - okay.
"okay. 17-1: 112:50:52, 55:42, 57:22, 58:10; north 02."
"okay. with the binocs on the area now, i'm looking down into north ray crater and south ray and the interior structures of those two don't look quite the same. there's a lot more light and dark material in the south ray; but that may be caused by the fact that it's just a- it really has been a fresher-appearing crater all around. the areas - trying to see if i can see any shadows or anything - there's a bright spot down there, but i think that's just a double spot itself. i don't see anything with the binocs that i could say i could see - i can't stabilize them quite that well. coming down the traverse route from - where they're going across survey ridge - i don't think survey is going to be easy to spot. and when you get down - there is one definite terrace - looks like the - looks like stone mountain is formed with one, two, three terraces, but they are much larger than the kind of things that we were drawing on the map. the rest of that is very fine subtle lineations. the area around north ray, particularly up along the area that they were going on the eva - i can see it now, and it almost looks like that little pile of material that runs up to the south of their track and i'll give you some coordinates on that. i'm looking at my chart a - oh, let's see, 9 charlie - yes, let's look at chart 9 charlie. and there's - this is a pretty lousy picture, but if you'll remember at a point about cy by 79, if you'll draw a line there and then draw a line down to about cu and 81, that's a - that represents a ridge, which shows up in the photographs. and looking down on it vertically, that looks like sort of a flow of material that runs up over the lip of north ray and down into it. and it shows some craters on it, but it almost looks like a flow that runs up and down into north ray rather than being some of the other kinds of things we've talked about. and i didn't have much time, i'll try to concentrate on that on the next rev."
okay; yes.
"yes, bob. ready to copy lift-off values for t-38 through 41."
we're in p67. 12 07 o1 12 cml° good.

"america, houston."
"here's the water gun. this cylindrical thii_g on the end of it is a filter with several mem- branes: one allows water to pass, but not any gas; the other allows gas to pass, but not any water. so, by routing the gaseous _v_ter which comes from our tank through this fill.er, we're enabled to drink purified water without the gas in it, filtered water. and, of course, all we do to - to get it started is just pull the trigger."

that's affirm.

"okay, bob. that storm off the - just off the southwest coast of new zealand is still intensi- fying and has both high and low level clouds as you can see by shadow lines. it looks like it may go into pretty - pretty fair storm system. borneo is very clear today; and, as is the_phil - ippines. and as i mentioned, there's a - looks like a very strong frontal system that stretches from, oh, let's say, the south coast of - or southeast coast of vietnam up - up between and across tai - between the philippines and taiwan and across taiwan. and right along, and i can't tell i think, just off - just south of japan. i can't tell whether japan is in the front or not. i'll look at it some more. the strongest storm center that i can see on that is - is way north, and probably - hokkaido is - has a fair amount of weather from that storm system. there seems to be a tropical depression just north of borneo. a very strong circulation system north of borneo and, i guess, just south of - of vietnam."
i don't know how - can get over there to -
"look at - look at this crater in here. we're coming right up on it now. l_p-eva yes. there certainly is a change in the general albedo, particularly in the craters. the craters are much brighter in their walls than we've seen before."

that's correct.
"well, i can't - i really wish i knew that geography. i don't know - i wish i'd thought of bringing a good map of antarctica. could somebody do a little researching for me and see if they could tell me if we're - have a little american view - say on the eastern edge of the continent?"

"yes. yes, fred. it's in the etb now."
"and, al, we're working a state vector up-link for you. stand by a minute, and we'll get a decision on that."
"jack, i got a quick agricultural explanation of the problem. (laughter) evidently, it's the two plates betweenwhich the beam itself is suspended are adjustable, so that - by ground command, so that by driving these plates back and forth, they try to center the beam between them. and then the - the data is initiated. when the beam vibrates be- tween the plates, it changes capacitance, or at least that's the general principle. and the problem is that by drive, they can comae-nd the plates back and forth and stop the stop, but they cannot get the beam to leave - leave one of the plates. it just is hung up agains$ one plate, and this would - could be caused by one of the wires that's sus- pended - sort of hang the beam, pendulum-fashion, being broken so that it has cockeyed off to one side. i guess that's the best guess as to the malfunction at the moment. it's presently in use as a seismometer returning data in that mode, but useless in its prim-wyintended data-taking mode. over."

sure. you may have a hasselblad. what would you like?
"well, i think, we said - the rake sample is prob- ably going to tell the tale there. my _ess is from the boulder - boulders and subfloor around up there that - are of gabbro and maybe the sculp- tured hills are a version of the subfloor rock. i don't think that the orthopyroxene anorthosite rock was necessarily indigenous _o the sculptured hills. it was glass-coated and permeated by glass so i suspect it may have been thrown there by an impact somewhere else."

"yes, that's - that's right. we're not on a flat plain; it looks like it slopes down from the - the swan range over there into the rille, and then when you get to the rille rim, there's another slight break-down to a sharp break. the slight break goes, maybe, 50, 60 meters, and then you drop off steep into the rille. it doesn't look like we're in a - a basin so much, although if i look to the left, jim, i can see a rise - up to the - the rille."

"okay. i tried to get hank to send this up, but he wouldn't touch it either. i guess we'd like john on the biomed today and charlie on it tonight. and just a reminder, for today we'd like items 5 and 6 in the crew status recorded."
okay.
"and i can see a lot of the - that little crater that's out to the west of lassell c, the one that looks like it has a little cone ***, is very obvious now that the sun's come up higher; and it's - it does look a little different, but there's so many of these little craters and little mountain things that stick up through the floor of the mare that it's not real obvious that that's anything out of the ordinary."
okay.
"orion, this is houston. i read you very, very weak. we wan_tyou to go to po0 and data. we're gonna send you some up-links, _d we do not want you to trsmsmit until the up-links are complete. 04 06 13 17 lm_°-lm understand. we have p00 and data."

"yes, sir. got it. okay; the brush is going to be under my seat pan."
"jack, i'm going to park - -"
roger. i'd better clarify that cabin mode a little bit there. what we mean is you go ahead and stay in the cabin mode. helmets and gloves on are your option. and we really have no concern with the co2. over.

"okay, we are goingto be a few minutes here. we got to put some lcg plugs in our suits, and it's going to take probably about l0 or 15 minutes to get all that done."

"bob, do you read?"

what?
"roger. i'm in a good attitude here to do - i have in the sextant this last p52 star, star 37. is that all right for the optics calibration to save some gas, or do you want to go over to star 40?"

"okay, the telemetry here - the telemetry is good. and we can read from the transducer that you're reading mour oxidizer tank pressure; we can also read from the inlet pressure transducer, which you can't read on boar_. the inlet pressure transducer indicates that - nominal decay and pressure due to helium absorption by the oxidizer. and this looks just like all the other flights. the other one is the one that you are reading, and it looks like it's locked up. the reason f_r the procedure that we've sent up is to make sure that we know the pressures in the lines before this burn, which will give us a baseline to plan the management during the loi."

"i'm sure it does. we noted some comments when you were rolling along today - and reading between the lines from time to time. 06 0_ 23 59 cdr-lm actually, joe, for good long spans on the run up to station 2, except when we had to pick our way up the hole-in-the-wall, i was _mning full bore at anywheres from, i guess, what'd i say, l0 to 12 to 15 clicks. i didn't hit 15 going up very much. coming down i did, but it's - it's really a ""stand by for turn and watch where you're going"" type of run. because the small craters, - of course, are the ones that can really jolt you. but the trouble is, you can't - you can never see what's just over the next ridge, and the next ridge maybe 20 meters away, and you just can't see it until you're there, and you don't know whether its a dish crater or pit crater."
"okay. terminator' s coming up _ geno. we got lights and everything we need? l_-lm ags looks; good. c_ challengers america. i don't see you in the sextant yet. but it's probably because of sun shafting or something. l_-lm 0kay, anytime you want them. okay _ ready? 1857 cdr-i_m hello, houston. challenger has a visual on _merica at about 112 miles."
yes. why don't you come up here - -
"pete, could you hold - hold that a minute?"
"it's between - it's halfway between those two large boulders and one way down. 05 13 46 57 lmm' yes, i think that's right. uh-huh, that's the one. 05 13 47 o0 cdf: okay. 05 13 47 09 cdf okay. these rocks - these boudders in - in this field here appear to be very weathered, obviously not by atmosphere but - but eroded by some process, because they all show cracks. they show evidences of being broken up either by impact or subsequently. and it looks to me as though these rocks are really pretty old."
there's pcm in low.
"nothing's in the bag, is it? big bag?"
()kay.
"aquarius, we see your glycol temperature gettin£_ up there. if you want to make it a little warmer, or you can try putting your suit temp valve to high, ii'you haven't already got it there."
"okay, go ahead."
roger. and we're showing 2 plus 30 left in the eva.
"well, that's got it - it ain't going anywhere."
okay. diverter is pull-egress.
roger.
yeah. that water cooling is what does it. why don't you - why don't you -
i don't think so.
it's probably going to be a bagful of soil when we get it back.
... for these? ohl ...
"you're right, again."

"charlie, could you copy our music down there?"
... right-hand ...
**'4.91.

"houston, 14 - kitty hawk."
okay. 0b 06 37 49 cmp can you reach it?
"wast a m_inute, i've got to close the repress valve. you g_t it all right. okay, it's closed and i'll get where i w_s yesterday. cdr-i_ okay."

"think you've had enough booster briefings, h_?"
"yes. hey, we were up to about ll or 12 clicks on that last burst."
"you kuys did all the work today. i tell you, if we ever _et a chance to look out that window, it's gonna stand you on your ears. that earthshine is as spectacular as any of the other things, which is much to my surprise."
roger.
"okay, i'll put it in. come on over. you start the lpm, and i'll be over in just a minute."

"okay, tony. i - i put the - stuffed the geophones stake in, by just pushing on it about - oh - about - a foot. you - y'all better think about that two-tenths cone penetration; it stopped 10. it looks like the 5 would be the best all the way out. i think i'11 just go right up to the hilt with it, too."
"no, ... 15."
i concur.
"no, i want to make sure it doesn't. the momentary switches, unless they got - unless they have solder balls in them, you can't go. that can't go without a solder ball."
"okay, tony. i'm going to be taking the scbs up ontc the porch."
"yes. houston, i wonder if you're accounting for being a bit off the bellyband here, and i've gone through gasta."
"roger. be zieve we understand down as deep as 3 inches, did not hit any hard bed, and no significant changes in composition to that depth. next question, the - the second src was packed rather hurriedly due to the time limitation, and wonder if you would be able to provide any more detailed description of the samples which were included in the second src. over."
okay.
okay.
"america, houston. we're back with you after some site changeover. how do you read?"

"okay, i'm opening all the battery covers. the batteries are not dirty. i 'ye been dusting the covers every stop."
"that's a massif there, too."
"okay. lmp lunar battery, off/reset, barber pole."
"no, sir, i already got it."
"and one way to locate it, also, is that it should be right on the rim of surveyor crater, and you ought to see surveyor off directly to the north- east."
"hey, great. 03 03 27 20 i/4p one on. and houston, aquarius."
"good. - that schroter's valley, you know, and was once known to glow red."

"yeah, uh-huh."
"okay, the things i'd like for you to look at are - you remember on the aft shelf of the sim bay, there's two booms back there. the one on my - the mcst- plus-y one is the mass spec - it's got a white cover and it - it's kind of a rectangular shape cover. the one on the left or - it's really in about the center of the sim bay - at the aft end and it has a silver cover and that's the gamma rs_. would you take a look and see if either of the covers are not quite closed because we have irdications in the spacecraft that they're not closed and indications on the ground that they are."
roger.
"okay. wait a minute. you're going too fast, here."
okay. just a second let me mark that up a little bit.

roger. go ahead.
"no. 10 08 24 09 imp i'm gonna take this cabin fan filter off, okay?"
"okay. wait a minute now. let me see if we got everything here. gimbal motors, four, off. okay. main b."
"no, they're both in here, joe. and i called them both out. both tucked away in etb."
"no. he didn't want it. there she goes, gang. the moon."
"okay. there's a latching mechanism in the thing there that should have released when the thing was unstowed, and we're going to try to have you take a picture of it. there's a lever that pokes out there, and we can tell from the picture whether that lever - whether that latch released. and there should be a little bit of flop in there so -- --"

okay to rush?
you want it on the h_nd tool carrier?
"yes, sir."

"ail right. t'm not too sure what tlleventing is going to do to us so - when th_s stfe tank ruptures, what it's going to (io for us. oh 12 25 47 c_,0 roger. we don't prese'lt]y expect the s}h_ _qfit to have any e_fe(:k on zour traject_o,ry,,,; ami the pressure's up to 1921 now. oh 12 25 59 cdr hey, it's going a lot better than we ever expected. what a way to get a data point."

not yet; we'll get it.
... seconds.
okay. lexan shield; got it.
huh?
"okay, and for your information, the ptc looks good° it ought to hold."
that's a big crater.
15. roger.
okay.
"all right, houston; pgns minimum impulse hot fire check. guidance control, pgns; verb 76 enter; no dap on. okay. we need to close our breakers. okay, my four are closed."
"i've got a little piece of glass right there. i can get up the hill to it. think i can put that in there? see that beauty? oh, i'll hold the hammer. okay; don't want to drop that one. but not - put in some soil."
we're back with you.
"hello, casper. how's it going? 07 03 05 05 _p oh, we're still here. done all our chores. got your sim bay buttoned up. we're in couples; and, in lieu of anything else, i just switched to wide dead band just - because it didn't seem like there was any reason not to."
good. you get mine?
what was this ...? 00 02 34 52 i_p ...
"okay, here we come. entry pad: mid-pacific, 000153; 000. the next two lines will be the get of moonset and the moon-check attitude; 142:38:17, 178; noun 61, minus 21.66, minus 165.37; 06.7; 36211, 6.51; 1168.9, 36292; 142:40:40; 00:28. the next four are n/a; do is 4.00, 02:04; 00:17, 03:22, 08:14; 33, 353.1, 29.9. boresight star is sigma libra, down 08.8, left 0.4; lift vector up. comments: gdc for entry alinement, stars 31 and 23. the roll aline 041, pitch 245, yaw 024, use ems nonexit pattern. maintain moon-check attitude until moonset; then go to entry atti- tude or track horizon with the 36-degree window mark. last comment: constant g entry is roll right. over."
"okay, bob. that last 6 inches, i really came into something hard; but it's down all the way."
okay. the pressure looked good there. we'd like that breaker back open. the master alarm you have is normal.
okay.
"okay. what we can show you now, a little added benefit, we've got the drogue on fred's couch in the command module right now. we stowed it temporarily while we're checking out the - out aquarius and underneath his couch, we've got the probes stowed. quite a big cumbersome device, and we'll get a shot of it for you."
"go ahead, jim."
okay ....
okay. seems to me like you'd like to - mambe leave it in the same attitude.
"in case we don't get comm before the burn, and at this point you're go for the burn, the only thing you haven't done is look at your target load. you still have to enable the jets, according to the flight plan, and when you do your pre-sps burncard on the sim bay, you'll be turning the alpha particle and x-ray off and going to boost on the pan camera."
"boy, this brush is getting harder to get on and off too. but i sure don't want to lose it. man, i may start putting that under my seat. well, zap me with a little cold water. okay, the sep has been dusted. i think i gave you 102 or some- thing like that. l_-eva fantastic, sports fans. it's trench time. you can see this in your color television, i'll bet you."
"that's affirmative, jack. okay, at 85:44, over there on the right where it says, ""loi refs_fl_at attitude,"" change that - ""roll 064, pitch 135, yaw 005."" over."
go ahead.
"plus 69, plus 51."
mine ....
"11, houston. did you call? over."
"now, when you're standing over the rover there, could you read off the heading?"
"okay. could the van serg breccias correlate with the blue-gray material at cochise? 07 02 56 40 i}{p-lm that's possible, i guess. but my first guess would be that the blue-gray at cochise was blue- gray subfloor. and, well, i don't know. that's a good question. that's a good question. we - maybe with the pictures we have, we can work out the - an attitude - approximate attitude on that contact that i talked about in cochise, and see if it would project over reasonably to van serg. i wouldn't be surprised if it would. that's a good - that's a good point. to me they looked very similar."
photo 1 has ... zero zero.
"let me tell you, bob, i've got to go cross-slope some of the time because the rover is really working to go uphill now."
"okay. 06 04 29 45 ia_p-eva i'_'s back to the lm. right, tony?"
"we're pretty close. i'll go up on the rim, gene, and see what we've got."
240. are you not reading him?
roger. we missed an 0mni switch there. over.
"and you ought to verify both, i guess."
"okay, real fine, and we estimate the next yaw maneuver should start at about 68:02. over."
"yes, so far everything - particularly the zodiacal light and the gegenschein calibration and that sort of thing has been going just as per flight plan."
okay; .375 in noun 79. apollo 15 air-t0-ground voice transcription
... now?
"how about a double core here, joe? got any ideas on that one?"
"well, we ain't there yet, babe. we got ... to do it. a couple of things you got to do. 00 02 17 17 cml° a couple of things you got to do."
first scoop?
okay s good enough° c$_p really it's the hour 195_ you know.
"okay. ready, go. cross off a."

"hadley base, houston."
"man, i wouldn't be surprised! wait until you open the hatch."
have they powered up the mission timer - the event timer?
"i'm down in a - oops, another crater hole (laughter)."
"hey, if y'all will turn the voice/ranging off, maybe we can get better comm."
"that's an interesting thought, joe, but i think we all know that somewhere, someday, someone will be here to disturb those tracks."
okay. it's safe and in. lock's in and rides [?] low. pin's in; it's good. tape77a/9
"casper, houston. how do you read?"
roger. go ahead. ofer.
copy that.
"okay, i'm gonna run over, tony, and look around and see if i can find what you want."
"yes, but the rake's next, as you might imagine. geno, now this - this looks - this stuff here looks a little less vesicular. why don't we try that one?"
yes.
"roger; we have an update to the flight plan, if you guys are ready to copy."
"okay, i'll try to get it in this bag, then. it'll be a heavy bag. i think i'll wait and put that in the - bslss bag."
"15, this is houston. could you give us a comm check, please. 08 21 58 -- begin lunar rev 70"
"let me undo this before i pressurize. i'll strap them in again. cml° how you guys - always got it before, but i must be laying in a different way here."
columbia's reacquired you. (columbia)
roger. they still would like to know the start and stop times.
go.
"yes. yes. excuse me i second, will you?"
okay. we understand.
"and at 189:57, ""charge battery a."""
i'm ... in ... 38.8 ...
"roger, gene."
can you yell what part of the earth?
"you're still loud and clear on - on d, fred. stand by 1. 02 02 _31 ill i_{p okay. i'll put her back to omni b if you all want to take command again?"
yes.
"orion, we w_nt you to go to downvoice backup."
"al, this is houston. would you confirm that you're at f/22 now?"
"oh, man, does that - that velero get tough. lmp-eva_ here you've got a core cap dispenser."
"okay. i'll go over and take this off, then."
"what, that over there?"
you're getting dirty.
it's over the valve.
"roger. and right after that, put ""p30 - p-30."""
okay. go ahead.
"i think that's a negative, ed; i used option 3. stand by 1 and i'll check."
"and, dave, the fine tune heading is 279."
"yes, i can just barely hear you."
am i?
"okay, they are in."
"(laughter) yes, they're so uniform in width. 06 02 21 44 i_mp-eva yes. 06 02 2t 45 cdr-eva nothing we've seen before has had the same - thick- ness of each bed. yet those are - -"
oh. it doesn't cut at all?
say again. 04 10 27 50 cml° does the plot board show me over albategnius?
- - ... light clamps.
i think that goes somewhere like a-9 or something.
"north of kepler, there?"
"... 03 l0 52 57 lnp yes, sir! ..."
"houston, aquarius."
mark.
what? my water flag is clear.
okay. thank you.
"(laughter) okay. verify that your plss antennas are up, and could we have 'an _u check first chance? and john, if you're out picking up a rock, you might - -"
yeah. but i don't want to - -
"and, jim, we see a program alarm in there. we think it's just got to do with pulling the updata link circuit breaker - uplink too fast."
"we're ready for the memory dump, charlie."
"say, bob. give me that bearing and range again for the - - i_mp-eva 70 right here."
there's a small one come floating by and it looked like flakes. and i think i caught three of the four sla panels going as we were maneuvering. i've got one out the hatch window now. it's quite a ways out.
...
"and i'm going off of csm comm, and i'll be coming at you before long on s-band, if i can."
roger. after the p52.
"yes, sir."
"- - to do is to go back to the rover and pick up the rake samples. go ahead, jack."
"okay, al. verb 06 - 6 - verb 06 noun 65. i'll give you a mark."
"fredo, could you give us an idea of about what time we should arrive at weird? how much more time?"
"yes. but, you want to have a few .,.?"
"say again, john. okay, we've got a plan here at the end of the eva to move it back. do you think it will stay out of the sun until then?"
okay. secondary on the canister.
okay. drop her on down. 04 17 37 47 cer really. really. 04 17 37 50 lm2 wait a minute. get the latch out of the way.
"watch it, there's a crater right behind you."
"okay, karl; thank you."
leave the up data link open. we'll call for it when we want you to put it in.
okay. we concur with whatever blocky crater you want to stop at up there.
i'm sure we could drive down; i don't think we could drive back out.
"oh, yes. we're all set to go. _o sweat, it says here in fine print."
okay. go again.
i don't see how they could have.
wristlet covers. don wristlet covers.
yes.
i'll move it around and see if you see it.
another y?
"hey, houston; 16. you can go ahead with mhe cryo tank reconfiguration."
"man, oh man, it's taking a long time thinking this over."
suit circuit r_i'urn valve is coming open. nyuh- nub-huh-nub.
"okay, we're closing it."
"okay, do you want to trim it?"
"it's working, but we got to check it out. it comes up very shortly, i understand. some time today."
"houston, 15. i guess the consensus would say that the - the shock was about one-tenth of the other pyros we've seen up to this point."
"we're on a steep slope. your belt is caught. just a minute. just a minute. okay, hold on there. by golly, joe. this rover is remarkable. i'm telling you, we have climbed a steep hill, and we didn't even really realize it. and, we were going like 10 clicks up this hill, and we're on a slope of - - 05 23 55 03 i/wp-eva it must be at least - -"
"okay, she is locked."
"houston, endeavour."
yes.
"yeah, y'all go get some rest. it'll be a busy day later on."
okay.
"houston, did you copy noun 05, and are you look- (tranq) ing at 93? over."
"yes. come on up here, and i'll get the cores up. --"
at 10-minute intervals? o8 o8 4o o8 cmp huh?
"right on, jim. thank you."
"and the earth is - you should be locked up, i guess. and the earth is boresighted in the boresight machine."
i can't see it out the window. it's going off the back end of it.
"roger, al. and we got a couple of vhfs - we got _ a single vhf window for you if you want to try and get hold of the crew down below. aos is 151:51:25 and 152:0_:15 for los. over."
okay. the lumpy descartes plains. 06 21 39 52 l_-eva - - but not docked. 06 21 39 5_ cc the lumpy descartes plain.
"you got another 15 degrees to go, al."
"here's a new crater right there, charlie."
"it is about, near as i can tell, 150 meters, but the rocks - rocks around it are really something else. that's the problem, the trafficability up to it."
"roger, bob; we're watching."
if there's any way. i don't know how to get it.
"in other w_rds, i've got the 50:18 the second time. then you want the verb 74, enter."
"stand by just a minute, charlie."
okay; can you confirm that that's 100 percent on the lcru blanket rather than 65 percent as per the checklist?
got to get - this out of the way.
"houston, columbia .... (columbia)"
"it is. okay. 04 14 17 49 _4p throttle control, auto; com_4ander. age80 confidential:' day"
"well, that's all right."
okay. stand by.
i like that. you get - -
go ahead.
"now, wait a minute."
okay; let me know when you have an answer.
"yeah, with all the things that are on the front side, i'll have to admit that in many respects -- it 's - it 's more interesting. i'm not sure there's any more to be seen or learned here, but it's - there's enough extra variety that it's easy to - to recognize something that's different. you don't have to look so hard to see what's the same. when i look down a% the - at the individual sections of material, i look at this cayley down here, - oh, what am i looking at - ptolemaeus and alphonsus, the floors that - that cayley fill. it looks just on the detail scale as the stuff on the back side does. and the - the rims around the craters like alphonsus - that material looks just like the stuff on the back side. when you get down to the detail level, it all has the same features. the only thing that i see that's - that's quite a bit different is i don't see any of these rille systems on the back side anywhere."
"okay, jim, we estimate we've got 1 more hour on the primary cartridge, and 6 or 7 hours on the ': :5 ['.,'?; ::'? ;'_ ' secondary."
i understand you're taking it out of zero now.
see that sharp corner? right up at the top there?
got about 50 seconds. 05 06 31 25 dmp-lm thank you.
okay. go. we're looking good so far. ·
"can't tell whether - nice and cohesive, it holds a straight wall very well. it 's very fine powder, just like - graphite. (laughter)"
"oh, you're shining in the sunlight howl boy, is that pretty !"
"trouble is my eyes was tearing so bad i couldn't look out and watch it. dadgu_mit' 07 08 07 45 _ oh, that was a - that was some lift-off. there was a piece of the mesa blanket went out there about 300 meters. ipm glad we put the alsep over where we did. that thing would have - could have wiped it out. and it hit the ground with a big - ton of bricks."
"no, i sure didn't, but i*** won't have any trouble putting this back in place, houston."
very good.
*** plss data looks good down here. · cdr yes. there's the tone. therels a press flag and a vent flag.
you're right over the top of what?
roger. and go wide on the high gain.
"16, houston, we got a ~ an answer to your question about the wrist rings on your suit."
go ahead.
okay.
we'll get the full p30 rate - -
bootprints are by it. that must be it.
"okay, just a second here, we'll get a little more tension. coming over the sill; put a little more tension, please. there you are. okay, coming over the steps now. okay. there are the steps, and i'll take it down slowly."
*** get any of those?
"okay. for descartes, 173:39:18, 44:08, 45:48, i 146:n3a6u,ticanlorthmil1e.. f-i, 173:15:02, 19:52, 21:32, i 22 - that's 22:20 for t3_ and south 10. }7 03 23 28 cc good readback, ken."

"okay, we copy."
... what 3 really is.
",.,,_lz7_r_.two minutes and counting."
...
"because you didn't want them to get moved inadvertently, i guess. it doesn't matter, jim, they can be out or in in terms of powerdown. they just don't count."
"okay, it's a dark inconel cover."
roger.
"okay. 02 04 42 57 _p houston, with the binocs out looking at the earth, we can see florida and the - the real blue water _ound the bahamas. on around the gulf of mexico, looks like you might have some clouds near houston _ld on down in new mexico and the great lakes up in the north, where there's lots of clouds on up north of that."
i think so - i think - -
i'm tangled up in this spaghetti here.
"ron and gene, we saw your master alarm. did you have any - anything on the matrix light up?"
"okay. solar wind collector, do your collection."
"i knew it was. okay. you take this and put this under your seat, if you want, jack. and i'll get the tge. oh, let me put your shovel back on for you. i'll get it."
"11, houston. we were wondering, neil, with your closing comment on the tv, if you were going to turn it off. it indicated that you might be con- sidering turning it back on. we were wondering whether we want to keep the lines up. over."
"yeah, i thought they said that was our closest point of approach, and it sure doesn't look to me like it's gonna be. looks like we passed it back there about 20 minutes ago."
"okay, circuit breakers. mine are all good."
"okay, houston. we put in 2 feet per second aft. and that was done just at local horizontal."
roger .... - -
"dave, which of the upper ones have you touched now, r both of them? 05 20 54 28 cdr-i_ yes, that's the only way we can get to them right now, joe ·"
okay. will do shortly.
"loud and clear, houston. how me?"
yes.
thank you.
"okay, houston. i'm going to open the pressure equy_ization valve going into the turmei. can you keep an eye on =_ cabin pressure?"
i put up snap strap. i don't know what the hell you're supposed to do with these two bags. 03 17 35 10 _ ...
copy that.
"okay, 16 ecs cabin repress, open."
"okay. ""configure dse, high bit rate, command reset"" at 153 even."
nope. any conclusion they come to would be guessing anyhow. i suspect that main b is running a little bit lower than main a and they probably both got pulled down. you didn't happen to notice ...? i'm sure you didn't. i wouldn't have.
roger.
yes ....
"yes, that's all right. i got that picture, anyway. okay. radar test, landing. you ready?"
"john, i'm gonna start a pan. *** little bit more cooling here."
ell right.
you start a clock backwards?
"hello there, aquarius. how do you read me now?"
"okay. you can give me scb-5 then, and -"
"okay. 192:41, john."
"roger. in the table, under item number 8."
"okay, al. and i have a csm consumables update and a number of other things, when you're ready to listen to them '."
we should have mag - -
"odyssey, houston."
"0kay, 239, 169, and 330. that's wrong."
"jack, it's not required to go back and do them again; we watched it on telemetry."
that's what i wanted.
"no. don't worry about it, bob. i was just curious. i - no news is as good as good news."
roger.
"charlie, you got hold of a foot some w_v ... in your gear. 04 21 47 58 lm2-lm okay."
you see that large block on the - -
"hello, houston. how does it look?"
"okay, joe, i want to put you on the tv ... if i can't find the - the old earth here."
cas_er_ go ahead.
we don't have it. huh.
i will.
"well, i feel lots better. like i told you, geno - i think that you were the jinx on gemini 9 for all the delays. over."
is that all?
"roger, joe. we've located the flight plan. go ahead with your updates."
standby. i think so.
i'm unable to determine altitude at al1 looking out the window. i couldn't tell whetler we were down at 60 or up at 170.
roger. copy.
"roger, karl. you - you wanted to add to - to the - trim rules that we already have established for the plane change. that if the residual is a plus v greater than 2/10ths of a foot per second, gy then we roll clockwise 90 degrees and use the minus-z thrusters. otherwise, the same as printed in the flight plan. f- 06 19 25 55 cc that's affirmative, al."
copy that.
okay.
yes.
"roger, karl."
i'll say.
okay.
that rover really ... some of the - you should have seen some of the things that that rover did today. you wouldn't believe it.
and after this - -
"tell you when you get to 2.8, dave - distance - i'll let you know."
i realize there is no
"17, it's your computer. you have a state vector, verb 66, and a target load, and a pipa bias update."
sure thing. can i read back the ... when i read back the ones that said it?
understand.
okay. 0hhh.
okay.
correction - make that for the next orbit. you already have the aos/los for this orbit.
okay.
okay.
"yes, i don't doubt that. okay. what's the next one?"
"houston, america. ?"
"no. go ahead, bob."
"hello, houston. how do you read?"
all right.
"that's right. who needs a pulley? this is easier this way. 04 22 55 h2 cdr wait a minute. go ahead, pull. 1, 2, 3. that a boy."
"i can't read this thing, because it's full of dust, so i've got to get off and dust it."
okay.
"the possibility, ron, was when you were reloading nob_- 79, getting a smaller dead band - iv depends upon where the vehicle was at that time within vhe old dead bands e_ 523 might have suddenly found you outside the dead band and been unhappy."
"okay; we're in lo bit rate. houston, how do you read falcon on low bit rate?"
roger. our data down here we worked on during the back side shows you're in 58.8 by 10.6.
"we could go out to - okay, go ahead, pick a place. i'll get the gnomon. you going to get it? okay."
"- - slipped that ... and i won't have anything to do - - 0b 03 14 15 izmp - - i've already scratched ""cb(16) abort stage - close"" for the previous burn."
what'd you say?
okay. i'm at page 18.
"roger, jack. you might take a look at our dp_ burn card, our checklist card that we have in the lm, and see what changes might have to be put in that checklist."
"charlie, they say they think you've slept 6 hours."
"okay, i pitched down. 07 09 18 52 _p-lm okay. 07 09 18 54 c_ okay, it will be a half degree a second. are you all set?"
better still so we won't freeze up our urine dump.
"okay, casper, you can go ahead and turn the power on."
descent 02 . roger.
"okay, ed. let me see the checklist a minute, please? 05 23 27 28 cml° okay, houston, i have - -"
"(ha, ha) hot on vox. - -"
okay.
yes.
"verify fan, off; pump, off."
"oh, yeah. alpha and beta are two of the prettier sta:?s you can find. even i can recognize those."
"hey, pete?"
that' s affirm.
i can't keep it open because of - of the pressure.
"boy, i can't see my camera setting, it's so full of dust."
"houston, do you copy our residuals?"
what are you doing?
go ahead.
we got ptc orientation in the computer?
"and, aquarius, tests in the simulator just showed that if you want to let the pgns dap hold your attitude for you, it will."
wait a minute. going back to min cooling. what do you need?
do you have - do have any dark - do you have any dark halo craters near sulpieius gallus?
you want to show me it? 03 i1 04 37 cdr yes. my pleasure. look. there it is. look.
i think that's right.
"4.1. cml° well, we'll go on up to about ... well_ there's the total suits."

"listen, if anything happens during this period, the only thing we can say is that we died so that the germs may live, and that ain't no good at all. 09 03 3p 42 cmp (laughter) i don't plan to have that."
"hey, bob, what's my shadow length right now?"
"hey, that's good and loud. okay. alarm is off."

what more can you ask for?
"yes .... got my - man, i tell you, this little navigation map i'ye got on my hand - cuff checklist is - is unquestionably the greatest thing that i've ever - done. i_mp-eva sure hard to tell where north is on it, th°ugh."
"the cmc mode on the optics on zero to resolve - ail that's put to bed. i'm going to start the 509. i'll look at your talkbacks first. oh, now i've got 2, i got 2 of these things that show barber pole. both the mass spec and the gamma ray."
"yes, true."
"i got an awful pretty looking intrepid sitting out the window, here, gang - we'll go get her."
"... up-and-down, hummocky terrain, i think with - oh, i'm sorry."
"well, i didn't look at it from that standpoint when i was going over it before, but - i guess i'll have to take a special look at that to answer your question."

"oh, yes. okay. mag bags all fall out - fell out."
yes. it's on. the only question is whether it's on - completely all the way. i think it _s. **_ know as soon as the cooling comes in.
"right, so we probably ought to h_ad directly fcr flank and on up from there."
okay.

"houston, you got any recommendations there?"
yeah.
"h,,_i"

"okay, houston. i got one more rock here that i was looking at out of the window of the lunar mod- ule. and i got plenty of pictures of it so you -"
"oh, there's a big boulder. we just crossed over a buried rounded boulder. must've been a meter and a half across, with - of course, it's all gray - -"
"okay. we'd like you to have d_knd regs, both of them, go to egress, please."
i'm going to straighten this lec out right now.
sounds good. thank you.
"or better yet, i bet i'd get a better picture, huh?"
we'd like that. thar_ you.
okay.
sounds good.
"son of a bitch. we're sure - shooting the goddamn oxygen, we better watch it."
"okay. i got the same problem on the chuck, houston. i think the - the rock is so tough that the chuck bites into the core stem and just won't release it without that vise."
"man, that thing won't want to go on. that's be- cause it's not in there. put it in right, and it goes on."
"- - ice chunks, possibly. or maybe there's paint coming off of it."
"incidentally, just going over the littrow area again. i described the - what looked some - some, at least, fumarolic vents. they look like small cinder cones to me. and every time i look at them, they - that firms up my impression more and more that they're vol - volcanic cinder cones. also, i noticed one rille, and i'd like to try and get some pictures of it here before we get too far away from littrow on the next - maybe tomorrow. looks very distinctly like the roof, or the - the top of the rille is collapsed in some places, and the rille is exposed in other places."
okay; i guess we expected that.
right.

okay.
"hey, we have a picture, 17. we have a picture."
roger.
"okay, jim. that's a most interesting comment. and as you know, with about l0 minutes to go during the experiment today, we'll ask for you to turn over and be oriented with your face away from - the moon, and we might very well get the same sort of information this time. al, i've got a photo pad for you to copy when you're ready. and then, jim, you can just go ahead and switch to vox mode, if you don't want to push your push to talk while you transmit to us. your choice on that, though."

roger. in work.
"okay, ken. and in connection with that, we want to verify that the pitch is minus 40, yaw is 90 on the high gain."
"roger. copy that, dave. it looked good to us."
"as usual, all you greenies."
map camera is standby.
"... over here, john."
we're back at the minus-z strut now. _** very little force of impact that we actually had.

"pyro arm, safe."

yeah.

"you gonna put that back to auto before we get out, charlie?"
"okay. we've got three obliques. the last one is one i asked for recently. it's just a blow-up of the second one. the first one is one that's got dotted lines on it, indicating horizon view and 50-degree lpd; and all three of those are in the transfer book. over."

43:30.
can't see it.
"i think you can get this one up here, can't you?"

"okay, ken. we got the 93. you are clear - - 04 22 38 ]6 cmp okay, you folks have the angles. 04 22 38 ]7 cc - - to torque."
"oh, he did a great job. okay, we're back into a thicker part of the ray, tony. the regolith is here covered with cobbles about 40 to 50 percent. you're gonna have to bear way left, john. okay, now, if we hold that range, like the - the tack in - look at that piece of glass we just roiled over. this'll be great - 015, we've got to go."
and you might check your zpn settings when you - your sensors - when you get a chance on the back side here. they're still not giving much good data.
yes.
i'll tell you what it came off....
"13, houston. inco suggests you try average if you're in peak to see if that gives us a better picture."
"okay. seems like kind of a quick change for some- thing like ice, doesn't it?"
"okay. stand by, and i'll see if we want to re- charge it or something. we'll check on what they want to do. can you give us a rough idea of what sort of angle it was tilted at and in which direction?"
"and, 17, we're ready for a grav measurement."
"123:06, okay."
"yep, sure do."
"yes, i guess you could. hight."
"okay, houston. i didn't copy the name of the star, but how about castor or pollux or betelgeuse or somebody like that?"
"all right, reject."
"we're gonna have to hook that back up, because we're going to do a checkout again tomorrow and hook it into here."
not changing.
yes; that's affirm- the presleep checklist.
keep a little momentum going here.
"right. oh 14 48 13 cdr iiouston, aquarius. 04 ih 48 16 cc go ahoad."
"yeah, we're - the only way we'll keep from screwing up is to follow the checklist. which comes after - comes after the tunnel. wait a minute. after what? no, sir. i got a coarse align that comes 40 min- utes after probe and drogue. if i get out of sync, i'm going to make you run the ... well, you're way ahead of your time line, and i'm just barely hanging on."
*** problem?
okay. going tv r_mote now.
"we'll play games with the extension handle, but that's all right."
"ll, houston. on our real-tlme telemetry we saw 95 to 97 10si on chamber pressure. we'll - we will look at the recordings down here, thought, and get back with you again. over."
roger. stand by.
"boy, hank. that comm is just terrible."
roger. the g&c is - just said that's a nominal.
"yes, i think they forgot that."
"okay, we've got you, stu. go ahead and turn it aj_ound; we'll photograph you."
"understand, joe. you want 02 heater in tank 3, auto, and the other two, off."
what happened to your translation control power?
"i'm going to take a quick look back. i think this is poppy, and i can give you a real better idea where we are."
9 to 3?
"okay, i've got the tone."
"... looking at a minute. hey, jim. at pitchover, do you want me to go aft omni or stay forward?"

that's verified.
but there's - -
is your#** tight enough? checklist on ti_t enou_?
no water.
i've already cleaned it once today.
yes; it is.

"and, syst_ 13shutoff valve, closed and barber pole?"
"15, houston through carnarvon. over."
roll over and let me take another look again.
"go ahead, houston; 15. l0 ob 26 l0 cc after some discussion down here, we'd like to disable your jets a2, alfa 2 and bravo l, mainly because the mapping camera's still out and our concern is that the plume will be deflected down into the sim bay and possibly damage some of our electrical wiring or some of the - the n2 plumbing, which may give us other problems."
"okay, you got these? okay, just hit ..."
- - ...
retro says that 4 degrees essential angle equals 94k. you guys are out at about 125k right now.
"okay. couple minutes to los, jim. everything is looking real good. your a0s time at carnarvon will be 52:36, and we don't have too much of a handle on why the inboard cut off early except that it apparently was an engine problem and not a switch-select function. but we are certain that you'll be able to make tli based on what we are looking at now."
okay. lima is 104:42:16.64. over.
"jim, we - you were able to get those voltage - bat a voltage and current readings?"
"your choice on that, cdr. you're ahead of the time line right now."
yes.
okay. (columbia)
okay. go ahead.
circuit breakers in.
yes. we've got to do a mraeuver to the s-ivb. 00 0_ 20 09 cdr let's get through this thing.

that's affirmative - prelaunch.
"thank you, jack. we _copy that."
"yeah, more or less."
"okay. we've got about three items. first one is, all of your p23 batch - two marks have been evaluated and - hey, congratulations. looks real good; they're very happy with it. you're down to 4 arc-minutes on the substellar-point aspect of it, and that's the first thing to mention. the second is, unless you see a need, i don't see any need for you to read back the information we gave you on the solo book and so forth. do you concur?"
maybe we've been desensitized to them. ll o0 46 06 cml° (laughter)
okay. did you mean to leave the computer with verb 21 noun 01 up?
"that's right. i see those, too."
"ron, at your convenience, we would like h tanks l, 2 ._- 2, and 3 fans, off. h2 tankb l, 2, and 3 fans to off."
i think it would be best if you left it alone.
"ob, i did from there, hut i didn't see that - i eculdn't tell whether - you can't see this west side - east side of it to see whether the thing is really filled in from a flow or not or whether it's just subsident. that's what i really wanted to find out. tape 'fi/6"

"bob, you got the high gain?"
"yeah, this - yeah, this is - 180 parking, i guess. yeah. let's don't get too close - we've got to sneak up on it. john, i can't get out."
"hello, apollo 11. houston. we recommend you accept the noun 49 display on the dsky now. over."
"okay, houston. they started at minus 100 on the null bias check; 30 seconds at 118.8."
"briefly, to control pitch and roll, use the ttca, as we've practiced; for yaw you can use the aca. over."
"roger, ron. we're ready for the high gain. if somebody carlbring it up_ we can read you better."
"want me to come down, dave?"
okay. did you want me to continue checking? i figured after i - stand by.

roger.
whew. whew. well.
"and, l?, just for your information, we've searched all the data we can, and we cannot find anything wrong with the spacecraft or the booster at all. everything is looking real fine, and the only prob- lem in the air is that - those master alarms that you have reported - we're not able to tie in any- thing common yet to any of those things either."
"thank you, sir."
"okay. i'm reading you better, jim. say again, please."
"hey, challenger; this is america. i heard you all the way down. that's great. beautiful."
"houston, 15 .... initial rates ..."
"and 8 amperes before pressing the switch. 04 20 16 44 cml° well, great. looks like we made it."
"okay .... do i want to jump to f/ll going across those highlands, huh? at - on the western edge of crisium?"
"let me get those caps, jack. what's - that's what's holding it. holding it from coming out."
"0kay, looks ggod up here. it sounds like the wind whistling, doesn't it?"
"i think it's almost as easy to ... it was designed ... yes, sir. i'm gonna count them ... at least a dozen ... yeah. i'll stow them."
roger. go for pdi. oh 08 26 36 l_ ***
"right now, i'm sort of warm."
"and, jim, you'll get a - a feedwater tone in about a minute. just wanted to warn you, and we're coming up on 20 minutes remaining, 20. 06 04 56 32 irp-eva okay. oh, that is a good picture."
"roger. waste water at - and we got the time on that, and it will be down to 25 percent."
"okay, sir. give my hand a rest."
"well, you've got a permanent invite, any time you like."
okay. i take it we're gonna hold off on this ptc for a while until you've had enough time in this attitude?
"houston, c°lumbia is _nable to read eagle on (colb/_bia) either antenna or on vhf duplex bravo. you got any suggestions?"
okay. 06 21 48 59 iavyp-eva i gave it to them.
..... found the crater.
one minute master arm on and i'll set my watch.
okay. you got omni bravo and we'd like to have you verify that the tape recorder is off please.
"ron, i need your - your noun 20 numbers."
"0kinawa, this is swim 1. i have recovery beacon, ll5 degrees magnetic, at 270, 12 miles, at time 47. over. 12 07 09 ll oki okinawa, roger. out."
"okay. well, now, that's apparently the rim of cone over there. and we're about - almost 2 hours now. is that right, fred?"
"there, i'll stand - i can hand it to you."
"oood range out of that baby. oh 20 25 07 cc al, this is houston. could you tell us where you are in the side or pse sequence?"
"roger. _d now i have the no pdi plus 12. orion, we've turned the biomed off. 04 06 09 46 lmp-_ okay, go ahead. okay, you got the old biomed off."
"okay, charlie. it's - it's no good then."
"stand by. we're talking about that now. you've got - stand by. you've got 25 minutes at this station, guys. we've given you somewhat of an extension here. you're using up some of it hack at the lm, but we've given you - i've given you somewhat of an extension. you've got 25 minutes at this station. the primary priority will be subfloor documented samples, and then subfloor rake soil. as you can imagine."

roger. we know exactly which one you're talking about.
"roger, houston. falcon had a good tpi; it burned a small midcourse l, and a small midcourse 2. presently, we have a visual on the command module and all the solutions have been agreeing very well."
... on.
"roger. say, we've investigated a little more on that possible spike that was alleged by jack - thought he might have seen. and we mentioned, i think, in response to that, about a i or 2 amp jump. well, looking further, we see those all along; and we think they're probably due to minimum-impulse jet firings. we're trying to correlate that data. but the conclusion, right now, is that we really don't see anything on the data to support what jack might have seen. c_ okay, mighty fine. we - just wanted to - you know, in case there was something there - wanted to make sure you all took a look at it."

"i'll work on that, ken. and did you take any earthshine photos?"
"yes, i do. actually we - pete's pads went in a little bit further than did neil's; i'd say most of the pads are in about an inch and a half to two, and it sort of looked like we were moving slightly forward, and that pretty well killed off our left-right velocity when we touched down. the right-hand footpad seems to have bounced; that'd be the plus y, the right-hand-side one; the others don't seem to have. so it must have - maybe hit there first, and rocked back and forth or something."

"okay, fine. we're just a little ginchy down here based on previous experience with the leak. f 05 09 01 32 cdr-i24 well, we - we looked back - just looked back in the back-on - to try to find a lost item, and we looked all through the back end. and there's - there's some condensation on the ecs side, but there's no leaks back there."
okay.
i'm sorry. i didn't even know - i didn't even know it.

you might put one scb on that etb so that'll /lie- it's real light.
what?
"okay, houston. you read me okay on the cdr's loop?"
"oh, by the way, why don't you put this mag on here; 16, we forgot to do that."
roger.
"and *** okay; we've had a change of heart here again, as usual. and we're going to drop station l0 now that we've heard you so much, and we're going to get a double core here. *** to get the - some football-size rocks while you're doing that. but double core here, and then we're going to leave here and go back to the lm. lmp-e_ja you don't want a - you don't want a - you don't want a double core here. i don't think we can do it, bob. it's too rocky."

okay; go ahead.
"well, there's a crater over there. it's true, yes."
"no, i don't think there are essentially a_y no_es required. i'll make a few real-time callups to you; but_ i don't think there's anything you really have to write down. lm_-lm okay, bob_ i didn't realize that things were getting a little hectic yesterday. but, if we end up making any changes where i don't need to get a charge in my hands - that's an awfully good thing to call, because not only does it tire your heart - your hands out holding it, but it me_ls you don't get as many pictures or rover sam_les or anything else."

that's affirmative.

"yeah, yeah. well, that part of it is."
"i'll tell you what, why don't you mosey down there and start taking some photographs?"
"okay, jack. we'd like to have you stay in just a minute or so longer. we're trying to keep track here of the suit circuit pressure and see if it stabilizes or starts to drop. the one reg which has been intermittently leaking - we still haven't isolated it. and we think we've got it shut off, but we're still watching it. so bear with us just a minute or so."
"houston, this is hadley. we're ready to copy."
okay; why don't you go ahead with the flight plan update first.
you go to b or just use a?

"okay. everything is in order up to this point as far as the checkout goes, with the exception of the - lgc. when we pushed in the lgc circuit breaker, we got a program light - with a 400 and r-1. a verb 5 noun 9 gave us - gave us an ll05, which seems to be of little consequence; just thought you might llke to know."

okay.
and check your logic power.
"come on, baby,"
"okay, check all that -"
"what you need, ken?"
"roger, dave. we're looking toward the cabin de- press at about 8:00 o'clock houston time."
"propellant quantity monitor, off. you did that?"
"yeah. in the sunlight, houston, this white rock has sort of a greenish hue to it, this white rock breccia. which is what all this is we're walking on right now is this white rock breccia that charlie chipped out of - charlie chipped out of - and i guess this is probably the second layer up. i would reckon that this - if - if we could see to the bottom, we could say for sure if this big black rock is right out of the bottom. but my guess from the old photograph, is probably is."
"roger. copy. also, did you notice - was there any indication of any dust cloud as you lifted off? over. (goss net 1) tape 88/5 05 17 18 02 cdh not very much. there was quite a bit of _(apton and parts of the lm that went out in all direc- tions, usually for great distances, as far as i can tell. but i don't remember seeing anything of a dust cloud to speak of."
"stand by about another ... 04 02 5! 13 lmp houston, eagle. 2 think i've got you on the high-gain antenna now. ags are go. / 51 36 cc columbia, houston. if you go to reacq on the high gain, we can acquire you now. over.

"that's correct, bob. the bistatie vhf radar test."
roger.
put this over on a1 bean's side; he's got all the freaking pills out of the csm medical kit.
"it's at 2000 feet, but it's hardly closing at all."
"okay, jack. and it looked good."
"that's going in bag - - {]512 43 17 cc well, the board, i think, is - - 05 12 43 1p cdr say, that's good. and - -"
"okay; here we are, 1.5 and 185."
"that's right. i agree with you. hank, we'd like to - i'd like to run a p52 here and see - see what kind of torquing angles we get. that will tell us whether or not we really been having any kind of a - of a hangup in the a-to-d section. as short as it was, we couldn't have gotten very far off in attitude."
make sure that's all of it.
"oh' here, dave."
we'll have to pull that one out. *** (tranq)
- ...
"whose helmet's this, dick's?"
you're looking at delta-h.
roger. thank you.
"oh, yes. bob s i dug a trench in the side of this crater. i've got down-sun pictures of it. there is quite a marbling of light and dark soil or fine grain material. it looks as if there's a uniform, about 3-centimeter layer of light material over that marbled light and dark. on the very top surface, there's a half centimeter of light gray, and when i say dark, i mean a medium gray."
roger. did you copy? no circ.
"okay. t-horizon, 93:48:04; tca minus 20 is 50:44."
okay. yes. ob 08 36 06 lmp yes. it looks like a snow-covered prairie. and doesn!t that look like a brown to you?

"oh, well, we've got to have something to ... besides, we can get rid of the i_4 ... decide then what they'll do."
"no, it's correct according to the - -"
"no, i want your camera."
"okay, jimmy. real fine."

"call - call me the things, charlie."
(singing)
"did you? and then it - when we pitched over, i could see the descent stage like you said."
looks like it's a little bit easier than doing that in the chamber.
"endeavour, go ahead."
"ron, while you're doing your maneuvering, no need to answer, but just a reminder. due to the - stop- ping your roll angle differently, you're under the ei refsmmat attitude, your roll will be about 046, and you'll see a max yaw of about 64 degrees during this gyro torquing."
"13, houston."

i think mag qq is all gone. shall i use the rr?
"do you want me to slide around on this side and help? 05 06 56 31 cdr-ia{ i need that flashlight again, charlie. what did you do with it? put it hack in here? page88o 05 06 56 hh cdr-lm okay."

that sounds like a good plan.
"yes, you're hitting on the - shelf."
"okay, we're back into a - we're back into about a 5-percent rock cover as we cross the edge of the sherlock block field."
"just a second. age ,-106 onfidentt ii 6"
i'm at the dump valve.
"okay. left-hand row, top switch, off."
"and the high gain antenna angles; change them from a ""-40 and 90"" to ""20 and 180."""
okay. do you hear me okay?
"okay. why don't you set it on the seat, huh? 07 02 37 ]3 lmp-eva okay."
okay. got it?
okay.
"roger. your lm gyro torque angles: x, minus 0004.5; y, minus 0003.5; z is minus 0009.2. over."

"apollo 16, houston."
(laughter) and - any bubbles on the inside of the tires? (laughter)
"roger, jim. we will."
okay.
okay. stand by a minute. let me move back.
"how's our time, bob?"

roger.
"go ahead, houston."
"(laughter) well, you got to - you got to be fas% on your feet. and we're 168 above the rescue redline."
okay.
"and, charlie, i interruoted. what - what were you saying?"
think that ought to work?
"boy, that's heavy."
...
"okay, jack. switch now on ascent number 2 02 tank, descent 02 is closed."
"okay; copy that, geno."
"go ahead, 17."
"i'm sorry. i led myself astray. yes, overlap it, because it won't stick to that thing very good. no, it just won't stick ... we'll just take tape and wrap all the way around the thing. otherwise, it's not going to stick, period. yes. it's up? that's right. (chuckle)"
"jack, have you got the top of the bag closed?"
let's see. the 02 flow is high.
"okay, copy that. he's picking up ..."
"look, i'll tell you what. let's leave the whole - tell you what, let's take the tool carrier with us -- --"
okay. c - dispi_y/engine override logic is closed.

"hey, that's good cooling."
"oh, okay."
"apollo 11, this is houston. over."

okay. panels 1] and 16 cbs ascent eca to closed.
"i am not kidding. and it's got lath crystals in it and a black matrix, but it is not - it is not basaitic."
"oh, okay."
"okay. thenk you, karl. that's good news."
"joe, looks like, - h-m-m - we may have a problem. let's see. can always pull those out and put four more in."
as if you're hanging up in something. watch your hand controller.
"yes, that's right. i'm just going over archimedes now."
yeah. now let's take the - put them on bus c.
"yes, i was going to remark about that on the - the downslope side."
"roger, 15. we see you maneuvering to ptc, and we're requesting that you not maneuver to ptc until the sim bay covers are closed. i don't know whether they're closed at the moment or not."
roger.
"apollo 15, houston. stand by to retract the mapping camera."
"- - we'd like to sample - okay. go ahead, john."
"okay, i copied the angles for you if you need _hem."
"okay, we'll stand by."
aren't you going to ...?
negative. 15. 1 5.

okay. (eagle )
okay. give me another call on start.

"roger, dave. read you loud and clear on that, and that really brings us to our last question. we're in the process of starting to plan your traverse tomorrow. it's going to be a good one. we have no equipment problems that we're looking at right now and we'd like to ask you if there're any particular inputs you would like to make into the planning team regarding tomorrow's traverse. over."
"hey, why don't you turn around, jim?"
"roger. copy. parting planes, thank you."
"casper, houston. go ahead."
"go ahead, 17."
okay. cml° okay.
thank you.
"yes, let me have that ... 05 22 47 21 im? okay."
fine.
right there?
"well, i - i think that's gonna be the name of the game until we get a -"
"yes, that's good. okay; i think i got the - the major portion of it, jim."
"well, the schedule numbers all went out the window. 2.6 5"
okay.
where did that one go?
"no, i don't think they're supposed to·"
"okay, that's in work, joe."
"yes, i'm just trying to get them all sorted out."
i don't know what it is; i don't have any idea.
"go ahead, al. we're listening."
"ok_t; copy. okay, and then at the bottom of that page, after the p52, put in - i'm sorry - let's do it before the p52. add ""start emp 509."" and this is just an arbitrary point that we've - that we've picked, ken. we're getting close enough now that we think we ought to have 509 running. we would prefer you to go ahead and do the p52 in scs, as you have been doing. but let's just have 509 running before you go into that p52."
*** like you're on a downslope over there?
wait a minute. let's get you off - -
... check it ....
okay. 07 00 17 lb cdr-iam you - your flow ought to cool you there; it's cooling me pretty good.
"17, houston. we gather you're ready for sleepy almost. one thing we'd like to check at the end here is your 02 heater configuration. over."
how's that? 05 05 49 19 i_ip-lm ... say great! got them. filthy. here you go. gimme - no.
"roger. and, at 247 plus 32, we'd like to have ""mass spec multiplier, high; discriminator, high."""
"p, as in papa; 17 delta, d as in delta. 17 delta."
"well, i guess ..."
- - i was kind of wishing it would get a little thicker up there one of these days.
"okay, with the new uv settings - wait a minute."
"no ullage, no-go for pdi."
"so, now we have a three-stem section and three one- stem sections."
"bob, the sceptre's in hand."
"there's a nice deep one there that's smooth and rounded, about 30 meters across."

"okay, do i have core tubes on me now? i mean caps?"
z guess that's verified.
"yeah, it is a big piece of glass."
"]6, did you copy on the alpha particle/x-ray cover?"
ullage -
okay. thank you.
how about any of that?
"no, that's the pile, right there. see where my - see where i turned over the two rocks alongside the great big rock, where my foot tracks are? 05 12 15 56 l_ on yes, way down there at the end."
we're enjoying it.
mark.
okay. i've got my water warning. (tr_/iq)
no. the other one is still on and it still holds in the back part of the sep where the dsea is in the shade.
"houston, apollo 16. good morning."
"well, i'm just real sorry about that delay this afternoon. i wish i had known more about it. i'd already decided that if it was - if it was just oscillatory and stable, i was going to take it."
"okay. 05 23 12 12 imp-eva okay. hm. happy birthday, it says. *** edc, left seat; pan quad iii. well, guess what? i'm on the wrong - wrong side .... works better for me, tony, if i skip out here rather than - if you want some of this blackish rock, john, a small one that's - that's bagable, _-_ there's a bunch right out here that look just like what i call that basalt. in fact, there's hundreds of them."
*** let's get the oxygen on.
that's affirmative. okay; and we've got your biomed coming through.
"i tell b_ou, this weightlessness is really great, isn't it? 00 02 14 l1 12{° yes, i'll enjoy it."
"apollo 15, houston. over."
"dave, that's my understanding, too. i think - the main reason - for wanting to do this if time is available and it's o - and it's only - would be a nicety - would be it - gives us a warm feeling regarding the film."
- - i got to go back for a second ride just to see oops again (laughter).
"okay. i'll press on then. (_;o:',n_e:t £) tape 18/9"
"hey, falcon; endeavour. how do you read?"
"okay, joe; i'll start doing the p52."
...
"not really. i feel a little bit - ..., you know?"
"okay. okay, tony, i got a footprint in, but i'll put the - the spade - the shovel - the scoop, rather, will be right - right west of where the fillet was taken."
...
"this is the most frustrating job. you'd never make a living as a carpenter wearing a pressure suit, i'll tell you. okay. john, how about spin- ning and taking one more picture of that in the ground. could you?"
i'm checking it off here. right now i'm at 108:10. i'm - haven't - changed the canister yet. let me check and see if i can have time to do that or not.
sample bag number 7 is in a-9.
"roger; i understand that. the ""lmp"" was just a cue that you're the only one on the comm at the time, so you'll be the one to - to have to listen and get it down."
okay.
"and on that west rim, we've got about l0 or - l0 percent boulder cover."
sure can.
"roger. we concur. the prog for 12:00 - let's see, that's about 6 hours from now - shows it to be right over the vietnam area, the viet - vietnam peninsula there. so it looks like it's moving the way they're progging it, huh?"
roger.
i 'm sorry. i misunderstood you.
"okay. now, here's the other thing here, that safety line. confidenti"
okay.
"hold - hold the geology; let's get the rover squared away first. okay; 8 kilometers up a little rise. okay, turning back."
"yes, sir, ..."
"tell them we got to do that. that's right .... salvage the son of a bitch. otherwise, we could ..."
"when do i go to the - oh, you go to sep. that's right."
"oh, isn't that pretty! okay, oop - too much, huh? let me go around. there, how's that?"
oh_ that's a big crater. we got to get around here.
"america, houston. your cabin pressure's up to 5.5, 5.5."
...
open.
"right. okay, i got the lcru battery covers dusted off, and the console on the lrv isn't too bad, i dusted that off. it wasn't too bad anyway."
okay.
"okay, fred-o. reading you 5-by. the procedure i'm going to read up to you is a sun check for the - to see if we're going to need an alinement or not. if you'll get out your g&n dictionary and open it to p52, page 34, we'll start at the bottom. over."
"minus 5, minus -"
okay.
that's affirmative. over.
"okay, there's the comm coming up."

"mobility is - very great under this crushing one-sixth-g load, houston."
"okay, jim. thank you. sounds good."
"okay, i just went by spacecraft terminator."
"you don't want to call them flow fronts, and yet there is definitely a margin. there are two different - distinctly different units, but whether they're just - part of it's consolidated and part of it's talus, it's very hard to discern. the central peaks and all these things - everything back here's been mantled, it looks like. even the things that are relatively sharp. there are sharp features back here. 05 07 28 b8 cmp quite a few very sharp things, as sharp as things in the front. everything in here has just been mantled. 05 07 29 b9 _ i'd say that there's nowhere near the number of craters out here that there is on the front side on the - there are nowhere near as many sharp ones. there's an awful lot of - constructional things and there's some tremendous blocks up ar - around this one back here. just blocks all over the place, around and on the outside, and then this big mud pie that just oozes up inside. it looks like it might even carry through on the flanks. 05 07 30 b5 cmp must be coming up on king. sure enough. 05 07 b0 45 cmp gonna be hard pressed to see very much of kapteyn on this pass. no, we weren't talking about abul wgfa either. it's north of abul w_fa. it's more like in the area - i got to get me a new set of coordinates. and there's - that ought to be chaplygin. no, what's the name of that thing? lohse [?]. how about that."

"okay; i'm going to cut down to the south here, jim."
(laughter)
i'll get it. cp-1 is 164:52. got - 27 minutes according to our lower equipment bay clock.
"okay, houston. you don't - y'all have telemetry now?"
"america, houston. you can go ahead and start the verb 49 maneuver. have a change in the high gain angles, though, as printed there. make it a plus 30 and 190, instead of minus 40 and 90. that's a plus bo and 190 on the high gain."
okay.

"well, i don't think you need the exercise; you may as well extract it now. 05 14 31 44 lmi° i agree. i'll take a picture of it, a final pic- ture of it, to show you how far we got with it."

do you think you'll be gsle to recognize the edge of tke continuous ejecta blanket?
okay. now you can give me your tephem.

okay; we'll see if we can locate it.
"okay, henry. how about if we stop ptc right here at this 144-degree pass?"
"circuit breaker first. cabin repress, open."

"i've been talking to don beaty and dick kruse and looking over a transcript of - of a science press conference we edited up. it was kind of ragged but possibly interesting summary of the science as it stands now. in response to your question of - of items that might help you prepare for tomorrow's press conference, i can come with you with those words any time you wish."
"okay. very good, ken."
"okay, houston. he's not hooked up yet but will be shortly. and, we'll verify the gamma ray, out and on, and the x-ray, on."
yes. 06 22 20 26 ia{p-eva *** 53 yankee.

okay. i'll be ready to do it whenever you -
"- - our camera keeps hanging up in that - on that cable, and we'd like for you perhaps, if you think it's feasible, to tape a part of the cable below the fastening device on the staff of the high gain antenna. if you think a piece of tape right there might help, we suggest you go ahead and do that now."
okay.
"oh, look at that - wait until you get over and look at that south massif. is that -"
"that ... rock may have been too much. take that rock out, and - -"
"well, either way i think is fine, gene. but i would suggest behind the rock."
yes.
three minutes? you want to put 3 minutes - i'll put 2-1/2 on there.
"emergency 02 valve, closed."
i guess - -
fine.
"okay, vance. while we're waiting, do you have there also what i can expect ground to uplink me ?"

i did.

"right on that. joe, you realize that when i went up to the sm sep attitude, i had to use ttca to do it. 05 ]8 06 25 cc that's affirm. we know that. that's okay."
...
"available, yes."
"the backg,'ound tone at _he - t:ie background noise that the system is _k_ng righz now is a little different than it was making before, if that would help you figure out what the problem was. it's almost like it wasn't up-!i.mking, maybe."
okay.
"43, 4-3."
"and, houston, we're all on. you can go with your comments."
we're about on a horizontal in front of him.

"houston, 15."
"all right, that's what i want. here you go."
"just for some information for ron, in particular. we've evaluated the data from the mapping camera and the pan camera cycling there and it looks real good. everything looks right normal."
"just now looking at the altai scarp and, boy, it's well named in this lighting."
roger.
"you got the line-of-sight rates nulled now, ken."
"dave, we've got another shallow depression here up ahead. and i - i don't know whether - i'd say, we'd be better off staying to the north, wouldn't you?"
"that's correct. and, of course, when we turn, they dig in, and it makes the rear end break out. but it's okay; we can handle it. _"
"and just prior to getting into the rest - sleep, we can take battery b off the charge; terminate the charge."
i can't believe this - this dirt.

got it.
okay.

"okay, jack. that correlates with what we've seen here in the way of signal strengths dropping in and out. stand by, and i'll see where we want to go from here."
okay. copy that.

okay; do you want to vent it now? it's at 2.

"go ahead, joe."
okay. just don't worry about it then. just press on with your radials.
"that ain't no problem, but ... those dingalings."

"okay, ron."
"okay. let's get your plss off and then i'll stow. let me - let me stow this stuff, okay?"
"okay, going to integrity check."
"okay, america. we're about 3 minutes from los. all systems look good. and g&c has noticed that you've got the optics not in zero, and next time you're down that way, it would make everybody feel better if you'd put it there. it's not - not some- thing that you have to do right away."
"challenger, houston, over."
looks like someone walked across it.
"it looked it to me, but it's not now."
your back is clean.
"okay, orion. we have the up-links in, and i'm ready to give you the ags abort constants. 02 06 24 17 lmp-lh okay, stand by. go ahead."

"okay. we'll leave it closed now, and during cabin depress, we'll probably open it then."
"okay. and, as i said, let's don't make any changes to the checklist. let's massage this overnight. but, basically, what you're going to do is continue to use scs control for your p52s, and then we'll - as we start into our entry program, we'll make one entry as we go into p61, and then 509 protection will be in once average g and p61 comes back up. and then, as you activate the entry dap, this is going to kill 509, because it - it resets the dap registers. so after you enter the entry dap, you're going to have to do your verb 21 noun 46 and put - put your three back in r-1 of noun 46. the procedures look pretty straightforward, ken. there's - like i say, these two spots where you need to make these entries, they look real straightforward, and it's the same numbers that - that you've been using. and once you have put 509 back in after activation of entry dap, then it will be in throughout the rest of the entry."
"okay, and let us know when you start."
let's go around the rim. _- 06 01 40 23 lmp-eva okay.
"good morning, yankee clipper; this is houston."
"did you have a table there of the various gravity readings, and if so, what did we get at van serg? in your - relative to - to the landing site - landing point?"
"yes, you'd better - if you can. boy, you're really jammed in there, jim."
"okay, jim. sounds good. should be in attitude in just a minute. and your angles 205 and 70, as in the flight plan, should be good, and we're about 13 minutes from los."
and they are coming down.
okay.
"okay, 35 minutes, the ascent bats are coming on. they're on - at 103:42."
"hello, hadley base. this is houston. no need to acknowledge. i have a report from the back room for you. the alsep has been turned on. we're getting a very high signal strength from the central station, and every experiment seems to be working normally. it's an outstandir_ job. i thought you'd be interested in the fruits of your labors there. over."
you were just checking up on us.
no. go ahead; try it.
okay. (laughter) thank you.

"yeah, well, i don't know."

yes. not much.

go ahead.
"okay, houston. we're getting ready to do the light-flash experiment, and we'd like to run the tape recorder so we can get the voice marks on it, if that won't interfere with any of your ..."
"we copy that, geno. and we copy the forward hatch unlocked, right?"
okay.
no.
"okay, we're heading 140; we're out to 1.0."
"and, houston, in our present attitude, a yaw cdu change would be converted to a pitch rate, so that sort of all adds up."
careful.
i don't understand that.
okay. scs.
"houston, out my window is fine now. we got petavius with it's central dome of - a whitish cap - dome, and it's a fairly subdued crater, and the lineations running into it - the rilles or whatever they are - are just like it's drawn on the map here. 03 03 13 _ cdr some of those central domes are exceptionally dark, and they have exceptionally dark material running down a white surface. you can see that."

okay.

what are you going to do - clean me off? or clean off the old camera?
mark it. barber pole.
that's probably the one you came upon.
"and ll, houston. one final thing. we'd like you to select your omni to omni, omni a to bravo, high-gain track to manual, and beam wide. your angles are 270 in yaw, pitch minus 50. over."

"don, one of the things that i just noticed in passing alphonsus is the dark halo craters. and each of those has a little amount of light material inside of the crater itself, just like all the rest of these craters around here. so maybe a dark halo is really an early stage in development."
okay; you want the receiver on ***
"what happened? 05 00 22 23 ia_p-eva tony, i'm going out for the olympics. i just slung that little - that little - carry bar on the alsep package, the crooked one, about 200 meters, it looked like. there goes the other one. *** a real winner on the hammer throw. look at that beauty go! just created my own secondary. how are you doing with the flag, john?"
...
the oxidizer could drop to 177.
"houston, apollo 11. as a matter of curiosity, our 02 flow meter is pegged full-scale high."
pardon?
"yes, the gulf looks like it's pretty well filled with clouds. looks pretty thick from here."
"yes, i got it. i'm just - - and, i'm trying to keep coremwith them as i'm turning here. l_°-eva yes."
"you know, less pulsing. but don't - don't let that scare you (laughter)."
"okay; copy that, gene."
"roger. minus 0 - okay, wait a minute. okay, it's plus 060. excuse me."
okay.
well.
"okay. eecoms happy about that now, finally. and, gene - the cd - your data looks good."
okay. now try it.
"okay, bob, we're looking right up the dome of the s-ivb."
roger.
there it is.
"for ti-is s_nount of time_ we can really only get the - the ones that are essentially there. 04 21 ih 05 ia{p yes, let me grab sunother weigh bag, because you're too far away for me to - - 0h 21 _4 08 cdr a_ninch in diameter. oh 21 4_ 15 ilvfp - -.can't help you veo' well this way. put some- thing together in a minute. 0i 21 h_ 45 cdr i think i've got them, ed. dh 21 44 47 i_p okay. i'll get one for the fines. age> _04 onfide 5 04 21 44 49 cdp get one for the fines and we'll start - i'd just say, just grab an undisturbed site out of each quadrant, we didn't hit with our feet. cut it down to about a centimeter level - and fill 5he bag that way. ok 21 45 13 l},_: okay. you want the medium-size scoop cr the big scoop roi' this?"
"yes. in fact, i'm pretty sure it's index. it's got the nice side crater in the north - 06 02 58 19 _p-eva yes, i thought index had a larger crater though on the north side."
whoever figured those hydrogens and oxygens out (columbia) a couple of days ago must have known what he was doing.
okay.
we got them.
"say, bob, i'm moving down-sun."
"see, you can't do it that way, al. take it easy. let's do that slow. that a boy. that a boy. now, now, you can let go of it."
"okay, houston, you copying the 93_"
oka]_; let's press on.
roger. understand.
it - it looks to me like it's a - a - a shocked rock with a lot of - and this is a guess - a lo_ of black glass in the fracture patterns.
"okay. go ahead, vance."
"let's see, does that line up with these little marks on there?"
i know it. it came all off the floor; that's the vetero down.
okay.
"you'll have a nominal closeout, guys, as soon as you get back. we're right about on the time that we've been figuring on for you guys to get back there on. right now, you are 6 hours and ll minutes into the eva."
this is the wildest ride i was ever on.
we're in - do you want us to go to accept now?
"after you fly with navy pilots for 3 years, you know - you know what the feeling is."
"okay, do you have any feeling - do you have that hard layer underneath there like you did yester- day, when you raked at station 1, jack?"
"hey, okay. good."
"okay. there's a - an enter. there's a pro, 54."
"yes. okay. connect the 0ps 02 hose to pga, blue to blue. 04 23 15 52 inlo okay. let me find that. i might have to turn around and let you do that."
... $
"oh. i didn't see the switch. 03 15 47 15 imp okay, keep an eye on me, bab_; you never know."
we did that.
"mark. barber pole, off. okay. they're both in the retract position, and everything looks normal. the x-ray is coming on. 03 08 oh 00 cmp mapd<. i've completed the gamma ray and mass spec boom deployment and retraction, and i'm ready to go ahead with the mass spec, deploy, if that's okay with you."
a-b?
"it is a pain. o0 04 o1 54 cml° okay; we have rolled right 20 degrees. o0 04 02 o1 imp man, we fired some jets, i'll tell you."
yeah. we can put it on ...
"okay, thank you."
"okay, houston. how does everything look to you down there?"
three and a half. 12 07 00 03 cml° 4.
stand by.
"houston, can you tell challenger what's wrong with our high gain?"
okay. we are 57 minutes now and we're 20.5.
roger. okay. one more geology question here. was there any difference between the rocks in the bottom of buster and those on the rim of buster?
that'd be just fine. 08 23 19 o0 i34p okay.
no. that's all right.
"it's not a very long procedure, fred. we figure we've got about 15 minutes' worth of power left in the command module, so we want you to start getting over in the lm and getting some power on that. and, you ready to copy your procedure?"
- - ei minus 1 hour 30.
looks like we're really crowding the length of time it's going to take to dump the water - up against the burn time.
why don't you just give me the numbers now?
yeah. how much did you put in?
"right. we concur. we - we don't think you're gonna have to touch it until you go to the dark side. okay, and on the sps - normally during sps cooldown during translunar coast, the helium in the sps oxidizer tanks is absorbed by the oxidizer, causing a decrease in oxidizer tank pressure. your transducer hasn't indicated this, and there - there may be a problem _rith that transducer. we've got a procedure change that i'll give to you later in your flight plan update, prior to the mideourse 2, that will allow them to check that transducer."
"okay, we understand."
"well, the beck with it. 04 02 17 51 r_fp wait a minute. let me park the antenna where it should be."
glycol temp in -
"we've got number 2 reading 3050 and number 1 (tranq) is reading - 3000 and it drops down to 2990. (goss net 1) tape 80/4 so i'm not sure that it's really indicative that it didn't go. over,"
"okay, you've got it."
yes. it's 5000 feet per second. you're presently 2660 miles up.
stand by 1.
"42 degrees, babe. guide it in. 42; we're passing 3500. coming down at about 99 feet a second; you're looking good. about 15-percent fuel; i'll reset my watch here."
you've got it.
"and, jack, this is houston. we're seeing - looks like your water temperature's getting pretty high. you might want to go to intermediate cooling or slow down or something. looks like you're getting a little warm."
understand. don't worry about it.
"roger. reading you the same, now. could you repeat your burn status report? we copied the residuals and burn time, and that was about it. send the whole thing again, please."
"oh. (laughter) i_4p-eva that's good. no, that's good. that's perfect."
"roger, al. read you the same."
roger. that's all correct.
"gee, ..."
"looks like i'm about 35 percent, and i'm between inter_:uiate and min; and i'm at 3.85."
...
"orion, this is houston. could you give us a range and range-rate read-out?"

"wait, gene. wait, wait, wait."
"roger, dave."
"- - joe, we gave it to you but you blocked us."
"roger, apollo 11. thank you much for the show. it's a real good half hour. appreciate it. thank you very much. out."
yes.
"okay, we're right on the time line. right to the minute."
okay.
"okay, terminating battery a charge."
"a little bit. i'm getting him, though. tell him i've got a good shot of him."
okay. how about reading the voltage off of main a?
let me trim it up.
okay.
"and with that, i'm rolling out nv hammock."
"go ahead. n_u__-oo_v__/_ _cv okay, fred. recommend you _o to off on the biomed switch. we never did get any biomed and it might clear up the comma little bit."
roger. minus .1.
"*** before you go back *** down after a picture here. and i want to get a pan of this thing. *** stereo pan *** your radial sample. l_-eva *** you take the after from there, and i'll go over here and--"
"alright. you're on next, al."
"okay. you're going to trench right there, huh?"
"america, 17 - let's say it again - america, this is houston."
"let's see. okay. with 30 seconds of burn time, by my stopwatch there, i ended up ,{ith a plus - no, let's see - with a minus - minus 0.n x. i think 0 in y and a plus 0.5 in z. okay_ so i tweaked out the plus x and rolled :_ight 90 degrees and burned a 0.6 in a plus-y. ok_r. with final trim of - on the noun 85s of 0 plus 0.1 and a minus 0.1o delta-v c was a minus 110._ but we had that k not a minus, a plus 110.4. but there's no bias check at a plus 0.9 - on the bias."
"yeah. i see ab least two different colors of light, dark clasts. they must be at least - must be at least a three rocker."
"no, not too close to that wheel."
"hello, houston; this is endeavour."
that's affirmative. be about another hour and 20 minutes.
"al, can you clarify a little more exactly where you're photographing. i see a wrinkle ridge running northwest toward caroline herschel from _ the la hire rilles, so this is where i'd guess you're working. is that correct?"
"fairly light, but a sharp tap."
good show; everything looks good.
"apollo ll, houston. over."
"apollo 13, houston."
"okay, houston. you've got reac, narrow; pitch, plus 25; and a yaw of minus 185. how do you read?"
...
we'll wait a couple of minutes. it takes that long to settle down and give you a reading on it.
"yes, we are too, we're - got a little over 100 pounds today. got up the side of the mountain. got a good look around. things are going real well. oh, meu, it was super, just super. we got some great pictures for you. yes, i tell you, i hope you can see these rover tracks, because out- side the lm here, it looks like a freeway."
"flight bus, main a, ai_dflight bus, main b, two of them, open."
okay. copy that.
"you have it. 04 o0 42 26 lmp-_ okay, read that again, jim. the - the delta-v x."
"once we learn the trick here, i think we can do it each time. that may do it; that may do it, right there, houston."
"okay; 4 minutes and we're go here, bob."
"just sit back as you can now. can you hold these things for me, jim? hold those, too."
yeah.
question number 9 for dave scott.
give me the little white tool.
okay.
"how about a little burn abort rules, babe?"
"gosh, did you see that material disintegrate? hey, that cuts easy. now, which tube did you want to give me, pete? do you want me to hold one of those tubes?"
roger. milt says we owed you a review before every burn. are you interested in a quick runthrough of what happens at loi? tape51/2
"okay. cabin repress, closed. suit fan delta-p, open? 05 17 32 09 lmp-_ delta-p is open. cdr-_ suit fan 2_ open?"
"roger. you're about 5 minutes behind on the - the arrival time at the sep. but we're - we' re - no real problem. and i ass_ne that the range and bearing, when you got there, was about zero."
okay. why don't you set these numbers in the gdc?
okay.
"al, you take that little bit and we'll put it on the patch."
"they don't have a good up-link, gene. i - i had signal strength. and now i don't have any at all."
"okay. and, charlie, we'd like to press on with the closeout."
say again.
"even the kids at camp got into the news when mike jr. was quoted as replying ""yeah"" when somebody asked him if his daddy was going to be in history. then after a short pause he asked, ""what is history?"" in washington, president nixon is planning to use his executive power to stream- line the interstate commerce commission. accord- ing to industry sources, it was reported nixon would trim the commission from ll to 7 members by not making new appointments."
lift that ... up ...
turn your camera on.
"okay, dave. right below the ""verify the sim powerdown"" line there, i'd like for you to insert two lines. ""circuit breakers, bps pilot valves, two of them, open, and that should be a ""verify."""
all balls valves are off.
... back.
"okay, i'll put this - where do you want me to put this? right here - right in the footpad."
"and, jack, alsep says that that's okay ... but that's no problem."
"verb 06 noun 20; 3, 2, 1 -"
"okay, plss fan, on; vent flag, clear. %confideni"
...
"slow up. don't - don't - don't kick dust in the middle of my polarized picture area, here."
"we'll pick it up right here. 0nly got - oh, yes. well, we're a little behind, i think."
okay.
"roger. 05 22 47 24 _mp-eva hey, joe; i'm putting bag number 7 on the right- hand side of the tool carrier."
hold it. hold it down farther - down. it's got quite a bit of dirt in it.
(laughter) you care to have a little friendly wager?
yeah.
"yes. we'll hit that first. boy, that's a big mountain when you're down here looking up, isn't it? my oh myl this is as big a mountain as i ever looked up."
"well, i - i'll actually feel pretty good when they get a collar around this boat."
"flashing 53. 04 12 51 36 ia_p okay, let me get a y-mark."
okay.
"negative. we weren't trying to say anything, hank. he probably didn't get our initial call."
"okay, go ahead."
that's basically what we did.
they're all in. i'll get the pictures.
...
okay.
okay. copy that.
"good morning, commander. cdr-in how does america itself look?"
okay.
... i think we're starting to see blocks. that one is so - so unusual -
"okay, we'll get - -"
not the same.
"well, turn up the lights. i don't know what the hell -we're conserving electrical power or some- thing. i don't know whether i'm right-side-up or upside down in this danm inertial world. i could tell myself, though, right now, if i took a quick peek."

"yes - jack, where you been? irp-eva i fell down."
"pins look okay up here, dave."
"al, this is houston."
'fakea look at ed bats.
"well, thanks a lot."
you are clear but weak.
"hello, apollo 11. houston. i wondered if during the tei burn you utilized the oxidizer flow valve on the pugs. over. 05 15 55 06 ih5° yes, we did. based on your very excellent briefing i was expecting the thing to continue desiring increase for the whole time, so we started out with it in increase. i saw that we pretty quickly crossed the line and started falling about 6 or 7 percent behind, so i was still expecting it to move up, and then i went down to full decrease and brought it back down to a difference of 2 percent. over."
okay. we'll be dropping - dropping the up-link for 20 seconds. here we go.
orion; houston. 06 06 42 58 lmp-i_ go ahead.
okay.
"we've lost - the only advantage to doing it early; if we can power back - the lm back down. the only advantage doing it early is you can do a big burn now and a midcourse and then power the lm down. otherwise, we got to keep the lm powered up clear until we get around the moon. plus it would be inside on the burn. i just hope the g&n hangs up on - hangs in on this one - i'd sure hate to do that one manual."
"joe. okay, i get a flashing 37, i am in program 06. there is no standby light, but when i enter, i don't get the three balls 62 displayed like i'm supposed to."
okay. it's your computer. and i'm standing by with parking angles when you're ready to load them.
okay. and we're going on with the plss topoff right now.
"yes, you're facing right into the east."
...
"okay. on time; burn time was about 18 or 19 sec- onds. the residuals were minus .1, plus .2, plus .2; delta-v c was plus .8, and the g&n has us in a 59.4 by 10.b. time skip"

(laughter) okay.
"roger. roger. and we're ready to give you an up-link, if you'll give us p00 and data, please."
it says here _zou got to focus it. they don't tell you what the focus ...
"oh, lucky guess. i might say that the sub - the zero phase point that we're looking at is right at the northeast coast of australia, and it's much brighter. very - it's a very bright point now - oh, it's hard to say how far across. but, quite unlike what i mentioned being in the vicinity of the samoan islands earlier. and it's right at the shore, and it could be just that the shore area has somewhat choppier seas. so maybe - maybe the brightness of that point is a function of sea state, although i don't know exactly what type of seas it would take to brighten it up. i suspect choppy seas are better than long swells."
"no, you got to do it after. because that's the only way the computer gets its discrete."
he can do it with g&n controls.
okeydoke.

roger; auto. and i'm maneuvering for the next one.
i got bat in about 33-1/3 percent on that u_[[nk. too fast alarm.
"go ahead, houston."
_ okay. can you reach that?
"okay, dave. we're ready for the e-mod dump."

"and 16, se audio, open. okay. connect your plss comm. and when you get done with that, we'll go right into the comm."
"okay, charlie; 2 minutes."
how's it doing?
"oh, there's old 13. take 14 out, so we - put ... in the bottom."
"you've got it to 3 milliradians. you've got it to 2 milliradians. you've got it to 2 milliradians. now you've got it, ken. you killed it."
stand by 1.
(cough) if i remember my pad - -
"ken, still looks a little loose."
you bet your - life i am.
okay.
roger; we'll open the crossfeeds and close main sov a. we're configured.
0mni charlie.
i keep hearing a whistle.
that's what i'm doing right this second.
okay. got you.
"man, i can't figure out what the hell's"
that d - that drill is so good it - it's hard to get off.
"okay. okay; let's move down here. downhill, with care. now, it looks like the same - look down at the bottom of that crater - another little crater with a bunch of debris in it."
okay.
"oh, man, is it hard to get around here! ._-50 day 7"
let me grab that checklist again.
"okay. retract, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and about 10, i guess. okay, then i'm going to -"
...
read you loud and clear.
there's a lot of it jack. keep going.
"huh? yeah, it's locked - he's locked up. good enough."
and we're concentrating pretty hard.
"fredo, you're breaking up completely .... state- merit."
"notice the color of the material, chartie, in the bottom of it - it's white. we get a kilo of soil."
okay.
okay. let's see. i got a few minutes. why don't we talk right now?
okay. ready to copy.
"very good. thank you. 04 21 39 40 i/_p okay, houston. the magnetometer's deployed; it's level, and it's pointed exactly east. and the little black dot is right in the middle ..."
"mine's okay, too."
i'll check; just a second. yes sir. that's about 3 minutes and 30 seconds or so.
i think we - i think we probably disturbed that one. it'll probably show up in the befores.
"ken, what's the get?"
okay; fine.
okay.
"bob, we're at 253/1.1."
"roger. t-start, 106:56:51; t-stop, 108:55:19."
"we're only doing - got a b max, and we're only doing 8 clicks. so you know this has got to be steep."
think i have better luck holding the map backwards.
"- - gene. left eye, very bright spot; left eye, left side about halfway in towards the middle. that was the brightest one i've seen, and it was just a spot."
that's okay; you got it.
"yes, there's one - the only one i know of right now - i can get you one. i know where there's one. there' s a ridge here, jim. a prominent ridge - we're coming across. that's just ab- solutely striking. i don't believe it. ring sight. yes."
"no. 07 09 22 57 cml° okay, there may be a little shield on the mass spec is - the black. okay, do you see the gamma ray door? 07 09-23 04 _ yeah., t_a,t_,s_y_',_i_'t it?"
yes. you're in auto.
that's a beautiful picture with just an edge of the moon coming out of eclipse.
"five, okay. you got 5 there, *** got 2 and 3 on the rover, lcru blankets are open 100 percent, *** covers are closed. i want to - push that battery cover over there down just to make sure it goes down. l_4p-eva the warning flag is u_ ..."
"okay. and in - in the event that that doesn't work, we're standing by with the original scheme, a set of lm fdai angles to fly to that'll point the command module optscs at the moon and the sun; so we can always go back to that."
but it's necessary.
i'm going to get a shovel for the scoop. and i thought we'd maybe - and i'll tell you what i got to do is fix up a - start on a double core for the csvc.
it's going down. it's going down slowly.

"houston, i think itve got pitch and roll just about squared away. i let yaw just slightly drift; it's drifting in a clockwise direction and i'm about all set mow to put in my 12 clicks to the right."
"roger, houston. understand that and - one point from here, karl - i'm over the spot in imbrium, i think, close to where you and whitiker drew from or figured out, some lava flows coming out of where the wrinkle ridge is, and at this low sun angle, i can very clearly see some lava flows coming out of what appears to be a ridge, extending in both di- rections from the ridge. and i wasn't set up this _-_ time to take a picture of it, but it might be in- teresting on the next pass if we could get a - if we could get a pad to take a picture of that."
now to start back in.
understand; substitute for that minus 080.00.
"okay, which lens?"
"houston, we vented the batteries and it went to 0.4, looks - maybe 0.2 now."
"... 06 07 54 44 cdr-i24 okay, endeavour, falcon. you must be on the other side of the mountains and we'll just stand by until you get over it, because you are always broken over there on the other side. 06 07 55 12 cdr-i_m hi, endeavor to falcon. how are you? _ 06 07 56 bo cdr-lm endeavor, falcon. you're broken. how's this?"

"roger, jim. coming up on our tec partial gamma ray extension, and looking downstream towards that, we are requesting that you time the gamma ray boom extension, which you're going to do at 219 plus 19 - and we'll be standing by for that time. and also requesting - that you get on the biomed via the flight plan, please."
okay ....
i'll get it. thought i'd do it down at the door so i don't scratch it - -
"okay. that one's in, and the quantities went to 100 each."
"i did a star check, and it passes. it puts that star right in the telescope."
"okay, houston - -"
"okay, it did pressurize - 245 to 245."
yes. go ahead. try hitting - there you go. can you use the other end against the right side of the rock?
"all right sir, we've got one las5 thing for you to clean up. back on page 7-6 of your checklist, it looks like we may have skipped some s_eps on the gas return valve, and like to make sure thav you get to auto and the gas div_rter, pushed to cabin before you stow the oxygen hoses."
okay.
"okay, let's - -"
good night.
okay.
stand by 1.

we see you getting a hair bigger.
"okay, just move back so i can get the door, now. 07 00 05 07 lmp-_ go farther? go back in my little corner?"
i didn't get the lanyard. it fell off my head.

"what do you suppose that is? 05 12 42 02 _ hey, we can't - here's something interesting, houston. hey, it looks like a surface - what we got is what looks like kind of a semiburied rock. hey, there's a small piece of it over there to the left. see it, pete? we'll be able to catch it and put it in the bag."
i can move it over here another 30 feet or so. you'll be all right.
"if we're gonna do a reference sample, let's get that huge mass right there."
"okay, pete. i'm depressurizing the tunnel."
okay.

"what is your 02 quantity, by the way? (trm_q) 04 12 12 ll cde 02 quantity is about 91. (tha_q)"
"i'm not sure i copy your question precisely. haven't talked to - to your home today, at all."
"yes, i'd like to try to get the full amount. as i recall, tomorrow's a little bit flexible. if we get up 30 minutes late, it doesn't really hurt us."
"houston, how are you reading now?"
endeavour's ready.

okay. is that it?
yes. here you go....

"i just want to talk over a little philosophy here. fred told me that at one time you came up and told him that we were a little steep on the entry angle, and now our burn is going to make us - give us a steeper angle. i just want to make sure that we're all talking about the same thing_ that, in essence, at this particular situation, we're shallow s are not steep, and we are going to in- crease the angle."
sure is.

"is that what you meant, john? for permanent shadow? oy 00 16 51 cdr-eva yes."
(laughter) roger.
"yes, i'm sure we will. and i guess the thing to talk about now is our reasoning, our thought processes on having you proceed at 5 seconds, and then having a1 throw on both the delta-v thrust switches right after that. and let me go through it, and let you think about it then. the reason we want to do that now, even though we do have a great deal of confidence in bank b, but the sps engine thrust light - we have no visibility into that system as long as that light is on. and, if for some reason, since we do have this suspect system here in a, we don't want to take the chance with b. and when that thing fires off, we want you to be on a good guidance. you won't have to do anything as far as your guidance is concerned. you can continue the burn, and press -- on even though it - it may have ignited prematurely. it does require procedure change, and i think you and al think about how you might handle this, and - and come back to us. but those are the reasons we did want to turn either delta-v thrust on earlier than the point where you'll get good g&n- guided burns."
huh!
"didn't make it, huh?"
"yes, they tend to have fatigue failures along the cracks when you go to open them up. i notice the two bags that i put in the src yesterday - they're that way. and, let me get back here just a second; let's see, pass lec, etb transfer, geology prep, stow on htc; contrast charts, ex- tension handle, hammer, small shovel, and gnomon."

i don't know that this is representative too much of elbow.
"150, 4000, 195, 70. 00 00 24 39 _ good."
"what jack's done is he dug a - a trench in a - the southwest-northeast direction, and he discovered about 3 inches below - _ inches below the surface - a very light-gray material."
"and, houston, even at the high sun angle here, the ejecta of the - oh, four or five recent craters around maraldi, still kind of a bluish-gray, light-bluish-gray. the floor of the crater maraldi is essentially a dark - more of a dark gray today, i guess, than anything. and the ejecta patterns on that are the same albedo and color distinctions as the ones in the landing site. and, the landing site itself, from this angle, i think is going to - no, once we get up at the same viewing angle as we had on maraldi, the mantling material in the landing site is the s_me color, same albedo as maraldi."

roger. 02 07 52 24 i24p i can see the hatch and all the - all the eva handrails. first time we've seen the silvery outside of the command module. (goss net 1) tape 36/9
"oh, you might ..., i guess."
be sure and put a second on the tapemeter. it isn't closing very fast.
"we're finished with the e-mod dump, but we would just as soon get all these pads up, and we're not concerned about the landing site - down here."
"okay, houston; endeavour. going towards 30 degrees pitch."
"yes, it's bright, isn't it?"
yes; okay. that'll be fine. my mistake.
"just a second, pete."
"stand by l, jim."
... are?
we've got tv.
(laughter) we're having - i bet they having - don't have as much fun either.
"okay, i'm going to take a pair of tongs - -"
gimbal motors number 2. ready?
here.
"roger, jim. just wanted to tell you to expect all your updates on time except the pad; and we're going to delay the pad to 72 plus 50 because of very good tracking data we'll be getting in those last few extra minutes there."
okay.
"- - a couple of rocks. yes, sir."
sure we do.
"okay. that's still going to be mostly retrograde, it looks like. that's how i got in this place to start with."
we'll get you an answer to that.
"how about the orientation? were they all perpen- dicular to the surface, or did they all have a preferred orientation?"
roger.
oh.
okay. do you read al?
"okay, endeavour; this is houston. and we're ready for the camera cycling procedure now."
yes.
"ail right. i assume you got that. panel 5: circuit breaker imu, main a and main b, closed."
"casper, apparently it's necessary to load the nor- mal dap before you load the emp, because once you've loaded the saturn dap, the lm weight and that sort of thing will not be accepted by the cmc. so we'd like to have you take the _p out, load the normal dap, and then load the _ back in. we should of told you about that earlier, i guess. it slipped by."
"okay, we got it."
"roger. okay. flight plan updates for the coming rev and -there's several of them here. and just to keep you feeling a little bit more optimistic, on the following revs, there are very few updates. okay. at 212:40, we want to delete map camera image motion, increase. at 2 - -"
"okay. i don't think you'll need your hammer, but i'll get it anyway."
"okay. that's 1460, 77552; 1461, 77756; 1462, 77307."
"let her go, babe. 0oooh. 00 00 49 55 _ okay. okay. i'm down in the checklist to where - we've already done to gdc aline; we will unstow the sequence camera bracket and the ordeal. have you mour.ted the ordeal box?"
"okay, i got this result on the quick look on the x-ray. i just thought i'd pass it up to you. the descartes area is higher than - in alumin_ silicon than mare, but it's not as high as the highlands east of smythii."
"hard to get around here. i_p-eva bob, let's get it straight. you w - want -"
"fantastic. if you'll hold still, it won't fire any, once it figures out where the c.g. is. what a machine."
"11, houston. on that tv, our commentary - the monitor i was looking at was delayed about 12 seconds, 12 to 15 seconds while it went through our color converter. it was probably - you thought i was crazy, but we were looking at it 15 seconds after you broadcast it. 11, houston - -"
copy that. press on.
i've got 92. (tra_q)
"geno, i'd like to give you just one bit of inform- ation we just got from the simulator. _en you go from this new attitude i gave you - this verb 49 attitude right now - to the eva attitude, you will see a middle gimbal angle of 66 degrees. that's right off the simulator."
"ken, for your information, the ptc looks beautiful; in fact, it was so good, it took some of us quite a whise to realize you were in a ptc."
got it.
"columbia, columbia, houston. request po0 and accept, and we'll send some state vectors up to you."
"it's funny though. if you saw this on earth, you'd think it was a - a real soft dirt that had just been rained on recently."
can i get your gloves?
it's open and verified on.
okay. you have accept.
"okay. we'd like them open. and, jack, while i'm interrupting everybody here, how about a frame count, if convenient."
"oh, i'm sorry, i - -"
i don't know how you do that.
mark it. it's buzzing.
that's affirm. it was 0.6 and now it's down to - we been seeing it as about 0.1.
going low.
"i haven't stopped - _ haven't set it d,_wnyet. that's the first pieture in the panormna. right there. 04 13 59 z_5 cc roger."
go ahead.
that's what i saw out my window.
it's all those screws and -
"okay, we're at 40 minutes, dave. i'm going to get the ascent bats on."
"okay. we're going to dump with the mapper open, is what you're saying, huh?"
"that's a good one because it puts the earth out window 1 and the moon out window 3 and puts the sun down in the leb, so the lighting in here remains relatively constant."
"yes. well, it looks like the same texture, but it's got that flaky fracture pattern all over it. i'm going to get a stereo while i'm at it,"
"15, houston. you copy? we monitor good rates down here also. 12 06 19 58 cml° okay, houston. we copied, and we're testing ring 1 thrusters now."
"okay, ed, houston."
"okay, joe, while jim's getting that, i'm going to load the etb."
coming up on t-1.
"biomed, right; pcm, high; and updata link switch to data whenever they're ready."
you don't.
roger. as long as the threads pull - pull free from the hole.
you agree?
that's affirmative.
okay; 50.
roger. go ahead with the k-factor. (tr_q ) 05 02 28 27 co roger. 119 plus 59 plus 59.92. over.
i'm moving over to adjust the mesa.
roger. we're enjoying fredts music there.
"okay, stand by 1. hey, al. is that - just on the lens that rotates?"
two green on the lioh cans.
"fred, the focus is good enough that we can see the position of your four ball valves at the top of the picture for the big sps engine."
0op.
"suit circuit relief, auto."
okay. i'll start on - -
"i got it, wait a minute."
thank you.
why don't you put that here if you - can you read it here? so we can - -
you see it?
"roger. we want you to eliminate the line there ""audio mode to vox."" we want you to say - stay ics/ptt. for the ascent, stay in your present coii_configuration of down voice backup."
mark; 7 minutes.
"(laughter) well, after we got through with that first fiasco, we've been - rather meager - meager in our usage."
"apollo 15, we'd like to have omni alfa."
okay. sounds good.
...
"well, that's kind of - not ..."
"no, this is the mission timer. that - this was - this - yes?"
yeah.
yes.
okay. i even see some vesicles in it.
auto.
glad to hear it. (columbia
okay. thank you.
what's that?
"roger, 13. go ahead."
roger; understand.
"okay; good. why don't you - you zip the bag. and let me get that other big rock, that -"
"have at it. we'll take any words you've got. we expended all our questions a few minutes ago with john, and in fact i didn't even have to ask any; he just answered them all, so - but press on."
push cabin.
bob.
mark.
...
we're looking at 5.7 in the cabin.
"roger, al."
"that's plum? 05 03 11 28 i_mp-eva yeah. 05 03 !1 30 cdr-eva i ain't even on the rim. 05 03 ll 32 i2_°-eva well, it is; it's - yeah, it is, - it's right - we're - the rim is right here. we're on top of the rim."
huh?
"thank you, jack."
"that's correct. on 8-13, ""171 plus 30"" to ""175 plus 29."""
"well, let's see, this is east - looks awf - it's a double crater but it's much bigger than i thought rudolph would be."
"didn't lookbad, jim. i just looked at it."
"what would it be at the latest? l0 20 h9 12 lmp hey, gordy; jack."
"i'm heading out, dave."
yes. 03 10 04 13 _ yes.
okay.
are you ready to copy?
mode control.
... thing off.
this data file thing?
we ought to check that.
there. i've got charlie's shovel for scale for the before shooting.
"yeah, i do. i got it in standby."
"yes, we got just about everything else. we got into - maybe mixed up two meals, but essentially - meal b and c for yesterday were eaten, except for the corn chowder."
"right there, babe."
and the x-ray is on.
you should have been on time.
"dust, dust, dust, dust. here you are. i'll go ahead and get a closeup stereo - -"
"i get the - the idea that it's - it looks collapsed north to south, doesn't it? sort of looks elongate."
"hey, i thought we just got that off."
okay.
"roger. we're convening the cpcb on that change, fred, but flight has given you an interim go- ahead. over."
z of plus 0.9.
"okay, joe ...."
"well, hell, jack. ail you - you don't use a very good one ... just if you'll go ... at your atti- tude reference for ... and the g-meter backup. because, really, you can almost ... the command modmle and your odds are 60 to 40 that you're going to hit earth blunt-end first, without any reference. 03 2b 00 38 cmp ... i didn't realize that. that proves you've got a little bit above 50-percent odds that you're going to enter blunt end, and -"
oka__.
i think you copied it in the lm activation check- list on pa4e 1-13. 02 04 47 47 _ roger. 02 04 48 11 _ okay. i'm on 1-13 of the activation checklist.
here we go....
"okay; that - that stands to reason; that not being able to see the reticle on there is a real nuisance. you can do it, and it's - i guess there is also a certain amount of getting used to the knack of flying that thing around. it's - for some reason, it seems a little bit different to find the atti- tude than it was in the simulator; but the biggest nuisance was the inability to see the reticle, but if that's where we used our extra, that's fine."
"and, sure enough, just like advertised, there's no status lights on - dsky warning panel. and i'm gonna go ahead - if it's okay with you, i'll turn off the channel ll, bit 16. 02 07 26 b6 cc okay. go ahead."
up tel to block.
"roger. 214:02. camera configuration: 250 milli- meter lens, f/5.6 ..."
that's all right. that's got it.
"***, gordy. that clock checks with - with our time out of p63."
"well, that's pretty good. must be compensating errors along the way somewhere."
"and, geno, some advice to you on the gas pills. i guess - suggestion down here from the surgeon is that one thing we ought to be sure to do is chew the pills thoroughly. it apparently is - helps in their effectiveness quite a bit; and dr. young, beside me, also suggested if you're chewing chewing gum, you might cut down on that a bit because he thinks this might be causing some gas."
"okay. understand. that block between 21:54 - or 2 - 211 plus 54 and 212 plus 20, that - that all goes as - as scheduled."
roger; 2.25
how about some water?
got it. make sure of everything in here.
it's just like a refrigerator.
huh?
"oh, that's encouraging. 04 23 52 53 t_._p here's the jett bag_ dave?"
"aquarius, houston. over."
"yes; well, it's right there. yes, it certainly is. it's - it's moved from just a little bit west of luzon over to the coast there. so it's a pretty healthy storm."
"do you need the flight plan, dick?"
go. okay. let me roll a little bit over.
"okay. union, and i'll save item - this would be a good item for the drive-away."
okay.
"all right. verified we're in retract. ii':_ going ... 00 02 32 05 c}cp and done. 00 04 32 12 i_ about 4 feet out, houston."
and also an orange-grapefruit drink.
"fred, recommend that, when your window comes around facing the earth again, that you catch another one of those pictures, and at the same time, you should probably start ptc again. we might have sent a confusing bit of info up to you. the ""disable two quads"" only applies to an early step in the procedure. we didn't mean that for the latter part of the procedure where we have the statement ""enable all jets."" over."
"tranquility, houston. piea_ vent thc ff_,-i. it's increasing rapidly. ov-:. (goz.j net 1) tape 66/20 ioage 325 -"" 04 07 16 0_ cdr we show 30 psi in the fuel and 30 in the (tranq) oxidizer."
"dick, for boresight, draco beta."
sunrise. - - or sunrise or something that we saw. it was the biggest rainbow i'd ever seen.
"how about the moon? is it looking very big yet? 01 12 45 21 _ no, not really. bigger, but we've got a ways to go."
"the x-ray is at standby, the mass spec i0n source is off. mass spec experiment is in standby."
did you have that tape on board or is that just a back - but we've got the song again in our background here. or do you all have tha%?
"okay, houston. ptc is started now; looks good to us, and we'll be ready to copy in a minute or two."
"make sure i'm turned on there, will you, dave? my power on?"
"yes, okay."
"okay, sir."
*** on time.
he who laughs last.
"okay. verb 06 noun 20; 3, 2, 1 -"
okay. we'll start with a rock.
"it's been switched to low, houston."
"okay, we got get running."
"okay, we understand. you said that this area - the rocks in this area look different from what you saw. about how far west did that difference go?"
"okay; step 3, the second line, ""co_._aider audio, close,"" scratch that one. 07 23 25 30 dp okay."
"okay; fine, and i'm ready to start with the flight plan update. when you're set up to copy up there, i'll start at about 54:50. 02 01 28 20 _ okay, let me get to 54:50."
good.
okay.
"vox, and that's vox. how do you read the lmp, gordy?"
"- - advise that you will not have anm malfunction indication on any of your batteries now, but we can watch it from the ground. over."
"right on, dave - -"
"okay, gordo, how quickly should this tunnel vent?"
"hey, bob --"
hey - you - let me get this.
"yes, the cover is closed, and we want to turn the ir off, at that time."
"well, that's only 3 - that's only 3.3, john. why don't we go down a little bit further."
"21 nancy. c4 19 37 06 cdr (laughter) glad you're still with us, bruce. okay. break there. onfiden"
"say again, karl. i'm sorry; we were discussing the rille at that time - hadley, that is."
"casper, no need to acknowledge. your consumables look good, and, on the rcs, we're making a little money. we're about 188 pounds now above the rescue red line."
"okay, houston. here she comes."
roger.
i got it; i got it; i got it.
"yeah, they have a ... doing 360-degree yaws. ken's going to do one."
"it's beautiful, dave. either that or it's another esp experiment."
"let's see, you still have some sample bags on your camera, don't you?"
okay. i'll go ahead and accept that one this time.
yes.
roger.
"pgns mode control, att hold."
"houston, 15. go ahead."
- - cables in there.
"roger. from a propellant-balancing standpoint, we recommend that you use quads alfa and bravo to start the ptc maneuvers. over."
"and, 15, we have your torquing angles. you go to _-_ torque."
okay. going to look back.
looks good.
"okay, and i understand that was about 94 hours as i recall."
"okay. that's correct. the last change is cte, both open. over."
"for future reference, bob, the dome removal tool doesn't - it'll turn. shoot."
"okay, jim. we copy that. is that on the lsm?"
"aquarius, houston. go ahead."
"roger. 10 00 36 38 cml° okay. so out of that, i come up with a ""yes"" answer, and i'm going - looking at block 12."
what's that?
"okay. okay. they're sitting at off right now. ail 16 auto rcs switches off. lighting-lighting, off: interior integral light- ing, off; and interior flood lighting, off. over."
".,. 4 is 52."
two armed.
... that one.
which is the bottom?
att hold.
"roger. note: at 2 days 17 hours, the get in the mcc was updated. to correlate times from this point on, add 2 hours 40 minutes to those shown in this transcript to make them correspond to mcc get."
let's get it all taken care of. 03 08 23 31 _ huh? i ate mine.
on the stage switch.
"oh, boy l"
okay; very good.
"stand by on that and, while we're thinking about it, can we confirm that the only medication you've had is a seconal for you and a seconal for ron, and nothing for the commander?"
"okay. we recommend that for the first star, if we gave you a new state vector, we'd like to try the cmc-computed angles for your auto maneuver."
"what's the matter with - i'm going to try the other one. that thing, i can't even move. cml° oh! sticks or something. let's see. okay. let me try the other one."
roger. same here.
"yes, it's running, joe."
"it was- it's on the back, and it was - was facing right into the sun."
i think you may have missed a verb 66 - right there just after lm ejection. we need one now.
"well, that's the one t[ey wanted you to leave in. 03 08 5_ lo ]yl? ..."
okay ...
"okay, soon as gene - gene's drawing in the flight plan, there. that crater - okay, ready for a flight plan update."
"now there's that crater in the wall of that de- pression or *** near it. and it has one big block , in the side as if it penetrated the mantle and exposed some of the wall of the depression. *** about a 30-meter crater. valley of taurus-littrow is not planar."
"it's venting. ,:eittal _...._._..m"
okay.
"roger, dave. beautiful description. and, jim, you might - stop the camera now. it's probably run through the film load, and we'd like clicks and amps reading please."
"yes,"
"okay, we're in block."
still no reading on the motor temps.
roger.
say again about umbilical. all i get is umbilical. i didn't get the question.
"one of them is on the very back, back there with the flag."
"okay; a piece of the glass from it, bob, is 546. with a little of the local soil."
roger. out.
and deploy the charge. tell me where you're going.
"lots of - as we come on up toward cone, we're getting to seeing lots more buried rocks, bigger rocks."
"okay. read you loud and clear now, jim."
b. 08 08 21 37 _ ... is open.
"okay, you got everything?"
one moment here.
"go ahead 16. 10 08 01 o1 ia_ pete, we're busy with this entry stowage. could you keep us on the flight plan if something comes up."
"you want a sweep of one axis at a time? is that what you're talking about, hank? say like from - 125 to 135 in the - in the pitch_"
"yes, sir; sure will do, bob. we'll see you. what's our next aos?"
"cycle cwea, you said?"
"yes, ron. if it's not too much bother, it's one of those nice things to have. the pi would like you to take a picture with the - with the 35-millimeter indoor of the orientation of the heat flow as it's mounted. see if you can _et that, if it's not too much problem."
"they've got both of them right there, probably."
ac/dc on the old power .... to directs. uncage the old bm_gs. okay.
"that's correct, jack. okay, that's it. and i thirk we're about ready to go with this procedure whenever you are. 04 05 b5 28 cmp okay. first we got to go through that procedure to power the csm from the lm, is that charlie?"
"roger, dave. plus .2."
"hey, have you guys got a woman on board? 03 22 50 57 hip no way i could handle that."
seventeen - in a 15-second period. that's what i've been running; i've been checking myself. i used to multiply it out and then i said to hell with it.
okay. fine. 02 13 03 07 _ houston. how do you read the lmp?
"when i get a tei back, i'll copy it."
roger. understand.
"okay, ken. i wouldn't bother updating the time very much further because you're goin_ to do a clock resync here at 202:20. 08 09 14 22 _i_ okay. well, i stopped an hour too soon. '08 09 lh 34 00 ken, all you really need to do is, in the old - -"
"i'm not supposed to time it, am i_"
i don't really care. okay. 05 22 24 25 i/4p-lm hold right there?
"now there's a data point. just since the time i dusted lcru and right now, it needs dusting again. get some dirt in your eye, houston? yeah, hold still. there you go."
"okay, verb - -"
"and suit fan delta-p, closed."
- - we want number 5 on the hand tool carrier. · 06 03 10 37 cdr-eva 2 and 5 on the hand tool carrier. okay.
"get it so i can get the thing open. so i can get the first frame out, then we can get it. i don't know, it may gonna be a struggle all the way. 07 02 07 48 lmp°eva i didn't see it move at all."
you get one and i'll get one.
roger. understand; 5 plus 51.
- - that other one. gosh! look at - -
"no, there's an i - -"
... told you. i_4p-eva - - learned that.
okay. i'm glad i didn't have to earlier in the week.
okay.
"apollo 15, houston. i'm going to hold off reading you any pads at the moment until we can clear up our comm on the ground."
"yes, i got d-caldera into my sights now. the mound - ... in the center - are the same type of l material - same type of material as that sur- ! rounding the d-caldera itself. down in the caldera, the gray blocky-type of stuff - and you know what? i'd almost say that - you know how water drops kind of form on a - on a - on a sur- face as you - as you - have you ever had a high spot and something kind of slowed up - up to it, high spot - and water kind of flowed up to and didn't quite stick to it - you know it doesn't stick to it, all in one spot - -"
"i didn't do anything. 09 03 25 16 c_k° oh, okay. you need to go up about 3 degrees, then."
"okay. consumables update for get of 46 plus 00: minus 5.5 percent, minus 6.5 percent, minus 2.5 percent, minus 7.5 percent, minus 5.0 percent, minus 2 pounds hydrogen, plus t pound oxygen, and that minus 5.5 percent on the rcs total corresponds to minus 66 pounds. over."
"okay, we timed it pretty good."
"okay, you do that - and i'm going to get the hasselblad out for - this."
"how we doing time line? o0 o0 24 _ lmp we're a little behind, but it's the kind of stuff that we can catch up lickety-split with."
"look at me carry it! i'm carrying it over my shoulder! ha ha ha! 0b 23 44 17 lmp-eva i guess we don't have to worry about dust getting on it. 04 23 44 23 cdr-evb boy, 1/6g is the neatest environment you can find for this kind of work. 04 23 44 44 cdr-evb okay, charlie. i'm gonna put it over here by the - by the strut, and - just like it shows on my picture there, and maybe - maybe right even with bottom strut."
"roger. vhf cheek is go, ed. falcon here."
some of these are far from ...
"yankee clipper, intrepid."
"4900, closing at 5."
"boy, i'm going to tell you, when i get back from this flight, i'm going to be super shoulders after this suit."
okay.
"roger. 02 13 04 20 _mp okay, jack, we're going to have to back up on this, if we're going to follow the procedure here, which has us go mode control; pgns, auto, we're going to have to pull the tca breakers to keep from firing jets."
roger.
relay's going off.
"that's a good picture, fred."
"okay. would you give me get of o.05g again, please?"
"roger. i guess we'd like to get one more, charlie."
"sounds good, gordy. we'll just take her slow and easy when i get over there today and make sure we understand it."
"roger. at 214 plus 16, we change the el on to _ t-stop minus 140 to t-start 140. simply change stop to start."
"well, i'm trying to get around - trying to get out of the block field here, then i'll head back to the southwest. we going to sherlock at all, bob?"
"man, if we had landed anywhere but where we did, we might have been in serious trouble. i can't get over it. i'd have hated to work on any of those slopes."
good.
"okay, we copy."
jett.
"rog_r. copy 2.1. and while i'm talking to you on '_hisoxygen-tank pressure gage, it's starting to look like there is a bias in there of about 14.7 due to the fact that the reference chamber has ap- parently leaked its 1 atmosphere reference value do_ to probably vacuum. and that, coupled with a 5.-psimeter bias, should give you a total bias of about 20 psi on the oxygen-tank pressure. but the gage seems to be working okay except for that bias, so we're going to continue to follow it so we can give you a - maybe a better number prior to loi."
we got all the rock types that look different from any other rock type. ·
"well, damn, we've got to; it won't fire up the ecs for a while."
"let's finish setting up the rover, huh?"
"we had a lot of help down there, jim. (tranq) (goss net 1) tape 79/10"
beautiful.
"how you doing over there, stu?"
"say again, charlie. 06 00 53 28 i24p-eva i don't think this - these are rocks. i think it's a - if they are, they are very friable. z think it's just indurated regolith. 06 00 53 38 cc okay. we copy."
update the det.
they're very bright.
go. we're looking good so far.
"houston, we are now going to finish repressurizing the tunnel."
have - have - ask him to hold on.
"okay, got that one on - ... other side - looking good so far."
"at the time of tli, as i recall, you had 6 seconds longer than the nominal burn which was 3 seconds longer than the b-sigma iow burn, and you were also go for a second-opportunity tli if we had re- quired one."
"orion, request you select the secondary transmitter and receiver."
"and somewhere here along the line, jack, i guess maybe when you get those, you ought to stop and take the pan."
"ail right. 04 20 12 46 cdr-i_! hello, houston. good morning."
"america, houston. if you give us accept, we'll give you a new state vector. nothing much wrong with the one you've got, but we're just going to tweak it up."
"- - just reset it, and press on."
i got the wrong kind?
"okay, you got it? 05 22 42 0t lmp-lm it does a pretty good job at that. hey, john, we gonna have to - you're gonna have to turn around and get over next to your circuit breaker panel for me to get any water or - on - or anything. tape 9]/22"
you want me to move? you want to get over here?
"oh. well, i'll tell you, i've (chuckle) worn the toes through in my underwear here, so you do a lot of rolling around (chuckle). let's see - let's recapitulate here. in mag qq, we're on frame 104."
"yes, i see. ron was going to give me _ p30 pad and the flight plan says p47. out of _;hetwo, i prefer to go to p30, p41 route."
"yes, man."
"okay; copy that. and copy that you still have your cover gloves on today, right?"
"all these dark-halo craters in the - in that one picture by that little diamond we've got up there by yerkes. the one that's farthest to the south looks like an impact type of crater. in other words, you've got a definite ejecta lopping out around on those. the one that's hard to look at in the middle of my picture, but i think it's probably the second one down from the top. it has rounded ridges - rounded rims, and - coming up on the side here i don't know if i am going to be able to see it until i go by it. it has rounded - a rounded rim. the ejeeta pattern or the dark halo is about twice the size of the ... one crater diameter. and it doesn't - it's - it's either a highly eroded impact-type crater, or it's a volcanic-type structure. and, to me, it doesn't look like a highly eroded impact one. again, that's a little one we can probably pick up ground truth, so to speak, off of the pan camera film."
yes. i agree with you.
"all right, i'll tell you what. get all the lm stuff. give me the lm stuff right now. jack, give me all the lm stuff."
"hello, houston; clipper here."
"okay, i'll come back to you in about lo minutes with all that."
"about, yeah."
"hey, lift up your plss."
okay.
"0.5; okay, 0.7. pag5e66 izj'*"
"that says that d-to-a ain't it. l0 00 58 54 _ yeah. you can see, this - this ain't at all conclusive because this is all - -"
"okay, al, and you might - why don't you come up here and let me show you what the jets look like when we fire the ... 00 o0 50 lh cmp oh, okay. yes. let me - let me check out a quick star here."
...
roger. and you can expect some different omni calls as we go los and aos again.
okay.
"let's go to panel 16 on page 17, second row. it's ""asa, ooen.""_ i'm sorry. _=_'s_back u_ sne. it's ""alia,open,"" first, then ""asa."" 07 23 i_220 lmp yeah; okay."
"boy, you sure get a different perspective in this thing in zero g. right now, neil's got his feet on the forward hatch, and he (:an with his arms reach - all five windows, lie can reach down into - the leb where thc over- board drain is. he can practically reach over in the cockpit."
"okay. we're going to talk to the states, here, in a few minutes. _¢_at are we going to do, since we're ahead a little bit, what do we do - -"
"no, i didn't throw your camera away."
probably shut down before we took off (laughter).
"roger. go $head, houston."
plus 109.
"okay, you're fn _erb 76. there you go, and you're clear to mark. 04 00 55 36 i_mp two, three. okay, now you go to the other axis, so that's four. okay, that was a reject."
how about if i go ahead and put the gamma ray out?
okay.
"there were - patterns - like i haven't even seen in textbooks. maybe i haven't been looking enough, but some of the desert and grassland pat- terns were - had the appearance of ice crystals almost, except on a megascale, if you - have ever looked at ice crystals in sand."
"go ahead, jim."
"houston, endeavour."
"ed, *** 04 18 00 31 lm_ great. 0h 18 o0 36 cdr okay, the lens cap is going on now_ houston, while we set up the tripod - move the tv to another location."
roger.
"okay. now we got the fillet, we got the soil; now we need to sample the rock."
roger. understand. (tranq)
he'll understand.
"yes, i'm reading 3.8."
"okay. just a second. now, let me hold this end and you stretch that end out."
okay.
"okay, it's on the backhand - back side, bottom ihalf, left-hand column, about an inch up from the bottom."
oh - ooo.
"all right. the doors are open, and it looks like they are going to stay up without any problem."
"tell you what, if you want to even them up, we can crossfeed during this burn."
"okay, 15. the first change is in the entry check- list, second page; and, on page 1-2, we wish to delete step 21, which is the ""dsky condition light test."""
i was sure proud to hear that big bang.
"okay. at 145:14, this is a minor change in that mapping camera photo pad. the longitude there, where it says ""159.9 degrees to 20.7 degrees west,"" that should be ""23.7 degrees west,"" and it's just for your own information; and that's two and a half revs."
"fred, we already got that story for you, pretty well in hand. we're reviewing it right now. and i'd like to defer that question until later on. basically, we're just going to shut down and take what we got, and we got a midcourse of about - the maximum of 5 foot per second, anywhere in the burn to get back to free return. that - thatts basically the story. we'll give you the mission rules for this burn momentarily. i'd like to proceed on to page 18, at minus 1 minute, scratch ""master arm - on."" stand by. 03 03 14 07 i24p okay, on page 18, and i've already done that at 1 minute; ""master arm - on,"" i'll scratch - -"
"roger. an_]just - that's a verify. 05 08 13 11_ cmp ()kay. got that. 0_ 08 13 ]5 cc okay. ]_eallywhat this does for you, then, is it gives you a pr_ssure - a tunnel pressure integrity - or a hatch pressure integary - integ- rity check with a i)el'2£-t _ of 3 psi between the tunnel and the cabin. and then you never go on to the steps of ventin_ that on out. you just leave it in there for the time that you separate from the lm. and that gives you a shotgun dei,ta-v effect."
roger.
"i've got this bag of rocks on me, here. want me to bring them to you in a minute? iconfidenti"
cut-off.
okay. we copy that. thank you.
"dave and jim, i think that actually you'll have to write very little down, just file a few things away in your memory, but it's going to follow naturally, and i don't think there's any major complication here. most of it we can - do use a checklist and your knowledge of the front and traverse rationale, and i'll just take it from the top, if you're ready. 05 19 43 28 cdr-i_m okay, we're ready."
"okay, jim. you got it. we're crossfeeding system bravo - -"
got her.
yes.
what did we say we're going to stabilize at?
"hey, does that - do you want the probe right away, jack?"
"... take the logics, off, and ... again. 07 09 32 55 _ oh, no."
"plus all balls? no, you - there you go, plus."
"drive enable, forward ... time-1. take it nice and easy. here we go at time-2. and that is both; i know that. that's secondary. okay; steering, go forward to a - - _i°-eva boy, it's hard to see in that sun."
"roger. instead you want that ""switch on to gray."""
"yeah, charlie."
i can't believe we - -
(sneeze)
35559.
"oh, okay."
- - you might want to get the waste management compartment vent prior to glove donning. that is your decision - your choice on that.
roger. we found that one.
...
...
"15, this is houston. how do you read?"
"okay_ jack. the flight plan update has a couple of items in it_ and the first one we'd like to do is to update the tephem values in the g&c check- list on page g/9-2. these are fairly small changes, but in case you need them, we'd like you to have the exact numbers. over."
"and at 16, cabin repress breaker, closed."
"16, houston. charlie, i got a new set of torqu- ing angles for you. 08 o1 12 12 l_ okay. stand by a second. 08 01 12 26 ipp go ahead, hank."
"okay, gene."
what did you do with that bag? 06 02 44 lb cdr-eva i stuck it on the hand tool carrier so it - 06 02 44 15 _mp-eva that's right.
"yes. because we got a 270-degree roll, our pitch and yaw needles are reversed."
"okay. we copy that. scb-5 in bag 5, and it weighs 14 pounds."
"okay, fine."
"yeah, right."
heys i've put on some new sensors. how about seeing if your friends over on the left there are happy with that.
"why don't you go rate/rate now, before we ..."
"no, why don't you save it. let's document it. it's - -"
"roger, karl. i can vouch for the rocks and the blocks in the bedrock in the rille. i can see it from here with a binocular. i didn't have much luck picking up the rover. i think i got a - i think i got a look at the - at the lm again through the binocular - but i wasn't real sure."
"okay. verb 63 noun 12, option 2."
i don't know.
"and another thing we're going to photo is the scoop trenches, f:8, 5 feet, at 2."
"jack, you might just as well go cold water. there's no more use for it now, if you're warm."
"yes. i'll leave it right there. it really is annoying, isn't it?"
0.2.
there you got accept.
beautiful. greater than 4 - -
"roger. circ, sps/g&n; 39293; plus 0.49, plus 1.22; 097:40:17.16; plus 0068.1, minus all zips, minus 0058.0; 000, 142, 358; noun 44, 0067.4, plus 0051.6; 0089.5, 0:05, 0078.0. the rest of the pad is na. set stars, sirius, rigel; 131, 071, 014. two jets, 16 seconds; quads bravo and delta. end of pad, and the computer is yours."
"if you got enough, i'll go back to po0. 0_ 14 02 14 lmp did you do that? 04 i2 02 15 cc stand by. 0_ 14 02 18 cdr yes, i did."
"okay, babe. take care."
"roger, jack. preliminary data indicate that you are about as nominal as you can be."
"yeah, we see palmetto. coming down the ridge now, we look like we're going into a - a - a big sag- type area. it's at 12 o'clock of 300 or 400 meters, and we're now at 188 at 0.4."
"okay, you've got about 23 minutes left, here."
"okay, are all of these rocks looking pretty much the same?"
"yes, man. you back off on the power, it keeps right on going."
"okay, and cabin repress valve, closed on the panel."
"i see charlie over - charlie's down - down there to the southwest. can i go reset on this thing to clear these numbers off before 2 minutes? 05 00 41 5_ cc yeah, we can go reset."
okay. here goes. *** did it. *** do it again? okay. and then it says - -
"i don't think we're going to need a chart solution, but i'll take the numbers down anyway. ]"
"hello, apollo 11. houston. over."
"okay. 06 23 51 23 l_,_p-eva i guess you ought to stick the tongs in, and we ought to document this."
"this southern and southwestern pol_ion of seren- itatis has a general appearance of the sculptured hills, although the individual hills seem to be more widely spaced than around taurus-littrow. once again, historically, we're passing over the landing site of apollo , or near the landing site of apollo 15."
i san reach it. have to push these back - watch your footl
go ahead.
"well, i have done it before, but it's not easy."
"cb caution/warning, main a, closed. 05 06 50 115 cc that's correct. on panel 3: ac tnvewi'ei{, ac bus 1 and 2, res_i' and back to the center. (j506 51 09 cml' ac inverter, bus 1 and 2, reset then center."
now let me show you a view looking the other way.
yes. there are two or three of them right at the base. 05 03 38 47 i2_p-eva yes.
"0k% _, i got it that time. 176:44:33.91; 178:37:00.00; plus 057.1, plus all halls; plus 0404.6, plus 0517.0; plus 057.1, plus all balls, plus 001.3. over."
"okay. it's time to run the radar check, it's been in _ater a minute. okay .... closet, okay. heater for 21 minutes. power. okay_ a - transmitter a and she is reading 2.8. okay."
th_j's affirmative. it's a good attitude.
we're reading you 5 by.
"roger, ed. i was i minute late on that - on the mapping camera. we got it started at i - at 174:51."
flashlight. okay.
"jim, we're having trouble verifying your water off."
8 minutes. (laughter) we'll settle for that.
"okay. now, fred, that was good in the checklist. that's all. we'll have the powerdown checklist for you momentarily, and we'd like to ask you if you plan to use the dps burn card. if you do, we have some changes to that. over."
"the attitude is good, ken."
"roger, ron. you look good. you're breathing. 10 12 52 h6 cmp i'm breathing, huh? .okay."
i am.now: but i wasn't.
yes.
okay; 343. 'rape 96/h6
roger. copy 36.5.
a_d we have the usual couple of parker valves.
okay. that's right. you're getting a radial sample. that's fine. i forgot you were doing that.
"it has both a different color, and i think it has a different slope. but it looks just like a high- water mark on them, because everything around here is _liform."
"sure is, karl. no question about those mountains being there and where we're at with them. 03 07 25 _l cc they stand up on your horizon, do they?"
"what a flying machine this is, ken. okay, 400 feet; we're going to 4."
ail the data?
...
"we are still watching your cabin pressure down here. could you check for us, please, if the plss fill valve is securely closed? imp-im yes, it was closed."
okay. we're showing about 5.2 right now.
htuh?
"yes, sir. okay. get this little strap on here, and we'll be all set. okay. i will not steal the pen. okay. where is it? all right. okay. around here, you mean? that looks clear in the back. put your head over here a second. that looks clear. that looks good. yeah, that's - the little skirt around the back gets in the way .... i didn't hear it click. no. want to take the lewa off so we can get more pressure on it? goes on so much easier than it comes off. that sounded good. okay. that about in the center for you? okay. lock it. that's good. covered and all buttoned up. hey, that was easy."
"okay. skip one, and we want fuel cell 2 main bus b talkback, gray; and_ the next one, we want fuel cell 3 main bus b to off. over."
yes.
"... because when you do load those constants, we want you to load nominal values from the data card."
"*** twisted this time *** off. lsr°-eva oh, let's see if old twinkletoes can do it."
"orion, this is houston. 07 11 22 45 _,? go ahead. 07 !1 22 48 cc roger. it's going to take some load to dry out that wa_er boiler_ so, don_ do step 9 yet. ymd, we're thinking of bringing some more equipment back on to reduce that dryout tirade. over. 07 11 23 09 f2_? roger."
"well, it meant that it was pointing about plus or minus i degree. but it seemed to be pointing at i degree about the desired axis."
roger.
(laughter) okay. what do we do with these logic power switches ?. don't they go back to off now?.
"15, this is houston. on your ptc, when it -- started out, it looked okay; but we find that it's diverging now, and we're going to have to reini- tialize it. we suggest that this time around that we use a - a rate of .375 in noun 79. that might help."
(laughter) son of a bitch never gives up_ ices he? 05 23 10 44 _ he's always got an answer.
*** a lot of bags?
yes. do it while you're facing that way. just hang them up. got time to do it. ail you've got is water.
"okay, houston. the ed bat are 37 and 37."
"yes, that ought to do it."
"odyssey, houston. we'd like you to, on your comm configuration, go to primary power amp off, low bit rate, and downvoice backup. over."
they are going to get a lot of nice - they're going to get a lot of nice rock samples today.
"okay , no, we don't expect it until you get on the lcru."
"okay, i got a - -"
roger.
"pitch down. we're going down. i just put in one click down, ken."
"that's a roger, jack. you guys might also be interested, here in the houston area, all of the ground voice or air-to-ground is being carried on fm stations a hundred percent of it. and kuht, the television station, will cover the - educa- tional tv station - is going to cover 100 percent of the evas, all three of them, for all the time."
"okay, america, we show you inside of 20 minutes, saying you have a go for circ. cml° houston, america. roger. we'll do our best."
what is it?
"okay, are you with me'.'"
"tranquility base, houston. we'd like some estimate of how far along you are with your eating and ., when you may be ready to start you eva prep. over."
"roger. if you're ready, dave and jim are ready to activate the comm now."
have you seen ... out there?
"hey, wait a minute; we got the damn clock running at ih. how about that? can you give me a mark on 157 ... it's beautiful."
okay. switch to 200. o3 o9 58 k0 lmp 2oo.
(laughter) they'll never publish it. (laughter) 03 lo 57 o7 sc ...
*** disconnect your lm 02 hoses.
let me go get the tv _ _
"15, this is houston."
where?
"hello, houston. how do you read?"
i wish i wouldn't lose - start concentrating. i'm forgetting to take my pictures.
did you want this tv - a lower one? 04 07 44 i9 lmp it's got tv mount on it.
"(laughter). and, tony, this rock here looks like the same as - it's the same character as the ones up on the rim."
roger.
okay. suggest either magazine r or magazine s from a-13. transfer all of this to the i_mand recommend the following settings: l_/dc/80/bw 3400 (f:5.6 at a 250th).
"hello, ron. how do you read?"
"i did. sorry about that (laughter). oh-no. okay, where's the camera? yeah, get my - i've got to get my umbilical up here first, john."
"okay. that's good, then."
"that is amazing. hey, houston - - tape82/36"
pro.
"that's the activation one, c""narlie. 04 01 12 56 t_mp go ahead. give me yours. i'll put it up for you. '-'' l"
"yes, i got the purge valves right now."
"dave, are you arriving at the lm, now? - -"
"okay, ron. we copy that right from the flight plan change."
"okay, we're about there, go ahead."
...
"i was just looking at that dirt on that hatch down there. 07 09 04 b4 cmp okay, i see you; you are a little white dot. 07 09 04 37 lmp/cdr yeah."
"right over there is station 3, i think."
"okay. average g, 20 seconds."
"45.3, is that right, al?"
i guess - i guess now gnomon is a lm.
"okay_ if you just clicked to 4, let's go to 6 then, just past the click on 6. lmlp-eva 0ka__. and foe want about 080?"
looks about right on to me.
"okay, jim, ready for the k factor."
"that's good, dave."
okay; fine. i chewed one after brea_kfast.
"okay, john. you're where you have a hot mike."
okay. if i do it that way -
okay .... fill on the repress at this time.
okay; i want to assure you it was no big problem as far as the burn goes. no great loss there.
verified.
no problem. did you unplug your ekg blue lead?
"i think, initially, we've found most of it was - up near the coas mount and behind the panel on the left side - near - near the forward part of the window. we found several - several larger pieces there and also one large piece just above the data file, which was about an inch long or so. the small pieces seem to have been drifting all about."
okay.
okay. it's deployed.
is the water sep comp light on?
"what are you photoing, al?"
"okay, houston, we'll try to pick you up on the high gain."
i'm going to go get a gravimeter reading.
"okay, surface checklist, page 3-4."
"ah, ah. beautiful. hey, let me get some of that clod there. no, let's don't mix them- let's make this a special - one. i'll zip it up. 06 o1 43 36 imp-eva okay."
ok_. just now calling the verb 82. it's 67.4 by 62.8. okay. let me give you a little b'_rn report here - -
roger.
"suit fan, select number 2, and i'll get that. ecs caution, h20 sep component lights on."
"there are your tracks. look at that, john. how far - see them back over there?"
hang on a minute.
yes.
i guess i can pretend like i hear it.
"roger. 86 hours, ""manually pressurize the sps ."""
... found this mistake.
i can't see into this.
"okay, i remember your commenting that when you were w_lking to the alsep, i think, jack, in fact."
"did you get that, bob?"
"houston, we're locked up. how do you read? wait a minute. they may not have high bit rate yet."
"ail right, here."
think that'll go under it?
...
okay.
"copy that. what's the first battery temperature there, gene?"
"roger. we need to redo the refsmmat update that we gave you a little while ago. could we have po0 and accept, please?"
"tony, you just went by my window, and that half-earth, man, is a spectacular sight."
"yes. could you undo my eva antenna, please?"
okay.
"houston, neil. how do you read? (tra q)"
"0nboard state vector, in the event that you did a burn? 06 i1 28 40 cc oh. what you want to do is - is go on into p40 and stay in p40, and then trim - trim your residuals under - out on the g&n."
"hello, aquarius; houston. do you read? over."
"oh, isn't there another star that's in that area?"
yeah. after a bit - soon as i defecate ....
"roger, jim."
"tony, i'll say one thing, that the character of the regolith has really changed between here and stone mountain and - -"
at least the equal thereof.
"okay, very good."
average g.
"orion, this is houston. how do you read?"
"huh? it says, ""stow ops hose, actuator, and flaps. verify 02 off."" ""report ops to houston."" we did. ""remove from a-7 to stow in u-2: two helmet bags and one accessory bag, and the cabin fan filter""; that's ""if required, if required."" then it says, ""remove a-9 rock bag and temporary stow."""
that's really beautiful. talk about organization_
(sneeze) mm wmt
"i mean, i'm reading about 80 percent."
"okay. i dropped - i dropped it onto the strut; part of it fe - broke off. i'm sorry. okay, tidy mesa blankets; i've done that. big rocks, i've done. i'm ready to clean emus and stow antennas."
roger. thank you. 04 08 12 10 i_ okay. i'm going to voice backi_.
"okay. on the heat flow, it's continuing to work perfectly. it's stabilizing out and, at the present time, they show about a degree centigrade per meter gradient. apollo 15 is stabilized at about 1.8, and it looks like the 17 site's headed for about the same, which gives consistent data for the two sites. it looks like that's what is going to result when it reaches final equilibrium. and so that - if you call that - those two sites typical of the moon, then that leads one to the following conclusions; that that data requires that there be a total greater abundance of radio- active isotopes on the moon as compared to the earth, so there would be an implication here for a fundamental difference in the composition be- tween the two. and the higher number of isotopes would in turn require that they be located very near the surface, implying substantial differentia- tion of the material, at least compositionally or stratisfaetionally [sic]. it's not necessary that it had have to be stratified. it was only re- quired that it be stratified in most of - in that most of the isotopes be concentrated in the upper layers of the moon. i guess that's about what we've got on the heat flow at the present time. over."
"actually, it'll be all right with one strap prob- ably. it won't - -"
"yes. 06 02 12 54 irp-eva - - if we're going downslope, i'll just hang on."
coming at you; 1 second.
"okay, we copy that, and we'd like a battery mani- fold pressure reading. that's 7-a on the selector down there. seven alfa."
careful.
"okay. under rev 17, i've got a note - a similar note, ron, for rev 17."
"houston, this is 15. we were just looking at the urine transfer device, and that valve was in the op_ position, although the device wasn't capped."
we've got plenty of radar. we're going to do it.
"roger, joe; copy. plane change plus 2 sps/g&n; 66313, p_us 1.23, minus 0.12; 080:29:13.47; plus 3189.4, minus 2437.0, minus 1356.5; 175, 079, 332; no ullage; and that burn equals sps docked."

"ali right, sir."
"ho, ho, ho. tricky fellows. i guess you're right."
roger.
"not just yet, jack."
okay. same here. roger.
"hello, apollo 11. houston. we've got some sw[tc?i positions for you for the high gain. over. 02 10 19 33 _ okay. go ahead."
okay.
"we'll hang in there, t. p. you know nobody likes a pitching deck, not even a navy captain."
okay.
mark. tight limits. we're at 200; unbalanced; jiggling around a little bit; decrease.
a couple of football-size rocks.
okay.
"oh, i've got new bags. i've got new mags. i've got everything cleaned up and -"
"we're - hank we're down to the tv and dac prep, and we're just before installing the meter covers."
okay. what's the fuel-to-oxidizer delta-p?
"okay; since you don't do just - lpm, john - and i'm gonna do the 500, i won't put your bag back on. okay?"
"let's see. i guess the last thing i heard was ""are you there."" (laughter) 06 09 21 _8 cc yeah. houston standing by. 06 09 21 54 cm_ right (laughter). and at about 155:30, we go to free, take p20 and narrow the dead band to 2-1/2 de- grees, then go back to auto. we take the vhf, ver- ify vhf panels are all three to receive. we take the _f am a, off, the vhf am b to duplex, the ranging to range, and the antenna to right."
"okay, delete that ""telemetry biomed - off,"" and two lines later, it says ""recorder - on."" delete that line also."
okay.
"descent engine command override, off."
okay.
what?
"roger. go ahead. (columbia) 04 14 18 c.6 cc roger. p22 landmark id, lm: t1, 110 26 56; t2, 110 32 06. three miles south; time of closest approach, 110 33 40. shaft 353.855, trunnion 46.495, roll zero, pitch 250, yaw zero. over."
huh? 06 05 22 28 l_-eva reset the nav.
roger. it sounds like a good plan and you can use your ttca in min impulse to take care of pitch and roll.
it's free reeling.
"okay, we got the 93s; you're clear to torque. apollo 17 air-to-ground voice transcription"
"okay, and i'm sorry i skipped over a question here. dave, where is the drill vise and the drill treadle right now, as you remember. 05 08 57 _8 cdr-lm the drill vise is next to the second probe, which is the western probe, and the treadle is at the point at which we parked the rover."
yes. we're pointed down pretty much. we're (eagle) going to be up - -
okay.
"oh, this makes me mad."
okay.
okay.
"well, ... there's no way we can get ahead. then we got to do it anyway. defecate."
roger. that'll be after the eva.
"pete, go ahead. 04 20 19 3i cdr okay, the flag is up. we hope everyone down there is as proud of it as we are to put it up."
"okay, on this battery compartment problem. the reason for it coming back up so rapidly right after you vented is that there is pressure built up in the batteries. and when you vent the com- partment, the - the batteries simply then are venting to a very iow pressure or see a very iow pressure. and they tend to - to vent very rapidly for a while until you get the pressure built back up, and then they vent at a much slower rate."
"you bet your life. i'm reading 085/1.4, and that's what my checklist said."
"this country is so rolling and lmdulating, fred, with rises and dips everywhere, that you carlbe going by a fairly good-size crater and not even recognize it."
...
"(laughter) i was kidding, ...; i was kidding. verb 48, enter."

the one right there.
okay. it's gonna undock at 96:13 even?
3000.
"roger. you have it, houston."
iv gloves.
yes. 04 20 14 10 lm2 goes right in the ground.
okay.
"okay, my ascent eca control is open."
yes.
"and, houston, as we all suspected, it has one cock on it, or it had one cock. now it's fully cocked. and the handle itself is free swinging. the plunger has depressed, oh, ,lmnst three-quarters of an inch from the top. and it is no longer parallel with the surface."
"okay, well, that's rounding off to the nearest - -"
let me make sure here. we're standing by.
huh?
"yes, that's good work up there, al."
roger. thank you.
"roger. they're in the same position as the antenna right now; plus 15 degrees pitch and - no, now wait a minute. i got them - got it at about 275 instead of 265."
there go the drogues.
"yes, it's pretty easy to break up; it's really not very coherent at all."
boom clear. 08 03 23 23 _ straight out. boom's clear.
"mark it. 04 09 16 29 _ three minutes to go. correction, 2 minutes to go, jack."
roger.
okay.
"okay, we've got delta at horizon check attitude. r cc roger. and if you'll go over to 2-4, entry checklist, where it says, ""yaw back to zero degrees"" after sep, we would like you to insert, ""select 0mni charlie"" - omni charlie, at that time. and that will be also required on your entry cue card at 45 minutes where it says, ""yaw to zero,"" you'll have to be omni charlie, select omni charlie."
that's affirmative.
(laughter) right.
"and don't - don't forget on that activation cheek- list that one of them has that ecs stuff, and the other's got - make sure we have both of those. yes."
"yes, if you want to take a look at it, i can plug it in here. i'm on jack's headset now, but i can plug it in if you want me to."
"aquarius, houston. go ahead."
verify it's locked.
"let's see. okay. hinge pin out. i'm going to get you the tool. maybe you can reach it, jim, - maybe i can reach it. hey, jim."
okay. you got it?
okay. just a second. you caught me without my book.
wait a minute.
"if there are no pgns, we abort after high gate - unless after high gate."
"on this rev. 07 00 10 05 imp oh, the rev ..."
"and i think, bob, we're coming around different omni, so i'll wait on the rest of it."
"hey, just so that we know, it is about midnight, right?"
okay.
"ckay. age '"" unhuenz imlb"
"dave and jim, houston."
off. it's right here.
"dave and jim, this is houston. our data shows no leakage of water at all. we suspect that the little puddle you see on the floor is about all the water that's dripped out there."
"doesn't say to in the plan. hey, dick gordon? now, where the hell did that strap go? there it is."
"okay. we're ready for that, and we'll - -"
"apollo 15, houston. over."
"looks like we might have stuck the rear pad in a crater back there somewhere, huh?"
"okay, houston. my circuit breaker's armed - or closed; sequential logic, two, on and up and we're ..."
"al, i have a couple of questions from ..."
1400 degrees.
"every flight has to have some disadvantages, i guess."
"about 5 min - 4 and 1/2 minutes to los now, ron. we went around the room, and all systems look good and you're just looking great. cml° okay. mighty fine, i'm feeling pretty mood."
roger. out.
"okay. understand. stay for t-2, and go for the dps vent. let me get out of - okay, we can't hack that. i'm going to get out at 12."
*** got all your tg readings?
"challenger, houston. c_ cabin pressure is okay. we'll go ahead and take her on down."
okay; stand by.
one more core.
*** picture of that?
"oh, good show. okay, in the g&c checklist, per- form steps i through 4. after the rates are damped in step 5 under the ""auto rcs select,"" use b/d roll and d3, d4, c3, c4 jets. and you might just sort of write this in at the side - not cross anything out because lateron you'll go back to the normal procedure."
"yes. we don't to - we want to terminate the waste stowage vent at that time, because we think that that vent is what's contributing to our ptc coning."
"that's affirmative, and immediately following that, ""start emio509."" 02 19 39 38 cml° okay, henry. i guess i don't quite understand the loading the - the verb 48 into 21101, and then the next thing we do is to load a three in there. could you have someone give me some rationale on that?"
"if you can snap a picture of it, we'd appreciate it."
about 21 hours and 52 minutes.
"houston, this is apollo 17. go ahead."
"roger that, jack. booster says that's great. he says the booster's doing its thing normally. con- cur. we don't see much on the television at all."
- - light ... really·
my start time is 160:41:22. is that correct?
i got it; i got it. the pills kit - here's the pill kit. let's throw the pills in and leave the kit here. there you go? just a minute -
"i don't know. wait a minute. think it's to the ... 05 o0 04 21 i_mp-eva man, i tell you_ if my - if this - my christmas stocking looked like this etb, i'd be saved. okay, magazine p, the x is in the - in the middle, and the frame - the frame is lined up."
"okay, must be. captain young here wants to tell you that it's raining outside; and the paperboy apparently hasn't come in yet. omni delta, please."
"residual pgns were plus 0.1, minus 0.1, and minus 0.3."
they are.
yeah.
nothing.
i'll get them. i'll get you the tool e down if you kind of watch your feet for a second. o0 00 23 1h cdr i don't even know - i know - what am i kicking?
"okay. the next one, we want main bus a reset to off; skip one, and we want fuel cell 1 main bus b talkback to gray. over."
"okay. one, two, *** down, three, and the bootee's down."
"okay, karl. i got a few numbers for you on the extension time. we started the whole thing off at 84:06:30 and got the covers open, the mapping camera extended, and the extension was about 3 min- utes instead of 4. and we deployed the g,_ma ray and the mass spec booms for a barber pole plus 2 seconds. the g,mma ray - turned barber pole after 6 seconds, and the m-ss spec turned barber pole immediately. and i was suspicious of the mass spec, so we tried it again and got the same results. turned the x-ray on at 84:15:10 and the laser altimeter on at 84:15:30."
"okay, i got that: v/h high alt at 209:03."
roger. out.
"do they want it on or off? well, i don't think we've got quite that yet."
i didn't know if - because you will be down in here for this perilune. i don't think it's - -
okay.
ah -
"roger. we copy. and, falcon, the data looks good. we have the tm check."
"okay. sm/ac power is coming off, huh?"
"while we're on that, henry - while we're on that one, henry, i didn't see where we terminated 509. do we keep it running all this time?"
"okay, and they are just putting on the finishing touches on the flight plan change."
sure is.

"no, you're getting drowned out again."
trying to come down hill a little bit now. what's our velocity?
"there's the one on the sunny side. )5 12 03 44 cdr man, have z got the grapefruit rock of all grape- fruit rocks. it's got to come home in the space- craft_ it'll never fit in the rock box. okay, houston, i'll tell you what i'm going to do. i'm going to wind up at the right place at head crater; and, while i'm waiting for al, i_ll roll a boulder for you. okay, houston? i'm now looking at - - 0_' 12 04 09 _ sounds good, pete 0_ 12 0k 18 cdr - - that crater is - - 05 12 0_ 20 cc 0kam, houston. can you give us a mark when you roll over - - 35 _ ,0421 2dr yes, i sure will. that crater is, by golly, a rather steep crater - a lot steeper than it looks from out the lm. it's - confidential a"
"how you read me, dick? okay?"
that 's affirm.
"sure did. we copy noun 62, and your orbit by radaw is 95 by 90."
there you go.
"me, too. (laughter)"
"yeah, i got it. here you go, ken. too-do-do-do."
"go, aquarius."
"roger. you're about three-by now, buzz. we're satisfied with this comm configuration. let's stay with where we are. over."
"okay. repress, service module 02 supply, surge tank 02, three of them, to off."
next verify - -
what do you want?
"okay, houston. i collected one sample, which was a - a sharp angular."
okay.
"let me get back on *** cooling here to - to save some *** okay, now. iafp-eva okay - the bottom 10 centimeters - -"
"bob, i already got it and i'm in auto. just about 30 seconds ago."
"and - with your concurrence, i'll take the h2 fans all to auto now."
"okay. i'll put it in work right now, then come back and stand by to copy the rest of - well, i - not the rest - everything."
"rhc number 2, locked."
okay. understand.
"well, gordo. looks like i'll lose you right in the middle of this zodiacal light sequencer."
"well, let's forget about it."
off.
"roger. and that completes the procedures. maybe a couple of more words about it here. it's also possible that when you push the circuit breaker - to the pilot valve a in, that the light will just go out, in which case, we'd be pretty confident that - the contamination causing the short is just a burn through. in other words, just disappeared and is no longer shorting the switch. the light would go out, and otherwise, nothing else would happen."
maybe i can figure out some way to make it useful yet.
thrust - you're no go if the gtc is not decreased to 57 percent by p64 plus 15 seconds.
okay. we 'll take a look.
"okay, babe, your trim's to .2. forget the y."
...
72 and go.
"apollo 11, houston. go."
copy that. thank you.
... they got up a special menu; it has everything that you want on it. you can eat steak and eggs ...
what's your new logic?
"see him, john?"
"(laughter) okay, i'll put my old timer on."
"that's the way to play it, though."
"hey, jim."
okay. we'll just go with the 0.2 and see how that does.
"houston_ america. if you happen to have a summary report of eva-3, i'd sure like to hear it."
see that?
roger.
"oh, okay."
"(laughter) i'd like a more positive approach, charlie. john, you want to give me some of your - -"
"okay, houston, you got p00 and data."
"cabin gas return, egress?"
"falcon, houston."
"okay, here come the tsbs, you guys."
terminator photo stop.
as i look up wessex cleft from just about abeam of it - let me get over here - it still shows me an albedo change and a surface wrinkle-texture change.
"yes, i'll change it out when we stop."
the timer's - it - the mission timer stopped at 124: 47:37.
"okay. okay. yes, will do. yes."
"yes, it's open now. gosh, look at those trajectories (laughter)."
"okay, you had a momer,tary dropout when ?leu read those two figures."
"apollo 13, houston. were you trying to call?"
yes. gone. 04 23 37 50 ia{p-lm there you go.
how much stuff there is on this -
"that's all right. you - you can call us, but we - -"
"i just want to emphasize, bob, that these first 2 days - of course, yesterday was a pretty good day, but today we're catching up and - and, as i say, on the food consumption, don't be expecting too much."
...
"hey, tony. that thing's a piece - _kay, that thing's a piece of cake for aligning it at 270."
"that's the impression i get. they occur within a diameter to a diameter and a half of proclus, and - they're about the same brightness as the inner walls of proclus and they're small - just small craters. i don't see any - yes, i do see one which you might call a loop, which would suggest secondaries. they just seem to lie in the general direction of the rays of the ejecta from proclus."
0.7 at a crack.
get niybag. i'm taking some closeups. 5-94 · day 7 · __ i_mp-eva - - very fine phenocrysts. okay.
"... well, we should have some around here somewhere."
"no, we only - we only came about 25 yards ... i didn't notice, though."
"sounds like it would be fun, someday."
is that right?
"yes, they're nulled right now. 04 04 36 20 cml_ okay .... do we have some - some fuel point at which to cut off and switch over to the lm power?"
"traverse lay over terrain of extraordinary geologic diversity and yielded a far greater variety of information than ever obtained on any other lunar traverse. systematic descriptions and samples of four of the six main units of the area, massif, subfloor, the light mantle, and the dark mantle were obtained. in addition, detailed descriptions were given of a variety of craters, including exciting discoveries that the crater shorty, and descriptions of the lee-lincoln scarp and lineaments in the hilly terrain. the south massif is composed of two main varieties of breccia; blue-gray and tan-gray blocks of both varieties were abunssnt at station 2 up on nansen. i won't go into the geologic details on those breccias. but - they then found samples of the subfloor unit exposed as blocks in the ejecta around larger craters that had been partly buried by the dark mantle. stand by."
"4, 3, 2, 1 -"
okay. stand by.
try af_ 0mni again.
okay. copy that.
(laughter)
"and there's a little bit left - - 04 18 46 h9 cc you have about 3 minutes remaining on that maga- zine, claremont-california. 04 18 46 54 lm_ roger. we won't change it. okay, i'm going vo press on out for the tv pan, houston."
"and, gordo, how did the spacecraft look to you as we came around?"
"oh, very well. you is the boss."
"now i'll give you a demonstration here, joe. got the tv on this - pallet here."
okay.
"okay,"
"apollo 13, houston."
yes.
"first one 60 seconds, huh?"
roger.
"casper, we have the angles. you're clear to start."
"hank, according to that theory, it sounds like the hardest work i've done in this flight was lift-off."
"okay, going to ... deadband now, guys. we're 102.5 - shutdown velocity -"
"okay, houston; stand by 1."
"okay. 05 08 22 _l lmp-lm well, let me give it a try, tony. i always have an opinion. the rocks around the - beyond the alsep, on our drive out past spook and buster, all had this breccia appearance to them, with the primarily grayish matrix with a dark elast. at buster, though, there were some - some rocks that tape8_/6 were very shocked, i think. in fact, they just crumbled in my hand - the one i picked up. so, at least _at buster and flag - spook, the rocks appeared to be different in the main than they are right here. over."
"okay, ""plus 03440."""
okay.
"yeah. you know, they - they don't want anything in those things."
roger. we're - we're giving you one last - -
no problem.
copy that.
manifold is great. manifold is right on. get - go to jets.
"thank you, charlie and thank you for all the help."
"! see your flashing light out there, now."
i don't read you yet.
yes. easy does it.
yeah.
okay.
"okay; looks good. 04 12 09 52 iaip-lm gordy, there was a slight upward - gordy, there was au upward fluctuation in pressure in the manifold when we fired that. it's back to where it was prefiring. _-_"
"there's smymhii down there, i finally figured out where we are. right down underneath the win_ow. i can see it now. _4p gordy, as far as we can, we'll try to run you a little bit along the orbital track. -___ be panning the camera more or less westward. tsiol- vosky starting and tsiolkovsky is itself in the crater fermi, and moving on to the east, the next big pair of craters that we spent some time study- ing is hilbert, which is just south, is righ_ there, and just a little bit northwest of zhere is ?asteur."
"i think i can get everything off my shoes by banging, if you'll just get my arms. i didn't really fall in much today, except mrybe m_ left arm. but --"
"yes. start with the middle, and we'll pick up the rim, too. 163."
"copy. and if you fellows will give me a call in the middle of your eating there, when you've got time, we'll do some talking at you."
whew !
okay.
... off. 06 20 25 59 cml° 0kay_ the potable's open.
and the s-ivb maneuver is complete.
"want to try and knock a piece off, here?"
okay. got that.
i've got a little piece of glass in my pocket.
"okay, that's what i thought. it's a blocky crater."
"okay, ratchet handle pulled to full extension and then ratchet one stroke. gets it so it gets it off the thing."
"gosh, you're shaking the whole lm."
5-4. go.
okay.
"well, it'll stop some of it if it stays on. i_p-eva well, what i mean, it's not projecting outward at all. it's curling back under."
"now, these haemus mountains have the same color tones, and what have you, as the - that field from tacquet to - to menelaus."
"you know, i can't get down to you."
i think so.
"yes. you're in good shape. that doesn't have to level, huh?"
"keep your speed down because if you have to turn, it doesn't like it on a downhill slope."
"}louston, aquarius."
then we're ready for you guys to get back to the lm and dust it.
"go ahead, 15."
roger.
"okay, dps burn card."
big bag is deployed.
and we're just southwest of henry. on the rim.
...
should be looking - i'm looking right up your window. c_ weli_ i got to tram_slate through the - sideways a little bit here°
okay. seco right on time.
"i've got them both, but i just haven't gotten to them - -"
"yeah, jump flat-footed straight in the air, 300 - about 4 feet. wow! that ain't any fun, is it?"
you feel pretty good about those?
"okay, i got both of these."
roger; dave. we suggest you try first holding the bracket at the front in place while you push the plss aft and jiggle it.
- - there's a ...
pan camera to standby in 30 seconds.
"that's correct, jack. we just about have proce- dures in hand detail checklist-type procedures to send to you. in other words, a time line with reference to entry checklist and any changes in the entry checklist. so, if you have a few pages of scratch paper, why, i think we'll have that to you within an hour."
okay. we'll see what happens.
"roger, al. good readback. and we'd be interested in knowing the status of the ems check you ran 2 or 3 hours ago, if you have it."
"the surface patterns are still the same, bob. the main difference being that we're getting probably a gradual increase in block population, and the blocks seem to be of a different char- acter. they - they may be breecias."
no problem.
hey_ look here - .._ - -
"i've got all kinds of things for you, al, when r you - -"
"roger; we copied. and, dave, when you finish this, we'd like you to move back towards the rover."
"i got one more question. how large is the bright zone you were talking about, ron?"
m_rk.
okay. keep it moving.
"okay. it's that same old ... 04 1_ 14 54 c_ okay, fred. i can hear you now, say again, please."
"okay, stand by just 1. 03 03 02 01 imp okay, panel 11 configuration, top row: ac bus b, i want the s-band antenna, open _ ordeal, open; ac bus a, tape recorder, open. second row, under rcs syste_ a, i want main sov through quad 1 tca, all closed. commander's x-pointer under flight displays, open; coas, open; ordeal, open. third row: rendezvous radar standby heater, open; landing tbkdar heater, open. under stab/control: atuitude direct bre_ker, closed; ed: logic poweii a, open; 'i'_pe50/7 lighting: utility, open. under ecs: suit fan 1, closed; auto transfer, closed. under comm: vhf b transmitter, open; vhf a receiver, open. under pgns: signal strength display, open; imu operate, closed. bottom row, eps: cross tie bus, open; inverter l, closed."

okay.

"roger. i've already done that, charlie."
stand by; we're maneuvering.
"15, this is houston. the word here is to go ahead."
"okay, jim. we're ready now to yaw another 90 degrees to the right."
"what'd you do, break lock, dick?"
drifts? yes.
"well, i'm thinking that, if we get a - if we get a workaround, which right now, i'm fresh out of ideas. but they've given me clever ideas before. 04 05 44 bo l_ip yeah. let me say i didn't mean that ""you"" literally. 04 05 44 b4 cmp i understand. (laughter) you don't - well, i guess you do feel worse than i do, but not a lot."
yes. that's right. i'm not quite sure what that ... means beyond 5 minutes.
"well, the signal strength oscillates when the antenna is in the ... but now what's'happened is the antenna is apparently driven off some amount and it's just staying there."
"h2 tank 2 fans are on, now."
oh.
"roger, houston. this is falcon, ..."
"oh! gee, what'd i do? try to get rid of them?"
the battery.
"hey, houston. tell chuck stahl [?] that attitude for the eva was outstanding."
"- well, that's good, right there."
did you get?
"man, that's good stuff, isn't it?"
"we could probably save some time going back by not following the tracks, you know, because- -"

roger. roger.
"okay, out menu reporter is stealing a cup of coffee. he'll be with you in a second."
"we've got some data here for you, for - if you're planning on taking those red and blue filtered exposures across the landing site - if you want this information."
"i tell you, *** a little bit rough; there's a population of blocks, as jack said, and there is an awful lot of small craters."
"okay, i guess that means you're go for docking, stu."
roger.

"okay; very good. what we're going to do, jim, is to drop the up-link and see what happens. and just to clarify the communications glitch that we had, the ground _tation lost the power amplifier, and we lost up-link to you. there was apparently no loss of down-link. so what we want to do now is to - is to drop the up-link and see if it creates the same glitches that - as you got on the ac bus that time. in view of your circuit breaker being out, we donlt think there's a connection, but we'd just like ta have this final confirmation. and - -"

okay. _f

"okay. before i start into it step by step, let me just say that it's basically - the - the change is basically moving some of the items around in time, and there's not many changes in procedures involved. the one main thing is we're going to ask you to go into - into the lm a little early, i guess, earlier than you had planned. and we're going to also re- quest that you give us enough - you bring enough of the telemetry on line so we look at the - can look at the lm batteries. and there's no particular reason we want to do this today. nothing that we suspect is wrong, but rather, apparently, the sys- tems people are interested in a better granularity in data points that they're taking on these bat- teries. that's the reason for this particular addition. other than that, i think there's no - nothing at all very - very different about this flight plan update, other than a few minor changes. and i'll go ahead and start if you're ready."
"yes; go ahead, joe."
"apollo 17, houston. over, jack."

"affirmative. maybe that was feedthrough, but we were on - jack was on - vhf, called you back on vhf. must have been s-band feedthrough, though. but verified; we're antenna left and vhf simplex alfa."
"okay, i'll roll to 280. i'll do a - -"
"very good. and, al - yes, stand by. we still got a couple of minutes yet. what i'm going to do is have you retract the mapping camera with it still running and then turn it off. we're running a little test on it. and i'll call back for you in a couple of minutes."
"oh, oh. oh, gosh, no, joe. it slopes right on down here. the same slope. it's just a little inflection here. jim, you should of - here. get your afterpictures, too."

go ahead_ houston.

"and, next, page 36, on the left-hand side."
"which reminds me, i've got my own docking checklist. oo gl 22 05 cdr oh, you did?"
"jim, charlie has some procedures to read up for you here; i think you'll need your activiation checklist, if it's ha_ldy."
"- - and one course of action is to omit the mid- course and make a total midcourse, say, about 8 hours before entry. we haven't decided yet."
"okay. master alarm just came on. okay. and the heaters, mesa, open. you can open your mesa heaters. we're getting a master ai_, houston. i don't know why."
"deke, it's about 51, i think, or 50 in the lm, and itts about - i don't know - 45 or little bit less in the command module."
"isn't that something. america, you look beautiful."
"you see because there is so - so doggone many craters around here, i mean - -"
"okay. we need to get a - put one of those dikes in another bag. bob, it looks like some fraction of the blue-gray material has obviously - -"
"houston, 15. if you could stand by about 5 min- utes, why, our trusty cml°could fin - finish up his exercise period and get with you on that."
i'll tell you one thing ... out of here.
okay; the tanks look good now.
"america, how do you read challenger?"
"yes, sir. in earthshine i can see the whole lm, now."
okay.
okay.
"yes; yes, we did."
okay.
yes.
"okay, vance, i've got your readouts on page 3-13 of the flight plan."
roger. you're about 3 by; clear enough to understand.
"that's all right, jack. that won't come out. just put it in there."
...
"hey, we made a tactical error here. 05 13 32 49 i24p in what fashion?"
negative. no hurry; we have plenty of time here till los - 14 minutes. we want to see it before then. c_ oh s okay. i'll get it out before _hen.
okay.
"geno, can you see that over there? cdr_eva oh, yes. i can see it now between the gray and blue-gray?"

"hey, we_d be%ter, hadn't we. black and - d-caldera is what i called it. lmi° yes, ron's d-caldera - i'm just correlating apparent colors now, or hues. and, the lighter-colored material there is comparable in hue to the subfloor color at the landing site. smp the first one's f/32 at 1/500. tobias mayer. cml° ... a window."
how's your window doing?
okay.
i've got - i got a good pan over here. did you get the crater at all?
got it.
okay. just barely drifting in the coas. looks pretty good here.
"man, it's really tempting though. it really looks nice out there."
okay .... - -
huh?
you need to go to your left a little to clear the purse and your harness. there we go.
"11, houston, we ju_;tlost our pic - i see we're going back outside now. over. 01 10 3h 29 sc ..."
"okay, i rocked it. it's swinging."
"it's in bag 312, bob."
understand. thank you. that means you're going to let it go to the relief valve.
"go ahead, ?redo. 04 11 53 39 _wp okay. if z hear it, i'll sw_tch - -"
okay.
"pete, we copy that you finished the core tube. is that affirm?"
"okay. i copy that. probably just three samples then will be sufficient, then."
yes.
"houston, you going to want to cycle some film here?"
that's right.
... that attitude ...
no. you keep clipping out your first - your first number.
okay. no problem.

okay. i'll just step right back out to you in a flash.
"everything's routine. if you want a news report, we can dig one up, i think."
okay - -
i want to get my time hack at 88 hours.

"well, that's not bad."
okay.
all right.
"oh, it'll l_utus right in the middle of the corridor, ,lim."
"... 03 08 34 27 cml° okay. man, that's gonna ... a crick in my neck before this is over."
"how does that look to you, houston?"
"okay; 2 aft, john, now. 07 07 42 30 _ look at all that dust. okay. minus i0. 07 07 42 50 i2_p little bit more."
"you want me to guess, tony? i don't think so."
"delta-rim crater just as has been, i think, dis- cussed in the literature, has just that delta rim with no obvious ejecta blanket around it, com- pared to other larger craters within the basin. we're directly over that crater right now. it's filled with mare, very smooth mare. matter of fact, within that fill, i can see no - no craters. getting very close to the earth terminator, but you see good texture in the ejecta blanket of the large crater in the north part of the inner basin of orientale. the radial ridge and valley patterns are very clear; the concentric coarse hummocks near the rim are apparent; and you can even see the second - patterns of secondaries, the larger sec- ondaries, extending out away - radially out away from that crater. the south - the mare fill in j the south floor of copernicus, i mean of orientaie, is very smooth but does have the sea-swell texture that we saw over in tranquillitatis."
"houston, apollo 11. checklist page f9-7; i've completed step 8, and i'd like to know what y¢>u think is ideal timing between step 8, stet_9, and step 10 on that page? over."
"roger. loud and clear, fred."
"oh, yeah. 05 04 44 07 hmp-eva okay, bag number 10, tony, is another one."
"copy that. i_-eva say, bob, i need a quick f-stop for the 500."
"okay, mike. we had a request that yo_ disconnect. the yellow connector from the signal conditioner and verify that it looks okay, reconnect it and then, if you would, check the two electrodes that are placed one on each side of your lower rib cage. over. 07 10 58 36 c_ i bet you there's a smile on charlesw_rth's face."

okay. how about a range and bearing readout.
"roger, apollo 11. c_ ahead and try it again now that you're in attitude."
"okay. and, also, we'd like you to read out t ephem for us. that's verb 5 noun i 1706 enter."

"hello, houston. how do you read challenger on an omni right now?"
okay.
"15, houston. we'd like high gain, pitch at minus 30, yaw of 150."
"roger. 02 02 5_ 19 cc 16, how dc you read now?"
"jim, it's been a little warm in the machine through- out yesterday and last night during the ptc. it cooled off somewhat with the windows buttoned up, and we've seen suit temperatures of about - the high 40's and cabin temperatures in the low 60's. but this seems to be still a little bit on the warm side."
somebody kicked dirt all over the mesa. let's see if there is any life - in this here baby. 0h 19 03 04 cdr-eva okay. getting up and on.

"okay, dave, you called it right on from memory. that's exactly the score sheet we had. stand by a second. let me - let me read over this second question. okay - -"
can you give me the time bias so we can - i can do that? update the times on the page?
"there's no change down here, al. that's coming in there, now, al. okay, what change did you make?"
thank you for the picture. it's the next best thing to being up there.
wrong switch.
(laughter )
"no problem, jack; no problem. ob 17 28 52 cmp okay, houston. there are the torquing angles."
"ed was right, it does wind up on itself."
"roger, houston. apollo 11 calling in from about 130 000 miles out. and we'll zoom our camera in slowly and get the most magnification we can. over. o1 10 00 d6 cc roger."
"man, this suit is too tight."
i'm real sure.
"yes, let's head that way with the rover when we get going."
"roger. ob 12 08 56 cdr gordy, unless i get proven wrong here, i think we'll be able to watch it all the way in as long as we can keep shadowed from the sun."
"okay, that's _;oobig; stick that in the etb, also. go ahead, houston. those are the ... rocks - - age t cidn t! , ;ay"
"what did we deserve to do - do to deserve being out here, huh?"
"go ahead, ron. cm_° i didn't have my map there, but i was looking at the landing site, and as close as i can remember, it had to be somewhere around about dn 83.3 on the 200-meter scale, the tl25-8."
"11, houston. we see the - still see the banding along the intratropical convergence. i guess the most predominate one now is around the - up in the - around the equator or slightly north of the equator."
"roger, joe. understand tei-64, sps/g&n; 36310; plus 0.61, plus 0.92; 204:08:11.62; plus boll.o, minus 0019.6, plus 0048.8; 180, 102, 002. the rest is na. four jet, 12 seconds."
roger. you've got it.
"man, tony, this is a real - this ray pattern extends back about 200 meters or maybe more to the east and goes as far as we can see off to the - west, which is maybe another 200 meters. i can see smoky mountain now, and i can see dome. kenesol(?) is plainly visible with a big - two big craters on its flanks. and if you look toward smoky, i see some big craters up on the top, but i can't see ravine or any - or north ray yet."
"try that. b ... a. okay. how do you read me, jack."
sure hope this thing comes up. and there it is.
"okay. logic power number 1 is going to jett, number 2 to jett. standing by for your go, houston."

"well, they sure are dirty. okay, ron, i - in the flight plan at 133:12, way on ahead, you just might mark this down somewhere. it's a real simple - ""mapping camera/laseraltimeter cover, open,"" and ""mapping camera, extend,"" you'll just delete those since they're already there."

"the readback is correct and the next - next change is at 219:07; and once again delete the ""pcm cable"" line. and at 219:17 add, ""laser altimeter, off; close map camera and laser experiment covers."" and delete map camera extension. and the last addi- tion, that is to say the last change, is at 220 plus 05, delete the ""pcm cable"" line. over."

"roger; want us to - delete the logic power, two, if we're going to do the mass spec at 275?"
"okay. let us go through them, joe, as we pick them up, because we can't tell any difference as they sit on the surface. they're all covered with dust. and, the first one here is a fine-grained breccia - a microbreccia. and, it's got - it looks like a third order with white clasts in it. the matrix is dark black, and it has glass within a fracture on the side. not unlike some of the 14's."

"hello, houston_ challenger."
how are you doing in there?
"okay. it - it's dusted. going downhill, it doesn't get near as much dust as it did coming up - for some reason."
"17, houston; go ahead."
"okay. and while you' re doing that, remember, i want inventories of the stuff as it comes off the rover and where you put it over there by the foot- pad, so we can help you keep track of it."
"okay, there's our 30 seconds."
"and, jim, on your pan, were you able to sweep around the full b60 degrees?"
"i haven't quite learned how to pick up rocks in my hands yet, bob, or i would of had you a sample. that's why i fell down. my day will come (singing). oh, oh! it's an old blue traverse gravimeter."

what's that?
let us finish this.

"okay. scu open. verify flow and purge umbilical. and then the panel 603, eva station 02 off - 02 off."

"al, the equipment bays were white on the side, and the scoop itself was a light blue."
they are light-colored clods.

now we just take the csm and strip it down. start putting the ... stuff in here.

"go ahead, joe."
yes.
"there, it's coming up."
okay. it's pretty good. why don't you stand there?
"okay,"
"hey, this is a great place to keep this map. right - wedge it in that camera. yow hoo! man, that was a great - big skid. we're doing 10 clicks, tony."
"yeah. okay, she's shut down."
"yes. you guys had a beautiful launch, there. really nice."

very good.
okay; that sounds pretty good. thank you. f
no.
"okay. at 149:05 on the next page, your solar corona pad."
should come off pretty easy.
go ahead.
"okay, copy."
"well said, dave - -"
the plss seems to have shifted.
"what we're doing it, making a mess. you'd be better off - let me - listen, can you - you - leave - leave it sit. let me hold that. you - you put that stool back here closer."
okay; i'll do that. the challenger looks as good as ever. no problems at all through the night.
sure sounds like it.
okay.
*** but it wants to slide out. it's full. no rocks in it. it looks like just the same stuff we've been traveling through.
"yes. i was looking at it through the binocs last time, and z couldn't really see anything that was really defined as coming on through there."
"okay, it's back to auto."
fuel cell react valves are normal. i'm sort of glad we had those in latch.

"ken, eecom says that the present setving should kee_: you in good shape."
okay.
"okay. real fine, bob. bob, i'm not sure whether it's entirely proper, being a bachelor, but i'd like to send my regards to everybody - all the families listening to squawk boxes tonight."
"so you can go to attitude hold there, jim."
i'll go behind that rock; that looks good from here.
i think the circumference of that crater right there ceases to be round - -
mark.
"look at that overhang. man, i tell you, if you can get your shovel down there, you'd have a ball. l_p-eya yes, let's sample in the split first *** we don't get it too messed up. and then we can sample some of this stuff, iiot - we want this overhang over here, geno - the north faci_!g one. ce)r-eva right here? [2_-eva yes. i got to get - sneak by over there. whoops! don't shuffle too much dirt in there."
roger. that's verified. it's open.
"quick update on the crew status report. the well- being of the crew is very satisfactory, capable of c_rying out everything that is required today. and_ specifically, the health of the crew is excel_lent."
"rate, high."
"okay, houston. we've got the checklist out, and we're ready to listen."
houston. roger. out. 04 13 35 43 l_i_ okay. the handle is off the *** in aho_t 6 or 8 inches into the surface. i could *** easy ***
okay.
"11, this is houston. we're targeting - planning to make the loi-2 burn now using bank a only. we'll have the p;_dand everything for you next time around. just trying to economi _e a little on bank b. bank b is holding, thoug,_."
"okay. let me get - make sure i got this item. i want a, simplex. hell, it was already there. b to off. no, it wasn't. it's just a hard switch again. they really fake you out, these switches - - ©0 00 25 18 cmp yes. i've noticed - - 00 00 25 19 _lp - - they move so hard. o0 00 25 20 c_ i've noticed that, fred. o0 00 2_ 21 _ compared with the simulator. okay, let me check item 13 off; i've completed that one. let's see. 00 00 2!;30 cmf yes. i've got - -"
go.
"okay; that sounds good to us. yes, dave; the point's being made that it can be even longer than that, if you really feel like you need it."
"okay. yes, i see b is up high. is that due to the thruster activity?"
"jack, this is houston."
"and, aquarius, for your information, we now have 136-mile perigee. confirmed by doppler."
"that's true, joe. that's true."
son of a gun! sorry about that. okay ....
"okay, 156:22 - which is coming up here - like to, at that time, verify all command module vhf off. you are now ll after - you have to terminate the jet-on monitor and then get the sounder operating. i can break this off at any time if you think we're pressing that. just interrupt me. at 156:50, lunar sounder pad. t-start is 156:51:05, and t-spot is 156:56:09. over."
go ahead.
it's slack.
"that's real great. i'm sure those words will be appreciated up at goddard, and around the world, of collrse ."
"okay, fred. good show. step 6: verb 41 noun 72 enter, plus all balls, plus 28300. step 7: monitor movement with verb 16 noun 72. step 8: cb ll rendezvous radar 2, open. are you with me ? over. 03 o0 48 13 i_p stand by 1."
"okay, dave. what - what we're going to try to do now is to go - go ahead and do an sps burn using bank a. and we want that short to be active when we do it. so at some point, we're going to ask you to tap on the panel and try to get the short back for us. we - we show that the light is currently out, and i'm sure you'll confirm that."
and did everything come through on the trim?
what?
"roger, al. put on our sunday best for you."
"yes. okay, we've got it on the spot here."
it really is a story to behold.
come further left. that's a pretty good sized one.
okay ....
isn't that fantastic!
"flag p; press flag, 0; 02 .... and tones."
"i think it's very apropo at the moment. i guess i can just wait for ""hail purdue,"" huh?"
all got covers.
"let's see, i out - let's see, checkpoint i is - you said 1.7."
- - got too much sun in my eyes.
i put this antenna up 1 foot too close.
"everything looks pretty good down in the s-ivb, too. the shroud still looks intact down there."
"roger. and down at the fifth item, where it says ""load dap,"" delete that."
yes. i figure this is probably the best one of all.
... enter - -
just to stir you up a little bit.
"say, i think i've hit bedrock. i think i've hit the bedrock! okay, dave, here you are."
"and, jack, is that your last lrv sample bag?"
"okay. 03 ih 18 50 lmp a:_ewe maneuvering? we completed everything? 03 14 18 53 cl,di _'_o,we haven't half completed. we've gov a hell of a long way to go. 03 ih 18 58 cdr ... the bailout attitude. 03 ih 19 00 lmp yes."
"and, houston; 15. as we leave and look back, why, i guess we still have the impression the moon is mostly gray. however, when you're up-sun, as we were just prior to tei- when you're looking up-sun, it does definitely take on a chocolate-brown color. _-_ we came around prior to tpi on the dayside - or tei on the dayside, looking backwards into the sun across schroter's valley, and that was a pretty spectacular sight. and it did start turning a chocolate brown, but now everything is a variation of gray, from very light to a gun-metal gray near the terminator."
"... here. yeah, yeah, yeah .... , yeah ...."
some of this cool air in here and it'll be okay.
"we're getting down to the nubs, boy (laughter). 10 04 15 34 _ i know it. that's good."
roger.
"well, i think we can get - i think right ---"
no.
"roger, ll. this is houston. at approximately 71 hours to 72 hours, we have you down for an eat period which i imagine is probably in prog- ress ,1ready. 71 hours: 02 fuel cell purge; 72 hours get: c02 filter change number 6, secondary radiator flow check. and we'll send you up a p37 block data on a 2 hour pass, pericynthion pass, return mode abort. at 73 hours 00 minutes: stop ptc at approximately 0 degrees roll. that is, when you're ccming up on 0 degrees roll angle around 73 hours, we'd like you to stop ptc. and perform a p52 option 3 remaining in the ptc refsmmat for a drift check. 73 hours, 20 minutes: we'll give you a p27 update to the landing site refsmmat, loi-1 state vector, and target load. 73 hours 30 minutes: maneuver to 000 roll, pitch, and yaw; high gain antenna angles will be pitch 0, yaw 335; and perform a p52 option i using the new landing site refsmmat. resume the nominal flight plan at 74 hours get. over. 02 23 09 08 _ okay. we'll get started on the fuel cell purge while we're eating. c02 canister change number 6; secondary radiator flow check; copy some pads. also at 72 hours, stop ptc 0 roll at 73; do a p52 option 3; we'll get your uplink refsmmat for the landing site; and at 000 - let's see, now was this with the old refsmmat or the new refs_s{at?

"there's a flat place right in here, charlie. 05 04 54 07 l_p-eva yeah, that's what i was thinking. see, you could go out up that way and then out over that way towards the lm. okay?"
roger. we copy.

you've got a crater right in front of you.
"okay, fred. understand only the lmp's red hose is actually plugged into the canister bag. in that case, we would like you to follow the pro- cedure for inserting the other red hose in the other canister bag as follows: you cut a diag- onal hole in one corner of'the bag. look at the o±her bag and see how it was done. stick the hose in about 6 _nches. try to get the outlet nozzle down if you can, or else sideways, and then just tape up the hose to the bag to make a nice tight seal. over."
"hank, before i throw out the electrophoresis, i'd like to verify that's still the intention."
that's affirmative.
"one, two, looks like the water - yeah, it's water."
"and, dave and jim- -"
*** good.
"yes. we're it for now. 04 10 38 32 cdr-i_ okay, mine's off on the peg on the cuff gage."

roger. *** fuel cell purge ...
that's affirmative.
okay.
"he sure must be a longs ways off, because even now he's not very big. you can see his moon, though. that's about all you can tell from it - tell who he is."
they didn't want me to do that .... the backside.

"okay. got it, charlie."
"okay, i guess we'd like you to do the p52 first."
look at this thing. that looks like the same kind of rock except it doesn't have any vesicles.
stand by.
stand by 1.
okay.
"and we hope you're going to get lots of rest here tonight. you've got plenty of time to do it, and, of course, with only two meals a day, why, you ought to be hungry enough to push the heck out of that. but as long as you're feeling good, why, everybody will be real happy down here, and you go as far as you feel like going. 05 08 58 4_ cdr-lm that's what we're doing. 05 08 58 h6 mcc roger."
"well, let me see if i can do something else while i'm waiting."
"amd 16, there's an advisory - when you do ia - going to the p52. you'll probably get a l01 alarm, which means that you've exceeded 60 degrees middle gimbal angle. you can go on with it, _ay."

"well, i haven't had a chance to use it yet, but i might tonight."
okay. there's a couple of things that we couldn't stow _s per nominal. they are the fecal bag and the goodie bag. and we intend to tie those down in the leb. the goodie bag is the in data file.
"guess what isn't opening again. should, though. it's all set right."
"dave, this is houston again. while we're talking, could you look back in your time line for us, please, and give us the results of your _s test. i guess that's a bias reading at around 27 hours."

"morning, alfredo."
aim it back at the lm. do you see anything at all?
"okay, steam pressure's pegged."

"okay, joe. point up, i'll - okay."
... on the angle ... a good shape.
"ail right, will."
"16, houston. i've got the figures on this burn that you wanted, and i guess i can start out by talking about the meter biases to make sure that we're clear on that. there's a 15-psi bias on the oxygen tank pressure. it's reading high. on top of that, there is a meter bias of 8 psi, which is also high, so that our total bias on the oxygen onboard pres- sure reading is about 23 psi high - oxidizer, i'm sorry. and, on the fuel, it's 7 low, total, which is a meter bias."
"golly, dave. .f"
"and, 17, we'd like the sep blankets opened and dusted one more time."

"okay, fine. boy, this tv sure makes it fun."
go ahead.
"okay, houston. i've been in tunnel vent now for about 11 minutes after 3.5 on the delta-p, and i'm going tunnel vent valve to off."
- - 1. okay. how about 41:307
"roger. and one final item on 274:05, in the mass spectrometer instructions there, the dis- criminator should be low instead of high."
"okay, 369."
"we - we have just one question, the lm tunnel vent valve. we're questioning why we're venting until the delta-v is greater than 1.7 if we are going to open up the tunnel, then pressurize the lm usually."
okay.
"okay. let me cross-check that here and see if we can get anymore words on that. let me give you one other suggestion and that's for securing the high gain antenna cable on the rover. we'd like to suggest that you get the roll of tape out, strip off about 1 foot, and fold a 1- to 2-inch tab on one end of it and wrap that piece of tape around the cdr camera so that after you get down on - to the rover you can use it to secure the high gain anten - cable to the high gain antenna mast and keep it from flopping around. over."
"engine gimbal, enable; that's over on my side - -"
likewise; and i'm - -
do you really know what ...?
"and logic power 2 to deploy/retract. 09 04 49 16 _ okay, stand by on those two."
"mark it; it's extend. yes, it was stuck right in there. 0op, okay, that's 2 - 23 seconds before it went to off."
"ooh, don't bang it. (laughter) i don't care what they say, that's a charge."
"oh, roger. mapping camera photo pad. start, 145:14:16, stop, 146:13:56. 05 23 58 46 c_p understand t-start, 145:14:16; t-stop, 146:13:56."

"okay. 06 04 04 h9 cmp but i'll have to take another look. you know, i could have been - i could have got caught with a crater that inverted on me too. i am going tc have to look carefully to make sure i didn't do that."
"okay, we'll just plan on it, ron."
okay.
"okay, houston. hey, that's mighty fine. apollo 17 air-to-ground voice transcription"
"yes, sir."
"roger that, jim. _on_,yauc_, (revl)"
i don't know why - it was hard to put on. surprised it came off. here let me - let me hold the end.
"16, houston."
worried about that.
that's affirm.
"and, ken, i got one more thing for you, a tei pad, a block data. 06 06 23 51 c_ okay. stand by while i get my other book. 06 06 24 24 c_ okay. i'm ready to copy."
copy.
"okay. we copy that, ron. the sounder still looks good, perking right away. and the mapping camera funny i mentioned earlier - we haven't nailed down exactly what it is. most likely, we think it's just an instrumentation erroneous indication. and so, we're going to continue with the normal schedule of activities on the mapping camera, except, of course, for the deploy and retraction."
okay. okay. that's what we'll do. 10 08 53 31 _ how did i get so tangled up here?
roger. 06 21 _6 50 lm2p-eva okay. magazine mike. 06 21 _6 53 cdr-eva okay. the battery covers are closed tight.
it's just a beautiful little valley.
"okay. i was looking at - aitken when they came that side. aitken is almost right in the terminator, right now. so when they come up on terminator photos there - the only thing is that, even though it was down in the shadow, down in the bottom of the cra- ter, i could still see the bottom of the craters on - when they come around there for the near- terminator photography. i'm going to open the camera up and take a picture down in the shadow itself and see if that works."
"dave, can you hold up until we clear up the corem, please _."
"yes. i'm getting a fair amount - getting a fair amount of rcs firing; more than i think i should. but how's the gimbal look to you guys, houston?"
"no. we don't want you to do that. read me your ?dai angles, and let's compare them with what we have down here. pa_,e 7]5 05 [7 09 55 cdr okay. you're looking at them in the dsky. i've got roll c_f8.)47; pitch of about 0.51; and yaw looking at about b.750."
"thank you. and we've got about ten minutes until los at the present time. when you've got a pencil and a paper, i'll give you a short flight plan update and a camera pad."
i guess we haven't been able to determine yet.
roger. understand.
...
the whole thing's getting hot.
"eagle, houston. when you get a chance, are your lcg's hooked up? and if so, what does the lcg accumulator show?"
"yes, i didn't have a chance to mention that. ### regolith is very thick, and i think you've got rocks below it."
land us right on the sh - the ship.
yes.
"round glass ball they got to have, al. quarter of an inch."
"okay, jack. i'm going to read it to you, and then add some comments and we'll talk about it a little. this should occur sometime after 49:30. after the p52 realine at 49 hours, if time permits we would like the crew to investi- gate while in ptc if there is a roll angle in which the comet can be observed for photos. if there is, record the optimum roll angle for possible photography, prior to reinitiating ptc at 56:30 or so, whenever the guys are done in the lm, use p52 planet option, and the following half-unit vectors for tracking comet bennett at about 49:46. are you ready to copy half-unit vectors? over."
"houston, endeavour."
how about a little lcg pump action?
"okay, i'll turn the switch on."
you deserved it. a hs_er thrower - you're a geologist. you ought to be able to throw it.
stand by.
"oh. he never did make it on, so he taped it on. and we don't know whether it's light struck or not, and we don't know why lt popped open. but, we're surely suspicious. we also don't know if it was only partially on to begin with, or that we really did lose film. so i think it's best that we take a fresh magazine which we have, and we'll get those pictures again."
yeah.
"well, i can't turn it."
"and then you get the aot clamps off the utility lights and open the clamp jaws to max. and you stow the clamps, and you roll up the paper - roll up the - roll up your fender shortwise and put a gray tab over that and stow it in the etb. you got both the clamps and the paper fender in the etb. and then when you get out to the rover, you lay the edge of your fender over the inboard guide rail and clamp it, and then you lay the other edge of the sheet over the outboard rail and clamp it. and the only thing you're - really have to worry about is making sure that the inboard clamp is right over the shock strut so that you don't get any interference with the lrv structure when you turn the wheel."
okay. let's get a verb 80 going. okay. a_ call 34. 05 22 02 0[ lmp 34. okay. we can set the ~ counting down ta tpi.

okay.
i understand you'd like to repeat?

okay. that's not a bad plan.
okay.
okay. there you go.
i'll get it for you.
"okay. i'm glad you said that because i don't see any indication of it moving here yet, at all."
"yes. we're still wearing them, bob. and, i swore i'd take them off after the drill, but i used a bit of real-time common sense."
ags set at ... there it is.
"okay, i guess we'll try and probably work that in some other time, now that we've got the antennas out. and, we'd like to go high gain antenna to auto and 2-1/2-degree deadband now that we're not doing the lunar sounder."
"okay. battery 1, hi vclt, off/reset."
"al, would you turn the laser altimeter, on? laser altimeter, on."
"hey, they're good. they're a little different. they're more the gabbro type. yes - wait a second. wait a second."

how about right where you ... yes.

"when you did your p76, dick, with my burn in it, did you get any noun 49's afterwards, or did it come right up with a good state vector?"
"well, you take some pictures, and i'll meet you over at that big mound. ail right?"
"well, i'm sneaking inside of the i2_[where he doesn't have ... incidentally, this ptc must have some - must have a wobble mode around our x-axis there because now the moon and earth are back in the right perspective."
"at 5:01:20, we'll be starting a lox dump through the s-ivb engine. and we have the refsmmat when you're ready for it - for the p52."
i don't know.
"and, ed, an e-memory dump coming down."
"okay, got it."

"okay, go ahead."

"... we've been noticing that, i think, for about 24 hours or so. i just - hadn't put it together as maybe being the s-ivb. i thought it was just some other particle out there."
"okay, orion. i understand you're coming up on the hot fire check, and i think i'm supposed to go to a wide dead band. can i have about 2 minutes to complete my suit check?"
take a picture of that?
"13, houston. we'd like you to verify couple of readings for us. we would like the nitrogen pressure on fuel cell 1. we need the oxygen pressure on fuel cell 2."

"at 191:16, you'll have to use an arrow again - -"
"they're not coming off as fast as they were awhile back, but maybe that's our sun angle has changed, making them not quite as obvious."
copy that.
"yes, john. i - i - i think we ought to try some- thing because you told me, but i - i guess you can't appreciate it until you see it happen your- self. that - that dust without that - that fender is just almost unacceptable. it - this sounds pretty good. how do you want those things taped together?"
yes.
"okay, and we're off to ... the alsep ...."
"*** it, charlie?"
"11, houston. on the rcs, what we are saying is that if we lose control about one axis prior to low gate, we would recommend an abort. this would require a - a loss of - of two distinct jets which is not very probable, but that is what we are recommending. after low gate we would continue on. we would recommend that we continue on to attempt a landing. over.

"okay, jack. what you're reading now the angles? we had the moon centered, and it's pretty close to what we have on the 8 ball, i guess. close enough for any entry that we'd like to do."

"well, i'll start out and - and throw an answer there. i think if you look back at the original requirements for the landing at the hadley- apennines, they were primarily to inspect the front and the rille. it was only after a - a consider- able amount of study had been done and some re- arrangement in the flight plan - the timing on the surface, that we found we had enough time to plan to go to the northern complex. so the northern complex was, in fact, an addition to the original requirement; it was bonus. and i think because jim and i have spent so much time with volcanics in our terrestrial geology work, that we were quite interested in getting to the northern complex to see if, in fact, it was a volcanic area. but i don't believe we lost anything from the lunar sur- face by not going there; only we would have had an /_' extra bonus had we been able to reach that point. and, with that in mind, i hope that some day some- body gets a chance to go back and take a look at the northern complex. jim, do you want to answer?"

"and, houston marks one minute, and you have got good pumps."
and we're doing l0 clicks.
"(laughter) if you'r e talking about the flight plan, yes."
go ahead.
"and, jack, we're making plans here to change the camera usage at the end of eva here. and we're going to let you take commander's camera out to the alsep and take a few photos that people think we need. and gene's going to take your camera out and document the geophone when he deploys it. we will not deploy it for the long-term experiment, however. and we'll bring both back and carry them to the etb when we get done."
roger; understand.
"okay, my pan - out of the way real quick. 06 04 02 56 i_mp-eva joe, do you only - only want it 12 inches deep?"
"and that's our plan, ken. is there any question on that?"
"i'll do it, dave. okay. the heading - is 270; and the bearing, 0.17."
...
"16, houston. we're going to have to delay going into the ptc until after we close the waste stowage vent valve at 13:50. 00 12 53 41 lmi° okay. we're supposed to wait 20 minutes for the rates to damp anyhow, huh?"
who's giving the big sighs? you guys are huffing and puffing like it's on - -
"oh, boy."
"say, gordo, gordo, gordo. hey, gordo - -"
nobody likes a pessimist.
"hey, jim."
- - changes at all.
...
yeah.
"go ahead, america."
"i guess i'd have to say - sort of, two events oc- curred which were exciting for different reasons, and i guess they were really kind of the highlights of - of the flight for me. one was right after loi, when we got our first look at the moon, and it was a fantastic, spectacular sight. and the other, i guess, was when tei burned so beautifully, and right after tei, that was an awfully good feeling. ll 06 25 ll _ okay. well, i guess there were a great many new thrills for me, and the one that was most impres- sive, though, was the lift-off. it began the flight, and i knew that i was going into space after a - a few years of waiting and training. and then, as far as the event that i would not like to - to repeat again, was probably the - the time when i fell down in front of the tv when we were deploying the rover."
i'll use those.
"roger. you're in po0 and accept, no midcourse 3, and we're all set for a state vector update and i'm giving you the lm/cm delta-p here shortly."
"well, we'll give it to them anyway. 352 for .7."
"yes. that was appropriate, i guess."
"well, jack_ we'll just take that chance."
"jim, you want us to bring ascent bats on or wait until about 35 minutes?"
"just do the best you can on that, jim. no problem."
"maybe ycur vox is too high, al."
"i think we can get some over here. if you're - if you're careful coming over here, we can get glass that looks like it may have crystallized in place there."
"let us get depr - pressurized first, karl."
okay. okay. go to secondary.
"okay, i understand. you can talk to each other in a, b, and ar in the lm. the last word that i had from you - was when you reported 92 percent oxygen; and i believe, at that time, you were in mode a."
"hank, there's one other thing i'd like to comment on before i forget it."
"roger, jack. 54:58:50. thank you."
"okay. i'd just - you know, i'd feel bad ... tli."
"okay. crew status, no medication everything seems to be fine. prd is 23163."
"okay, i'm closing - -"
"okay, why don't you take a soil right there - - 06 01 38 34 imp-eva and there looks like - -"
"okay. _d on the suit gas diverter, to cabin. 04 09 57 h5 cdr-lm okay_ it's push - cabin."
400 plus i is in.
... one of those cycle slips of that radar.
what's that?
okay.
... black and white ...
good drogue.
"okay. ail right, in, all the way over to tit, which is out. 05 21 33 45 iimp okay. 05 21 33 _6 cdr one, in; one, out. 05 21 33 29 lip right."
okay. i'll give you a mark - -
let me get up there slowly. i'll put them on this low saddle here. 045 will give them a good heading.
who's going to ...?
"okay, tony. there are not any house-size rocks, but the biggest ones are maybe 5 meters. and it's really smooth except for the these big rocks out - out here. it's smooth going."
roger. it will be bearing of 100 and range of 4.6.
did you throw something out of there?
"and - yeah, it does keep on coming down here. 08 08 39 17 ijfp yeah. 08 08 39 18 cml° you can take a strip starting at the top of it and then come all the way to the bottom."
roger.
...
yes. 10 08 lh 13 lmp yes.
"yes, you did great, gene."
"okay, i'll -"
"roger. 07 22'50 40 cc and mike, if you're oa loop there, to extend the range and the constant g reentry, here, i've got a little procedure, if you would like to listen to it."
don't let me - i'm not -
affirm.
okay. purge valve is in. and you're vertical.
"yes, i think the meter's been tapped since we've been working on the rover. yes - 100 and 120."
that's about all i've got to do.
"yes, sir. 05 13 53 09 c_ po0 and accept. you got it."
"about 35 seconds. have 30. ems, normal."
"apollo 11, houston. would you give us po0 and accept? we have a load for you. over."
12 o'clock.
"this big boulder right here, al,,which stands out bigger than anything else - ought to be - ought to be able to see it."
"okay. the star c?,eck al the entry attitude, is it a sextant star check or a coas star check?"
thank you.
yes.
that's affirmative. the white material in the fastest tute.
okay ....
huh?
"ready when you are. and, troops, are you raiding the pantry up there yet? lnp-lm yes, we are. we've been hitting it as hard as we can. okay, power amp is going to prin_4_ryand pcm to high. and, while we're waiting for gene to look at this computer, shall i do the battery _a_agement ?"
it's just a dummy plug.
yeah. it was a good update.
"okay, we're heading down into another depression. it has oh, one, two, three - three other recent craters. the one of the - the southern rim looks to be the most recent. in fact, it's kind of a doublet with a smaller crater in - in the north rim of it."
"and then at keyhole, you look .,. and the bright one, you look to the left. 03 l0 5h 59 cdr you know, i think this is ... down here. look at ... - -"
"america, houston. how's the mapping camera talk- back look?"
"hello, houston; america."
"if we take this picture it'll be famous forever; even better than when we grab the surveyor by all of its parts, dismantling it handily."
"okay, i'll disregard. apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription r 02 14 14 34 cdr houston, apollo 15."
roger.
roger.
"okay. yes, that's fine. how's that?"
either one. over.
that's affirmative. he's just about directly overhead. we kind of suspect he's off the headset since he is maintaining radio silence this pass for the bistatie.
no. i'll just take it to it. let me know when you're ready for a bag.
okay.
"apollo ll, houston. fido's are looking at the data. it's too early to tell yet exactly. it's looking real good so far. we'll have you some answers shortly on trajectory. over."
"okay. start with s_ar 22 for the first one, if ysu've got a chance to write it - - o0 o0 34 29 i2_ okay. star 22."
"did we hit the stick, or something? huh? looks like we're changing attitude. well, i'll be darned. i put oscar oscar on there and i got but one pic- ture. (laughter) and it's empty. well, that's probably right. those won't come out too good there, anyhow. too close to the terminator for this kind of film."
okay. stand by 1.
okay. we've got that one. what kind of a att hold mode do you want us to do? do you want us to do wide deadband? i didn't ... on the dap.
"very interesting. we are just about to switch omnis. 02 15 42 15 iaip houston, 17."
csm.
"at 196:47, laser altimeter, on; image motion, on; mapping camera, on; t-start; image motion, increase, barber pole plus 1. and your t-start is 196:49:43."
"i already did, and it's running. it'll be running."
"right. there's a ... you better jump. no, no, that's not noun 81."
"rate scale, 25."
okay.
"that's correct. it's still in the up and on posi- tion, and when i went to the on position, up, the light went out. i'll just leave it there while you think about it."
"okay, houston, we'll sep at 4:18."
"roger. stand by a minute, jim. our signal strength is getting a little iow. we may have a recommendation."
"yes, it's something we don't - we don't - sim fmcs, tlcs, and tecs very often. that's for sure."
"roger. okay, and that's all the update we have for you at the moment. you might be interested in knowing that that water dump you guys scheduled last nighs before you went to bed, was at a very opportune time. your ptc drifted plus or minus 2 and a half degrees all night."
okay. i copy that.
do we have another eat period before tv?
that's affirmative.
bet you those prunes are going to lay in my stomach like a rock.
"okay, houston. you want to do the lcru switch to mode 1 and - or what do you want to do? and - -"
tied it too tight.
"... 24:20, ron."
"okay, houston; 15. stand by 1,"
"okay, thank you, joe. give us a call after your minute."
"you're loud and clear, jack. it looks good here."
"well_ we can do it down there, too."
"yeah. that sure is a fascinating place down there. ... good-size chicken, though."
i think i heard that. let me read it back: 171:37:22.36. and i have some star changes for the ps?.
"i don't have any idea, charlie. sure hope so, be- cause there ain't much other place to put it. if it ain't next to the rock, it's going to be in that hole right next to it."
okay. mission timer; let me doublecheck.
outstanding.
"okay, real fine. okay, i'm going to maneuver to 060, 090, and 0. _ 02 07 50 31 cc and, 13, we'd like you to check c-4 thruster. ""_ '_ 02 07 51 33 cmp okay, jack. the battery charge has been ter-"
"and - and it looks like a - almost like a cowpie - pile-type of bomb, *** if you'll pardon the expression. it's not flattened. it's - it's - it's - -"
"i think if we cleaned it out and all, it probably would made a big difference, but - 07 22 ll 14 imp i - that'll be my project for the - for after the eva."
"fantastic stabilization, al; it's going to turn ove r."
okay. that's correct.
okay. copy that.
you'll have to pull the bottom - -
"lind at - back up at 152:41, out to the side there, you can write it - add ""po0, discontinue bistatic radar. vhf range, off; vhf a and b, off."" and then ""return your s-band mode ranging to ranging."""
"well, so does that big one - -"
"no, i'm facing the other way."
"okay, i'm going to get a couple of samples from the rim here - on the surface. oops, the first one i tried to pick up, just fell apart. get a couple pieces of it. won't be able to look at it for you, but i'll bring it home. it's a clod - it's just a caked clod. and it's in 273."
you got to have a recovery mode.
"houston, apollo 11. we've terminated direct 02, our cabin pressure is 57, and, as a matter of curiosity, when we turn the direct 02 valve off, we get a master alarm just like they did ia the spacecraft testing."
slew.
"16, houston. would you take the logics, off, please, and then back on again?"
is that the best you could do?
"well, vance, i've been trying to use minimum impulse only attitude control to get my roll and yaw - the roll and pitch, rather. but, with the attitude control orzlyin this configuration, i - i can't command these - the roll the way i want to. so, i had to go to ttca to get my roll to build up towards zeio, it was goin_ - decreasing towards 270. i really don't know what the combina- tion is in the attitude control, that you can get the control to pitch ard roll the way you want it to. you've got to use the ttca."
"if you put it on right, you're going to disappoint me."
did you read our noun 817
roger.
"well, look at that, would you. 05 06 09 35 i24p-lm boy, mine are tired, too. i'll tell you."
"okay, go - we're free."
"okay. when you say go on the residuals, you mean don't trim them. is that right?"
okay.
and i'm standing by to go to p47 just as soon as you give me a go for pyro arm.
"i'll tell you, the old landing site stands out now. you couldn't miss that for anything. and it wasn't that obvious at the lower sun. unfortunately, i'm a little too far south to be able to give you a good answer on those terraces, but i'll give a hack at it."
"yes, yes, you got it. i didn't realize you were that far upslope."
"roger. we're ready to try a vhf check, if you will. we'd like you to go to vhf antenna, left, and all of you turn off your s-bands and turn on your vhf t/rs."
that's the only thing i know this morning.
roger.
"manual att, three of them, rate command."
circulate that cool water in you.
say them again.
jce.
roger.
now we need the drogue.
"give me a yell when you start to go, and i'll try to be sure to be there with the camera."
good.
"understand. 06 05 tl 08 lmp-eva okay. that's about the same distance, tony."
"okay. give me vhf ranging, will you please?"
"hello, houston; apollo 14. how do you read?"
okay.
it's the command module's gimbal lock i'm worried about.
okay; understand plus 7 and 250 on the high gain.
go ahead.
"well, it's clear we've got one or two of them left here, you know, and i'll just keep it handy, and take them until - until the ... turns red, you know?"
"yes, sir."
"well, joe. that's one of the mysteries that we'll probably have to keep to ourselves."
did they tell us to charge a bat this morning?
"15, houston. we'd like to ask if you've got full zoom there?"
"okay, 3 is off, and 2 is on."
- - 5 - 565. 565.
"pete, we concur. no tape."
and we have s-ivb ignition.
30; 3.
roger. give us a mark.
there you go.
roger.
"okay. we're calling this tlc-la, step 6, ""transfer to lm power."" 02 02 35 23 lamp all right. stand by 1, joe."
"i agree with you, and i guess we'd better terminate that battery b charge and keep an eye on that thing. if it gives - gets above 3, give us a call. and also -"
that's affirmative.
"mag foxtrot, or franny, i guess we changed it to. mag donna. the dsea. mag echo. mag linda. mag mary."
rcs pressure.
"al, can you find - can you find the earth?"
"apollo ll, houston. logic checks good. you're go for pyro arm."
(laughter)
charlie?
"well, that's a busy little thing anyway. nothing in the - we do not undock before ye get aos?"
"loud and clear, charlie; i'm talking to myself."
roger. we're seeing that geno. looks interesting.
"okay, bob, i was looking at the flight plan, and it said field of view is 4 degrees."
"okay, aquarius. you're looking good."
"ken, can you observe whether it's possible for sunlight to directly impinge on portions of the spacecraft equipment ?"
"well, ..."
- - and it'll give us good data for later.
okay. (laughter) you got that camera. that's the color camera.
okay.
... move over some ....
goody.
"okay. wait a minute. okay. you got to come right, a lot, more, now - more, now up. now right. okay, right. you see them?"
"okay, but, jack, you're doing quite well in the picture department - you're not getting too far behind or ahead. copy that, gene? lmm-eva nos but i mean i'm not getting the coverage i've - i'm not sure i'm getting the coverage i should."
"okay. a-3, a-4, a-5, and a-6 are as you have on your list right now. i1 03 14 33 cc we copy."
understand that it is just west of the crater (columbia) juliett 0.5 and 7.7. is that correct?
that's ... - -
"well, we see on this biomed that old charlie woke up. he was really sawing away there."
move that thing out of the way. 06 03 10 18 _ where's the data hook?
"roger. we copy, fred."
eagle. roger. we copy. it's great. go.
"well, you can turn it on any time you want to. 00 03 20 37 i24p okay, i just thought maybe you had some goodies to ..."
i didn't mean to breathe up all that oxygen.
"donius [sic]. there's le monnier, the landing site. i can't -"
okay. i'm going to enable jets charlie 3 and dog 3. disable bravo 3 and alfa 3.
"okay, aquarius. and down here we're getting re- grouped, trying to work on your control modes and trying to set up something for ptc and taking a look at consumables as opposed to flight plan, and so forth, and as soon as we get all that in- formation, we'll pass it up to you. we also have the 14 backup crew over in the simulators looking at dock burns and also trying to see what kind of alinement procedures they can come up with for looking at stars out the window. so if you ever are able to see any stars out there and think you can do an alinement out the window, why let us know."
"mark my words. there's victory over there, i bet. see that's the long edge."
"oh, that's right, l0 bravo. i knew i'd never get that straight. how fast do you think we're going, jack, without looking?"
you have a master alarm; that's hi 02 flow.
okay; go ahead.
"oh, okay. that's okay."
"yeah, it was."
think we'll use a mag that has some film in it.
"okay, fred. i copied 2.5 amps. say again the volts, please. 04 16 25 15 i_mp 34.3 and that was just a little bit below 2.5."
"well, in just a minute, it'll be me."
i'm just now beginning to understand what went on.
roger.
yeah.
we got 132:'37.
"15, the tv picture is beautiful, and we're going to give that cameraman an honorary union card."
"dave, we're happy. it looks good."
yeah.
"no, but your comments about _ shal'fer and the explanations were quoted in the paper last night."
"range/range rate. 03 23 34 31 i24p shaft/trunnion, plus or minus 50, you've got· okay, mode to slew. temperature is okay. select secondary gyros."
"okay, 158."
who's shining in the sunlight?
yes. after the platform.
"well, now."
okay. give us 1 minute to cheek the p23 dmna_e.
okay. and i'm moving over to connect the side cable to the central station.
okay; 800 feet is what we're waiting on.
"okay, so now we're up to - we've got to do dap set, the gimbal/throttle test."
yes.
"okay; ken just turned the camera over, you can have him turn the other way now."
k_lat'd you say? you must be blind.
put the second one on.
(laughter) is that all you can say for it?
"copy. ""manual range input,"" step 7 to ""verb 25 noun 26, enter all balls."""
"okay, that's third column, two lines from the bottom?"
good show.
- - ... now you can close it.
roger. houston is reading you loud and clear. and did i understand pcm high?
"apollo 17, houston. over."
said stand by a little bit and they'll digest this.
i'll get on.
plss hoses. remove lower - -
"roger. and was it a 0.6 delta-p when you started this, as before?"
"and what are the new settings, houston?"
"three bags of water, let's - i better put it that way, i guess."
back up a hair?
easy.
okay. mag's changed.
"how's that? 06 05 25 26 l_-eva okay. well, i mean the lag - the shadows - you'll be able to see it fine. okay. houston, you was_t to reset?"
yes.
okay; we're going mode switch to 1.
okay.
"givs us a 15-second warning if you - can, stu."
"boy, this thermal coating doesn't mean a thing here. 164 i'confid'ent!:a )ay"
"this thing is off tape start, isn't it? imp-eva oh - if this thing doesn't change."
okay.
hallelujah. (columbia)
yes. but it looks like everything's here.
(laughter) in a minute. canyou reach it? okay. good thing you can reach it. i think that's where my ops is.
"we got floor samples and about - that sample is going into bag ll, tony."
"when am i going to eat? 03 08 5_ 48 lmp ... 03 08 58 49 cml° no, go ahead and finish your - -"
i'm sure that we aren't supposed to do that some- place in here.
"did we get a mark there on 'the gravimeter, gene?"
because i don't remember - i can't honestly say i went around there and looked at this number.
"okay; well, let me get these samples out of the way. oh, i'm sorry_ i'm sorry."
"okay, ken. we're ready to go. do you think vox might make it easier for you?"
okay.
"go ahead, houston."
"okay, at 270:50, change your verb 49 attitude to 090, 180, 010."
i think there's a lot of space in the bottoms of them.
okay. do you see any such mantle on - -
"jim, that's beautiful. the squeal's gone and you're 5 by. and we're ready to go to the next step."
and the tsbs are up behind jim.
better turn the ...
"well, not quite. we haven't found a place to put all of it, to be honest with you. but we're looking."
mark.
looking for number 12.
"yeah. there's one farther around though, on the southwest rim, john s that - that sticks out like it's eroded away from underneath it."
"sure don't see them in here, ken."
okay. and the rover ... should be fairly flat for the ole gravimeter.
"okay, ron."
"okay. the four inverters of this ac bus volt, fred."
rate 2.
"okay. we copy. 04 l0 54 0b cc okay, challenger. torque them."
"15, this is houston. how do you read?"
"15, houston. we're estimating cut-off about 4 seconds earlier than the pad time."
isn't that beautiful?
"yeah, i can smell it."
"hey, al, go ahead."
the lm consumables - -
"okay, will do. and - now - these cases are not all inclusive. these are just some examples that - that we can bring up to you. first of ail, the tvc relay is enabled when you select ma2_vjaloptics. it is then subsequen-ly disabled if you go from ma_al to auto, or if'you go to zero the optics with manual selected, or if you go with m_qnual - with the manual optics selected, if you go from p52 to po0. but these are probably not the only cases; they're probably just some examples that we know of. 02 02 40 11 cml° okay."
"and, endeavour; houston. over."
what's your problem?
"oh, man, i don't like that. okay. i'll watch it."
i'm afraid so.
i'm reading l0 percent.
"eight, gray."
okay; we understand. 04 09 02 00 lmp-l_ sure y'all can get all that.
"how am i doing, jim_"
"oh, okay."
"orion, you're go at 1."
the bottom part of the hole is - is almost un- covered. the bottom one - i'd say the bottom - one - one-fourth of the hole is un - is - is not covered.
"yeah, i agree."
"and, houston, we had a restart on our computer and we had a pgncs light and the restart resf.£."
that's for sure.
"take a picture of that and then - and then - your locator, i'll get it."
yes. yes.
my hrmmer just got hung up in the instrument panel.
"cc_e on down, baby. here it comes. stiff, but come on. 04 18 58 56 t_mp-eva there it is."
yeah.
okay. you go. get a picture of it.
it does?
"boy, i've got to clean m_ camera; i can't even see. what area are you going to rake?"
"okay, geno. we turn our plss water on."
"okay, joe. the covers are open, x-ray is on, and alpha particle coming on now."
pum2 aci's on on the secondary loop.
"plus 2, and it's oscillating. minus 2, and it's oscillating about 1 degree each, and it's oscilla- ting in the center, it is not divergent, however. well - now it's gone to trim, and it's oscillating about plus or minus - almost 2 degrees - or plus or minus 1 degree. i'm going to turn it off -"
"all right. nothing, bob."
"okay, fine."
"and, houston; casper will need a state vector for a ... to be ready?"
"(laughter) okay. 06 02 25 p4 lmp-eva i can't get my left leg in front of me. oh, the docs never knew."
now we can see the helmet stowage bag - -
it has? maybe you're out of film.
okay. the rest of them 1/87
roger. and i'm now dusting that sample.
ail right. here it goes. i 05 13 38 34 lmp where it came from.
roger.
"okays gordo. at 237 in the flight plan, where it's ""pan c_vz_ra, 0perate,"" we'll ignore the barber pole. we'll run for 5 minutes and we'll shut it do_n on your cue."
"yes. we've looked, and - -"
you want to turn down some of the lights?
"yes, we're higher, even though we're slower; we'll probably be a little early. 03 1_ 28 lk lmp what are you coming up on, stu? okay. you - you're coming up on 111:20. 03 14 28 28 @_p we ought to ]deable tc see ... out there. we're _ast about north of it. you know, it's not as dark - the mare's not as dark as i expected it to be."
"x, z, y, ed. x, z, y. i1 confiden""i ii,l"
"okay. if you'll call up verb 05 26, it'll slide over. right now you're not reading the third register."
"okay, still holding at 2.0 on the delta-p."
wait a minute. i want you to do something.
"hey, jim, what did you do with those tissues that were over here? remember?"
"oh, we'll go ahead and do that. do you have any objections to our going ahead and going to the attitude?"
"uplink squelch, off."

*** apt to overdo it.
both these dumps.
i don't know where the hell that came from.
yeah. 04 00 47 40 _ what did it look like?
"roger. does it look like that one we saw on the track the other day? i_4p yes, very much like that one that you almost caught. look at that. there's a tongue depress - several of them - grabens in here. we must be out on the edge of serenitatis now, right?"

"those two regoliths seemed to be pretty - pretty much the same, sort of loosely consolidated and you sink right in. the one that i thought was impressive was up at north ray where you - where it was very shallow, and you didn't sink in at all. did you - do you remember anything being different about the two regoliths - between the lm and stone?"
okay.
"ken, houston."
"yes, we're climbing off."
"okay. at your convenience, we'd like to verify or check the primary accumulator fill valve on until the primary accumulator quantity - that's for the glycol loop - is up to 50 to 55 percent. this is the result of a review of the eva checklist for tomorrow. it ass_-,es that this has already been checked and that w_'re at the 50 to 55 per- cent level so we'd like this check - you could do it tonight when you're getting ready for sleep or something."

appreciate it.
"roger, dave. and when you hold it together, we can read you loud and clear. so that's the problem. i guess we need a tape job on that antenna."
"every time you turn around, there is something else to see and wonder what's causing it. whether it's a particle zipping across the window, or one zipping across the cabin, or spring mechanics here in zero g; there's always something going on."
"okay, ron. we copy all that. o! 22 15 20 cmp yes. i think there is a general migration of - of the cells. kind of toward the bottom of the circle, if you want to look at it that way. they seem to be stretching kind of in that direction, too."

right. a chip off the bottom and the soil will probably do it.
no. okay. so let's not put anything on the dac.
"i guess this - the pan's mine, isn't it, this one?"
"al, we seem to be at the right altitude and we can bring up the high gain if you'd give us a pitch, minus 45; and yaw, 208."
"this thing says i have to have four servo loops to do the circ. every time i put number 2 servo on, it's okay until i disturb it, and then it starts to oscillate. and you can feel the spacecraft shaking. it's really doing it."

"oh, delete the p from ptc."
"vhf b, receive."

okay. (columbia

good. step on this; i'm trying to get it stretched out flat. there.
"okay; thank you, ed. and appreciate all your help, too. the coremwas super today, and every- body back there was right on top of it all the way. we sure - sure appreciate that help."
"hey, are you - no, you're right at the edge of cochise. aren't you?"
"no, no. try all the settings. you know the - it works ... - this is where it works going down - right there."
"casper, we have a noun 93."
"go ahead. 08 05 08 36 imp as long as i'm lying here waiting for a flash, i might cnmment that dave and i both observed the flashes while we were - on the surface. while we were in the bunks down there, we observed the flashes with the - oh, about the same frequency as we observed in orbit. one night there was about a 5-, 10-minute period there where i was awake, and i ran a little experiment by just turning over in the bunk. it seemed like the frequency was much less when i was lying on my stomach as opposed to lying on my back. it's just a note of interest. tape 127/_"

"okay. gee, i wish we had color."
okay. you want the new ones.

"eon, i just heard the voice quality has been real good. we've listened to it several different times, and it's been real good and we can bring it in without too much problem. probably wouldn't be ready for the next rev, but we can get it in here without too much strain, if you want it brought in."

"okay. so far, it looks as tight as it was yesterday. l_°-lm another 30 seconds. maybe lunar dust is a good sealant."
"okay; charlie, the - the valve didn't act the way we thought it was going to. it's been oscillating down and back up on the flow rate, and we were gonna try to catch it in midcycle. and this time, when we went to auto, it just went up pretty high and it's oscillating a little, but it's staying high. we're gonna watch it for a couple or 3 more minutes, and if it doesn't work, we'll probably have to go down below the couch here and play with the manual valve. 09 06 03 12 i_mp okay. that'll be the trick of the week in our present configuration."

"okay; roger. and what we'd like you to do, gene, is we'd like you to get the csvc samples yourself, that will essentially be your sole task at this station, jack can do the solo sampling and we'd like to get one pan and the gravimeter, and then we'll leave this station. we're going to absorb some of the time we spent with the extra gravimeter reading and some of the time we absorbed at sta- tion 2 in the longer stay time in sampling at station 3. that's our plan. so it will be cdr for the csvc for the long cans, excuse me, and"

"hank, we're gonna start, and we're gonna give you something in a little bag first, and i'll give a mark when we start it and when we stop it and when i see particles start to slow down, and then we'll go emptying the bigger bag."
"okay, we're starting a little bit head - ahead of time on the eloseout here, and we'd like you to take your time and make sure we get everything."
"aquarius, houston."
roger. copy that.

"tv coming in good now, joe?"
"and, we'd like your frames before you load up."
didn't go as far.
"yes, that's off."
"i might tell you that we're looking at right now, that round bag that's just behind fred holds our vacuum hose; and when we get back inside the lm we'll hook the vacuum off our suits, and it's resting or it's attached to the hatch which will - we will open to go on to the lunar sur- face, and, of course, to come back in. the hatch which we have come to now is a round hatch, which is our docking hatch between the - between odyssey and aquarius."
okay; good clean sep.
okay. oh.
okay.
"casper, you're coming up on t-stop."
okay; wide dead band attitude hold.
okay.
i didn't have any trouble nulling the velocity.
"roger, al."
"okay. vance, are you there? oh 07 50 17 cc roger. go ahead. oh 07 50 21 lmp okay. the picture that jim gave me on his view through the coas was within the - the partial earth, the lit portion laying in the top half of the coas with the cusp laying right on the y-y line. and so the - the whole dark part of the earth would be at the bottom part of the earth, except a very thin crescent of the dark part to a line - line above the y-y line."
yes. okay. the pghs and the rendezvous radar agree.
okay.
"well, we don't see any correlation either, but we're trying to look for some."
but i want to go 10 degrees off our takeoff angle; and i think i'm headed out about that way now.
no - -
"only listen to about half of what goes down, will you?"

okay; 3 minutes and we're go.
"fdai scale, 5/5."
"okay. dave, i guess our discussion around here - we had proposed 5 at one time, and it was a change to your normal procedures of putting the other _ bank on, so i guess it's really your choice in this regard; 5 seconds is just as good as 3."
we've lost high bit rate. we have one more - - 04 07 57 50 c_r-l__ verb 33 entered.

"okay, ron. and whenever you're ready, pan camera power to off."
okay.
"houston, how do you read the lmp."
"okay,, 3. lrv powerdown ... lr ... be a good ... for the uv, charlie."
are you in ...?
that's right. let's get the suit fan stuff.

okay. i guess we're through with those samples.
"right up there, you mean?"
yes. time to look for more ....
"get out of this block field, we'll be able to move it a little bit."
copy that. now we need the kilogram of the soil.
you can read out 433 at your pleasure.

"bob, when we come out of ptc, then you want us to go right to the sim door jett attitude?"
"okay, yeah, that's good. 04 00 32'34 cdr - - the ones that's cleared up."
"0k_. well, we'll do with what we have, then."
roger.
"hey, go with the rest of the updates, bob."
"okay. well, we're atmost there. the next event on our schedule is for me to go to the docking attitude."
"... it as well as the - some of the more eratosthenian craters around saenger. looks to me like you can still have a little bit of a hint - at least of the layering, or a broken-up different-colored material at the top of all these craters."
there's ullage.
"i's just playing with the polarizing filter again, and it looks as if - when you have the knob on the filter parallel to the - roughly parallel to the polar axis of the earth, - you get maximum darken- ing. and, of course, the opposite 90 degrees to that you get maximum lightening of the globe. and, in the - in the case of australia, it also appears to lighten and darken, but not to the extent of the - of the ocean areas."
"yes. 04 12 52 02 l_p okay, pitch down and right. didn't like that one. that's a good mark there."
"wouldn't have missed it for anything. 07 o0 09 06 lmp-i_ thank you, joe."

"okay_ jack. that fdai power, off, is to stop momentary gliches as you bring up the bmag to put it on, and you turn right around and put tile fdai power rig_it back on 1."

roger. that's it.
"sounds pretty good. ttow about at,[,i1lago? 04 ih 15 11 cc same. everything's smooth there, too."
"okay, now i_m going to go over here, over just a little so i can turn around. oh, you did your circuit breakers? the best i can; easy does it."
"okay; turning to my page. on day 5 meal c, you can scratch the chocolate pudding, and i ate every- thing else plus the eva beverage. john, also, had an eva beverage. on day 6 meal a, i ate every- thing but the ham steak. over."
"okay, bob. this looks just like our old friend, the pyroxene gabbro with the shiny ilmenite plate- lets in the vugs and partially recrystallized vesicles. the textural variations ere planar, end they're prim-_ily - subplanar in the concentrations of vesicles."
"okay. gordo, up until this time, the bird has looked beautiful - perfectly plain. all the check's have come out just as advertised."
"okay, karl. tell you what, i'll give you a call back in about l0 minutes when i'm ready."
"hey, jim. we got the rendezvous radar in detent, too. can we move it out of the way or can we select another star?"
"your bag is still open part way, too."
"well, are we going to have any lunch? _at do you want ? 00 0! 23 26 i2_p 28."

"no, there's no way to get that (laughter)."

"okay. it's a pretty good one, but it's too big to sack, unfortunately ... - -"
"and, houston; i'm back in the lm without a great deal of problem."
that's a good plan; wish i'd thought of that.
stand by.
"roger, dave. is that down towards head valley? 04 11 08 53 cdr-seva trafficability up - right. down - yes, that's correct. and the trafficability up to the northern complex looks the same. i see no large boulders. the slopes go up maybe 5 *** 10 degrees at the most. and beyond that, all the terrain looks pretty - pretty smooth. i can see some young, fresh craters in our vicinity, which are sort of interesting in that there's some very small debris - in the crater itself and on the rim, and it's somewhat lighter gray than the general surface, the debris being on the order of, oh, centimeters or so, but quite young and fresh. and i see a - at 8 or 9 - or 3 o'clock, a very deep crater, old crater, smooth. but i can't even see the bottom, and it can't be more than, oh, 60, 70 meters away. i think that's one of them i was avoiding on the way in. that very mel - well may be november."
"apollo 16, houston."
"and falcon, houston."
yes.
"piece of tape coming up. i'll tell you, gordo, it's remarkably clean up here. it doesn't look like the snowstorm that i remember coming into last time."
that's good. okay. cycling bravo.
"oh, shoot. do it."
"yes, until i get that up for a fit."
okay.
"okay. that's the configuration we want you in, and here's what we're thinking about. when we went to tank 1 auto, tank 2 off; we found that the heater cycle had a tank 1 pressure of about 233 psi, which is well above the caution and warning limit, and if we go to that configuration for sleep, we'll keep from getting caution and warning lights dltring the sleep cycle. okay. in order to do that comfortably, we want to spend the rest of the day using more h2 out of tank number 2, so as to get an unbalance in favor of tank 1, so at the end of the sleep cycle it'll all come out even. and that's why we have you in t_k 1 off, tank 2 auto, now. we expect to get about a 3-percent unbalance over the next 10 hours; and prior to sleep, we'll call you to reverse the configuration again. now the only disadwmtage here is that, during tile day, you will probably get a few caution and warnings, and we just figured it would be better to get them now than while you were sacked out. over."
"john, you're gonna get a feedwater tone in the near future."
wouldn't it be easier to rake downhill.
"okay. i'll get it. look, don't forget - to make sure that this is the ..., you got to make sure that ... if the handle's really turned the ops off, why, you're sunk. also, make sure that the thing's in there good and tight. if you don't, it'll blow off and run out and you'll be out of ops."
"okay. step 4 is ""attitude control: yaw, to mode control."""
"pete, are y'all satisfied with our antenna setup?"
what about the one coming west?
"reading you loud and clear, _ys."
"okay. now i heard earlier that you could see double spot with binocs. does that sound right, ken?"

"okay. let me get to it later, joe."
"okay. understand. keep the h2 purge line heater, cancel the p52, and the set of lines below h2 line heater on, and keep the h2/o2 fuel cell purge."
"okay, let me read you some questions about f-crater, if you will. if you'll direct your attention to f-crater. we'd like to know the shape of the crater profile, the rim crest, and probable or possible breaching, the smoothness and distribution of rim deposits, and the superposition-relationship with family mountain or family hill."
"yes. yes, we'll just finish off jim's collection hag here. i want to stow it anyway. oh, look at that glass spherel - spherule down there. see that big one? i got to - listen -- 06 02 04 07 ia{p-eva oh, yes. i see it."

"can you - o0 02 06 ok cdr not with the seat down, you can't, charlie."
what say? put it back up? yes.
"okay. that's affirmative. so, in general terms, what we're going to have to do is to power up the ags and bring up the ags eight-ball, and then to set up your a_titude, put the coas in the front window, and guidance control will be in ags, of course. but manually orient the spacecraft to place the center of the earth directly out the z-axis. then rotate about the z-axis to place the point of the crescent on the y-axis of the coas. l_d this will have your plus x-axis in the direction of the surl as we discussed before. so the crescent will be up with the point down. copy that?"

"well, the way to do that is just to play it straight from now on."
"yes, it's coming down to us in living stereo."

okay. the only thing i don't understand about that is why it took off at the rate it did. what rate should it have taken off at under that theory?

okay. delay the bat b charge to 244. and be advised - you've got to know that we've got the best navigator in tranbearth lunar space up here.

"when you combine them with the limited area that you have to look in because of the lm reflections, you find the telescope to be very unsatisfying."

okay. see you around the other side. on the flight plan schedule now -
"right. the only other thing i can vhink of when i look at it through the aot is - it did appear to be coming from one spot, but that's the only difference although i can't see where it is com- ing from because it's beyond the curvature of the command module. but, it appears like it. _ ir-bt be coming from more than this one spot."

oh boy.

"i can see anything - everything from fine-grain basalt as i come running across the area here, to - coarse - a few coarse-grain ones; i see some - sort of light reddish-gray colored rock that i would call - i don't know really what i would call it; it looks almost like a granite, but, of course, it probably isn't, but it has the same sort of texture. the individual components - constituents, so to speak, are crystals, but it still has that same appearance. they'll have a chance to examine one closer."

i've about worn out this piece of gum; i could go for another one.
"for a minute or so. and, jack, i guess right now, you might get some fairly rapid samples in the area, since you're probably almost ready to leave. and can you tell us what you saw there in the vicinity of the - you were giving us a description of the boulders there and plateness of the - and alignment of the crystals - the plag. you want to amplify that a little bit?"
"well, there's noth - no need to worry. i was going - i was going to ... - -"
"oh, it stands - it's a meter wide and stands about a third of a meter high."

yes.
"okay, joe. i - there's so much here, i could talk to you forever. but, there - there's a large - i can see now, we were in zero phase and without taking a close look out the front window, i couldn't tell you --but, as i was coming down trying to select a spot to land, i was trying to avoid these 8- to 10-meter craters. and we have one out of our 4 o'clock - i guess about 3 or 4 o'clock that i discussed before. there is one directly in front of us almost - the rim is almost on the shadow of the radar antenna right now, and it appears to be an 8- to 10-meter one. and there's one over to our l0 o'clock. they're just all over, and it was sort of hard to find a spot that was really level."

go ahead.
"hey, don. can you tell us how we're doing on time?"
"endeavour, this is houston. it's time to turn off the mapping camera."

okay; i'll pick up - i'll pick up the _sa. okay?
"hello, america; houston. standing by."
roger.
"163:40, okay. go."
"go ahead, houston."
yes.
"okay. yes, that's right side up. not, yet, i haven't got them all on there."
"roger. and if you'd like settings, we recommend f/8 at 1/250th with a 250-millimeter lens."
"well, we'll get the padded bags later."
woo-hoo-hoool
what's the cabin?
that's affirm.
can you get -
what's that time on the other one? time on the dsky?
careful with the lcru. one dust cover came off. careful with this baby. that's the real one.
"houston, this is the most spectacular view in the - you can possibly imagine."
"now, in answer to question 2, there was, of course, a vibration transient in the second stage that - due to the number 5 engine going out - which occurred shortly before the engine went out, and slightly after that then the s-ii stage was very smooth."
roger.
wouldn't you - if we do not undock until the ...
"mine is, too."
good job.
that clock is off again.
okay.
... you haven't rolled ... last ... okay.
it's all dark now.
okay.
okay.
where do you want this? in your ...?
"okay. okay. where we came up over here, john, it - it won't be quite to - they get a better view. right here's where they get a great view of the - of the interior of the upper third of the wall. okay. tony, we're on the rim."
okay.
"endeavour, houston. over."
okay. fine.
"extend that docking tunnel index, minus 3.5. 01 09 15 h6 cc minus 3.5. 01 09 24 19 chp houston, casper."

"standby, jack."
those optics ... are superb.
"yes, sir. there's no question about it. i - any - any force at all that moves it up makes it go tmstable. looks like that ... movement ... 04 03 23 41 i/4p ]esthat main b? is it run off main b?"
at 3.0.
"oh. i wasn't worried, gene. watch that block there; it's probably more than 14 inches. and got a fairly close look at the rock, and it is the vesicular - looks very much like the vesicular clinopyroxene gabbro."
"okay, pitch of 20 and 185 on the yaw."
- - and john's on the biomed now.
go ahead_ bob.
roger. we concur.
"roger, gene. boulder tracks are not obvious on sculptured hills at all. it looks like there are fragments over there that would have had their sources higher up the slope. i think we can get boulders there. tap 109a/5"
okay.
this one towel is clean; we only brought - - there's four books that have got to go back.
no. way out here! look at this - -
"- - three, to - att i/rate 2."
"yeah, you'll have to open the door and find out. 07 i0 04 41 l_ okay, houston -"
"okay, let's look it up. verb 6, noun 20, 1.21, 272.7 - yeah. yeah, 3.44. that's good."
okay.
and it's about b meters - 3 meters - 3 meters from the hole. well -
and there might be diamonds in the next one.
"roger. copy those. and onboard readol.ts, d is 69, c is 73, d is - let me start over again. okay. a is 51 and b is 62; c is 63 ancld is 59. over."
"no, go ahead, make your park."
"16, 0mni chariie."
thank you.
just check this one. good. all right.
you got it.
ail look green to me. okay.
"okay; on the last one, it was 221:59, circuit breaker 02 heaters - 100 watt heaters, three, main b, closed. and then going back to the entry for a - f a t-start time of the pan camera of 220:15:25, and run the camera to film depletion, t-lkback barber pole."
"ail right, hank. how about doing one thing for us, then? if this is going to be the basic time line, and we're going to use these pages, is it reasonable to get you to give us a clock sync somewhere - so we - i'm afraid if i keep scratch - scratching out times arid all in here, i'm going to miss something important."
"okay. well that was indeed a sm_ll crater, so i guess the question was right. 05 0b 57 59 cc let me change the mode here and ask you three or four simple _lqep questions again, to verify for various people, exactly what happened. just to make sure that they're clear on it. when - jack, when you were laying out the geophone leads, you mentioned and asked me if it was all right if the geophone leads crossed one another, if there was emi problems. and so that made people wonder whether or not it was possible the geophone positions were reversed; i.e., geophone i was laid out in geophone 2s' direction, et cetera."
"ac utility power, 201's off."
is it?
...
"okay. loud and clear. 04 09 07 38 _ loud and clear. tape recorder's on, s-band - ... 04 09 08 03 _ houston, i have you locked up on the steerable. 04 09 08 15 _ okay, let me keep you honest, al. 04 09 08 28 l_ _ i ... hold off on it until you do."
...
"well, that might be the point. we'd like to go your suit gas return back to cabin. give it a try."
00. 03 o1 13 56 imp go. 03 01 13 57 imp ... 16 72 ...
okay. have you guys got a suggestion of what meal you want us to eat?
okay. we'll start with display number 1.
loud and clear.
"you know, they made a gross tactical error; they should have rigged the lm up so the csm power could power the imu. and you could bring the imu up enroute and align the goddarn thing, you know, maybe get a good drift check on it and all that crap."
"roger. that's 13 degrees left of the shadow. and, next question relates to the depth of the bulk sampling that you obtained near the first part of the eva and any changes in composition that you might have observed during the bulk sampling interval. over."
"okay, houston. do you copy 13's torquing angles on the p527"
"okay, dave, that sounds good. now a word about the circuit breaker. you might want to cycle it a couple of times - but before we go through this, just to make sure it's not a lot stiffer than what you're used to working with in the simulator. and just get some idea of how it's best to - to position yourself to pull this. it's also not all that critical that it - that it get pulled abso- lutely immediately, but - you know, what - whatever's comfortable to do. it might make it easier for us on trimming up with your midcourse if we do get a burn."
okay; how do you read now?
exactly what he said·
"- - mode. sep light's on at 36. okay, s-ivb ullage starts right now. anybody feeling the ullage?"
"okay, hang on a second and i will. load it ... ... procedure."
s-ivb has impacted.
okay.
"okay. get the camera, and i'll give them a grav- imeter reading. is that all you need? because i'll go get the flag."
yeah.
"flus - plus h.5, fredo."
we don't have any idea why it broke. it didn't look like there was anything in the isa which could have done that to the - just the face of that meter. the isa had mostly soft equipment. it was pretty well padded.
"look out that window! 00 03 02 56 i2_p yes, look at all that crap."
minus 0.8.
how big?
okay.
...
was this a pretty deep one?
"i doubt it. not when you consider the fact that we got to get - how many hours it's gonna take to get suited up and jettison the la{tomorrow. it's gonna take all day to do that. well, what do you got to do now?"
no. it couldn't be it then.
do this according to hoyle.
right; 24.
let's update the det.

yes.
"okay, the biomed data looks good."
"okay, ken. now we are getting a picture."
"america, we see your cabin at 5.4, and we'll keep an eye on it. cml° okay. give us a little call there ahead of time, and i'll crack the ... right now - -"
"okay, vance. how are you reading now?"
it's probably done.
okay.
coming over chaplygin.
"okay; i'm probably going to have to maneuver it so you can get a ... lockup, where i am ..."
okay_ my circuit breaker's are okay except -
"looks like a major circulation system off the southern tip of africa, as gene mentioned, plus one west of that, 20 or 30 degrees of longitude. make that east of that."
"roger; intend to - and - in regard to your comments about king, was there any other thing back - on the back side that you had of interest?"
look at that.
(laughter) ail night long with no biomed.
"well, that data file is supposed to be available to us - yes, put it in the purse - should be available to us in debriefing."
"it came right ... accumulator cycle, along with the high 02 flow again."
"we - when we get in, we want to cheek over all those damn - books, make sure we got them. oh, i put them all in my mouth, pete; sorry. wasn't thinking."
"got enough? ll 06 51 27 _ hold it, al. it's still going - -"
"roger. i understand. we'll get back to you in a minute, charlie."
"houston, tranquility. say again which one should (tranq) be closed?"
"it's your druthers, ken. if you want to do it that way, that's fine."
"well, - pretty much, i think, bob."
"yes, sir."
okay.
"oh, yes. this thing is a lot harder to turn than it was in training."
- - 105 and 3.1.
"casper, houston. we've got a bunch of pads to get up to you. the first one i've got for you i_: your - a range update, whenever you're z'easy t_ copy."
"okay, it should be stable- -"
ail right. i can't do it right now.
"and, bob, from my rendez - from the right-hand rendezvous window when the tower jett occurred, there seemed to be a lot of burning particles streaming away from it. i could not see - did not notice or remember seeing the actual cover or tower itself; but i - we were inside the cone of the burn and with a lot of streaming. it looked very much like a sky rocket - portion of one at any rate. reminded me of the fourth of july out in silver city a few years ago."
i don't have a bag.
"that's not fair. i was really going to - i really did forget, because i was going to engage you in some verbal discourse to distract you so that you would let me forget it and i could redeem myself."
how come that?
i can use the thruster configuration i have now.
okay.
"i said that :really looks neat. i can see it c{_uncing a little bit - - 05 11 38 !_o cdr yes, it bounces a little. 05 11 35 h3 cc -. - and your tracks are quite visible."
"that's that little extra whining you hear, and it's the secondary loop."
"okay, that's good. *** gnomon, and we won't roll it over on the gnomon."
"it's real hard to say. i'd say if there is, it's like a plateau though, hank - very subtle."
"okay. well, i'll - just a minute ... bags ... 07 22 22 51 _ i'll eat ken's grit_ ...."
i know it.
okay.
dave. sorry - -
"okay. copy that. hey, while i think about it, on the landmark tracking there in that lower attitude mark, the computer was pointing me - i wish i knew. i'd have to get a map to look at the name of it, but there i consider sherlock. and then the one to the south of that, and then another one to the south of that. there are three in a row. and it was pointing to the one just south of sherlock - one about the same size as 17-1. okav. a readback on bp-3. t-l, ll2:17:01; t-2, 21:51, 23:31, 24:19; be north, 04 miles."
"all right, god d-_u you, come help me."
okay.
okay. it's still - still level and the sun shadow is still aligned.
95 percent!
"at least the black-and-white does. 00 01 25 0h lmp i'm looking to the north, aren't i - as we're going along?"
"yeah, and ... not so sure - -"
well.
"okay. $con ftdentt 04 20 14 _1 cc al, we copy your cormnent on insertion of that into the ground. how far in are you able to get it? 0_ 20 14 45 lmp oh, i pounded it in over a foot, i'd say; and =t didn't look like it was any harder towards the end than right at the beginning. it's there. it's pretty -"
okay. mine is back off.
"... down here, 16."
okay.
"jack. lmp.eva oh, excuse me. i didn't hear you."
"roger, al."
good. okay. i'll give you - -
"boy, that's a nice idea. _"
it is.
seven g's. ll 01 b0 07 cmp (laughter) it's going to feel it.
"yes, we copied that,"
can you see the little bright ray there?
(laughter) i'm getting soaking wet.
"dirty. 06 04 17 21 _,[p-eva ahl ooops. there we go. okay, we got you about a 4-centimeter chip. 06 04 17 _0 cc okay, that sounds good. just get some photos of it and i - i think we've done it. 06 04 17 38 l_p-eva and that's not glass, john. those are crystals. those are big crystals. at least 5 millimeters, with a bluish cast to them."
... from the same place.
"82, that's good. 130, that's good ... okay, noun 20s all look pretty good."
"yeah, i got them."
"- - scoop, and i'll get the hammer. then make sure your bag is closed."
"well, that's not really true, because - it's - it's so hilly and - and ridgy down in that par- ticular area that you just don't see the rim. and tsiolkovsky is big enough so that you do get some, at least optical, impressions of the central peak being higher than the ridges. but i think it's just because the - the basin is - is big enough, is far enough across, that you're - as you're looking from one rim to the other, the curvature kind of gets to you and - and makes the central peak appear higher than it is. but it is a very, very high central peak; it's a - it's a very large mass. and, as a matter of fact - on the last couple of revs, i've been watching the central peak, and i'm pretty sure that i can see some layering - in - in the central peak there and - there should be some pictures of it. i got some pictures looking down on it. but it looks like a big slab that's been stuck up on edge."
"okay. i'm going to get on the sunset - sunlit side, tony, so i'll know what - i'll know what i'm whacking on here. you know, tony. that might be a permanently shadowed soil right in there. i think it is, as a matter of fact. it'll - it'll pas._."
okay. wait a minute.
"'that could have been - that could have been where it was ... all that shit ... 07 02 57 b1 lmp no, it wasn't supposed to be -"
"yes, sir."
huh?
"and, 13, this is houston. in the lm, we'd like to have 12, step 3, which is get the batteries on high taps. over."
"roger. good readback, buzz. out. end of tap!: apollo 11 air-to-ground voice transcription (goss net 1) tape 65/1 04 04 29 02 cml° neil, i'm maneuvering in roll. (columbia)"
okay.
we've been looking for the big man with the white gray beard.
"hey, we've been making about l0 clicks, tony, and going just super."
...
"there are also some radial grabens; i just now picked one up, which we've also seen on the orien- tale photographs taken by lunar orbiter. it's amazing how fresh appearing this basin looks, con- sidering its great age. but it's - it probably is not - had any more violent a history than imbrium. now, we're getting up, just about to go over a delta-rim crater that's out in the basin. i don't remember the name of it offhand. but it's - should be familiar to some of the geologists who have mapped this basin. it does not appear to have a strong impact ejecta blanket around it. it's filled with mare, and it's quite sharply in contrast to a cra- ter of comparable size to the northwest. see that one, ron; i don't know whether you can get it. i get a good view out of 5 now of that one. and, once again, it looks as if this hackly textured material that forms the higher hills in the inner bench - has a draped appearance over the, over preexisting terrain, and, in fact, along the ridges of the hmlmmoeks, you - we now can pick up little rilles that roughly parallel the hummocks, although not - not - not consistently. they do cross down into the valleys. but it has appearance that there may have been a tensional relief along the crest of each of the hl_mocks, or many of the h-mmocks."
that a boy. okay. now we're cooking.
"cabin gas return, egress."
okay. i'll go back to egress.
you got it.
"then ""atca."" 07 23 42 22 l_ yea2. 07 23 42.23 cc ""atca, open,"" and ""__at'c_(ags), or)eh."" 07, _-_°_42 28 12.'p okay."
"okay. we're at 5 pounds,"
- - due to the antenna switch.
"okay. we're going to jog on here for a little bit, houston, and get a little bit closer to the surveyor and look her over. 05 13 52 53 imp yes. hey, that's coming in from the south; looks like a good way, pete."
"... 43, 4, 5 -"
i thought you were trying to save on your btu's.
"are you maneuvering, ken? 07 09 20 59 cml° yes, sir."
"copy. 07 01 _5 36 cmp well, we finally got a little serendipity, hank."
"it really jerks in yaw, dick. look at that son of a gun, huh? i'm about a half degree out in yaw, here, and that thing's about 3 degrees off in yaw."
"two, off."
"man, i was - i wanted to get up and - i was trying to keep ..."
"well, don't - don't get me wrong. driving that rover is ... but i'll tell you, it keeps your attention."
"and, endeavour, i'll be standing by for when you're ready to copy down the few changes in your flight plan for today. i can bring you up to date over /-_' the next 7 hours or so and get all that out of the way. i'm also curious to know if you've had time to listen to any sea chanties from the hms endeavour up there. over."
yeah. it's converging. rapidly.
okay.
5.2.
okay.
"okay. we're at 60 degrees, huh, charlie?"
"and, 11, it doesn't look llke you're having too much trouble with that bracket up there, buzz. 02 08 18 41 i24p i'll tell you, those new knobs really make it easy to twist the thing and get it cinched down quite tight. 02 08 1850 cc roger."
"houston, are you reading us? over."
"no, that's mine."
okay. and we're going to have ta pack up and head home.
okay. great.
"okay. the title above bat 5 normal feee, on, is ""power up."""
"how about this one, with the inclusion? maybe i can get this one. *** may have been a little optimistic."
"jack, can i look - can i look at that closely?"
"okay. i'll take pictures, then."
"okay. dsky and emb look good, at about 50."
okay. it's - is that a verify?
okay.
"understand you are using the high gain. over. 00 0b 29 48 cdr that's affirmative. 00 03 29 _9 lmp that's affirmative. 00 03 29 ;1 cc roger. i read you very loud and clear, buzz. mike is pretty weak. 00 03 30 (0 lm_p roger. we've got the high gain locked _n, now, i believe; auto tracking now."
"okay. first of all, we'll open the balance cross tie breaker on panel 16."
"it's a good readback, and say again your last? 04 02 43 21 cml° roger, ed. i need a sign on the pitch and yaw trims."
go to the right. that's it. get the ... get the coils out of it.
"13, houston. we'd like you to attempt to recon- nect fuel cell i to main a and fuel cell 3 to main b. verify that quad delta is open."
"which way, charlie? 05 06 19 35 i_mp-i_m well, your hoses are coming from this side, so you got to get to that valve behind you. there you go."
6-c?
we didn't hurt this end of the lm much.
"okay, tony. it looks like it's not as bright in here as we'd like to be able to get it, and we'll try - try timing it with some of the window shades up to see if we can get it a little brighter. with the cabin floodlights, it looks like 1/60 of a sec- ond is about the max i can get off of the 10-millimeter lens. and i was going to suggest either going to the 18, which will give me a little faster shutter speed because it's got a wider aperture, or we'll take a little less photography and just do it when the sun gives us good illumina- tion through one of the windows."
"recorder's, on."
"i'll let jack give you a call. i'm going to start on the pgns, if we're ready."
okay; understand. exchange cmp and cdr prds.
"..., houston. you're still looking good."
mark it. tank 2. we got the squib.
go.
"question 16 for each of you: based on your expe- rience, do you have any recommendations right now for the crew of apollo 177"
"i think we're past mendeleev, if i'm not mistaken. yeah. give you what? huh?"
...
"oh! ... can't - we can't do this - ... i can see ... hoses ... 00 01 lb 15 cdr al, don't ... - -"
"that's the blue-gray - that's the blue-gray bob, with the inclusions in it. now the blue-gray, the more you looked at it, it looks like a - -"
no. we didn't. i'll get a scoopful.
you're on your way.
"okay. _y don't we go ahead and get - okay, here we go. coming 0pe?[. 07 oh 19 09 cdr-lm okay, ... for depress. 07 oh 19 13 cc okay. 07 04 19 42 lm_°-lm there's 1 pound, john."
okay. i'd give - give it few clicks. you're through 200 feet - -
"mark. i'm checking the thurabwheel down to zero, up to 1, back to one-half. the yaw thumbwheel is going over to ... and i don't - let me try it again. there it goes. had the motor on; now i'm turning it off. i'll turn it on one more time. ... it's stable. i'm taking the trim, which is now set at a little over 1 on the thumbwheel, down towards zero. i move it slowly. it gets a little dynamics, and then it stops. i'm going to take it down to zero at about this rate. it oscillates, and now it's diverging, and i'm turning the gimbal motor off. i'm going to hold in this configuration."
"are you going to do it now? okay. well, you know, i ought to get one shot back here with a black and white. i'll get this half black and white."
yeah. roger. eecom's just calling it. we're seeing it drop off here now.
"okay, we'll bring it in."
"okay. and they're all zips, 28300."
roger. we're at 113 miles. and i have you visually out the window as a bright star.
okay. i'll verify the main bus ties are off -

"you are looking - looking to the south along the rim, along the - this side of the rille. dave, could you comment on that horizontal bedding that's probably - oh, at least i kilometer south us? and higher - higher elevation."
roger. we see them.
don't worry. i won't. 00 05 20 1_7 cm ) flight doesn't like it. 00 05 20 5_ cm _ how is flight today?
okay.
go ahead.
this is houston. roger. we copy.
"he's walking - he 's walking around here thinking he doesn't have to do anything any more after that eva, but we'll get him back to work."
see if it does any good. but the vise - ones - or the training ones hold good. there's never any problem with them.
"hey, do me a favor."
"you know the - you can't see into camelot, jack; that rim is - is camelot out in front of us."
okay.
those rocks have been waiting 4-1/2 billion years for us to come grab them. {ionfident
"well, i was thinking of alsep."
be easier since i'm here.
roger. let's just stand by here for a couple of minutes and we'll see how - what the ground has to tell us.
"how's our reading on what? 03 13 55 17 cml° the fuel and oxidizer. what are they? 03 13 55 21 l_ right together; 34.9, 35.1; decreased by about 40 pound - 30 - ho pound."
think we lost comm?
thank you.
"yes, i'd believe it."
"well, it's about 50 percent. about 385."
intrepid; roger.
"america, houston. realize you're eating and don't want to internzot you_ but if you get your headsets on, we'll give you some news. c_ sound grea%_ houston. we'd appreciate that."
"okay, bob. i'm going down the ladder."
"roger. we'll add that, and continue to keep the score."
yes. i need another shot $f cold.
ready to go?
"okay, you need a ..."
"johnny, you ain't gonna believe this, but the food is blown up like - like a balloon."
"okay. i guess we'd like - - 06 03 40 54 lmp-nva tony, this might be a good place - -"
"okay, joe. gainstep is center, and i'm ready on the shape pad."

"al, we'd like to have high gain, auto."
don't drop it.
okay.
okay. 06 03 09 30 12/_p-eva - - push it.
okay. copy that.
"did you get a good look at the earth, charlie?"
"houston comm tech, tananarive."
and an altitude light.
"you can put a thumbprint on there, dave."
"yes, good idea. mine's in the station."
okay. was that index on 6? 06 00 33 41 l_p-eva that's affirmative. going to 7.
roger. copy that.
"okay, all the pan's are done, pete. okay?"
"okay. while charlie's doing - can i see a crystal shape? i saw one clast. one - no. well, the clasts in there are _ery angular; maybe that's a zap crater; that's probably what that is. i don't see in the - the white matrix doesn't have any crystalline structure that i can recognize."
"_kay. i'm going to retarget pgns here, i mean ags here. 514,00000,515. move your hand a bit. there's the problem. plus 4 all zeros, 516, plus 00000_ enter."
"okay, understand. the first three go with those programs, and the cmc thrust vector control is sufficient by itself."
"roger. stand by a second, please. 00 03 45 25 cm} roger. standing by. the reppgss packige valve is now in the off position. wtiat's the cabin pressure now, buzz? cabin pressure is now 4.5."
"really. brush it off. _-- 06 19 35 41 cdr-eva okay, houston. into the cdr's footpan goes mag union."
okay. hold still. 05 23 17 52 imp-eva excuse me.
"okay, copy that. okay, and can you amplify your description going out to station 6. in particular were there blue-gray and tan-gray bands on the north massif?"
"well, helium press, rcs."
"okay. 272:04 [sic] mass spec, discriminator, low vice high."
"okay. copy that, gene. and remember to document around the corner at your ... get some photo documentation of the boulder."
no wonder they're flat lines - it's unplugged.
"good morning, gordy. this is jack."
yes.
"roger. don't see anything down here yet, but we're anti cipating."
what's not? 03 22 05 42 _ that aot thing. 03 22 05 h3 cdr what a0t thing?
"that's nice. 07 23 16 20 i_mp okay, fred."

"oh, boy. man, here comes the bobbsey twins."
capture.
okay.
"oh, i'm sorry, jim. 06 05 14 24 lmp-i_m why don't you pull that strap out, dave? get it out of the way."
that's right on the money.
"no, i mean the television c_mera. i'll put you back where i had you."
"copy, and standing by for the shadow."
a long way to go. i think this torquing switch ... switch that is spring loaded.
okay.
"okay, jim. it should be pretty good now. we copied you answering question number 9."
are you a mess!
"hi, gang. transcript of cof_funications between cc and izmresumed"
"want some help, jack? i'll be there."
okay. we lost you there with an antenna change that we didn't catch. so we're back with you again.
by-by.
"boy, i really like to watch those thrusters fire out there. that's neat-o. when do we - when do we come out in the sunrise?"
yes.
"okay. the tape recorder is in rewind and as soon as we get an antenna switch, we'll start it off for you."
"we'll be ready in about 3 minutes, pete."
"okay, i got the landing site. we're right over the top of it, and the scarp is fantastically detailed at this - can you see in there, gene? right down, right down, straight down there."
"you looked already, huh?"
let me doublecheck that one.
"one of these days, we'll be able to bring the whole mocr along, i hope. save a lot of antenna switching."
roger.

"oh, no; we_ve got a bunch of towels hanging up in the tunnel right now. it looks like somebody's laundry."
am i? thank you.
roger.
sounds good.
"gentlemen, everything looks perfect down here, and - all we can say is, ""have a good burn."""
"- - is, first of all, waste stowage vent valve, closed. 00 02 43 30 cm_ okay. i'll do that right now."
secondary ...
feels like a water valve.
"roger. we're not rushing, just going at it system- atically. we apparently learned how to do it, though, somewhere along the line."
"here comes logic power jett 1 to jett and number 2, jett."
"yes, from the looks of things, bob, down there, it looks like getting off last night was a good idea."

"okay, joe. i don't think there's any question about it from the plumbing standpoint that we could do that if we had to."
"yes, if you got that thing all - you got it all done?"
we need to put more samples per - in the bag. 05 12 45 28 _ and they're saying they can't hardly use those little ones.
okay ....
wrap a piece of that tether around it until we get the cabin pressurized. you got it? okay.
"and, 16, could we get you to tweak the evap out temperature to about 45 degrees? looks like it's about 38 right now, and that's going to be a little ' cold after you get into ptc."
"okay, i'm going to start sampling the soils, and then i'll get you the fragments."
"okay, i still have the pyro a sequence a and pyro b sequence b circuit breakers in. do you want those out?"
understand.
"... check the bright one? boy, look at the junk coming out of it."
"that's quite a bit off from the prediction. i wonder if i - i turned it on at the right time, and i turned it off at the right time."
"okay. there hasn't been a lot of news, but i'll read you what we've got. president - former president trmnan is still holding on. his heart- beat, breathing, and temperature all became unstable yesterday, but then he improved again. a methodist minister in kansas city said, ""he's a rugged guy who's hanging in there and he's going to make it."" the headlines were full of reports of the find of orange dirt and the rest of your adventures yesterday. internationally, the u.s. and north vietnam held intensified secret peace talks, and henry kissinger prepared to return to washington probably this afternoon, i understand, after a final session with le duc tho. the french press said a compromise was in the works on the withdrawal of north vietnamese troops from the south. the houston rockets lost to buffalo up in buffalo last night, but the hockey team, the aeros, took a 6 to 4 win over the alberta oilers. in - really, that's about it on the news, except maybe for the weather, which finally broke. the cold front cleared out the drizzly rain last night, and for the first time since you've launched - that i can remember anyway - we've been able to look up and see the moon, directly. it's a pretty sight as always. that's not much of a report, but that's about all we have. over."
okay; go ahead.
"what kind of desserts we got there, jim? a lemon pudding, huh?"
yes. i got it.
dump my little bag first. time skip lffilllmm
yes.
we - we agree almost exactly with the ground.
"houston, did you miss the question?"
verify.
"oh, they got all kinds of pads as soon as we get fired up here."
"man, look at that,"
"okay. we'll try another one, and it's a little better centered. in fact, the only other one we have that shows the whole picture. we're in the forward d-10 of the aot now, position 2, and you should be seeing something familiar like a radar antenna."
"well, we just waited - -"
"yes, sir. we're getting ... - -"
"roger; understand. that's column bravo, ids 4 and 5, change 4 to 32251, and 5 to 26157."
"okay, but now they're worried that it's stuck like your gimbal thing was last night and, also, the thing is that maybe -we maybe - something's hung up inside, and by moving it we can jostle it free. they do not want it picked up, but they'd like to have uht put in there and sort of have the instru- ment rocked from side to side to again see the bubble move. and once that is done, to then press it down into the ground and again realign it and put the bubble within the inner circle. over. they would also like to see if the gimbal is free."
- - ... ops is in the way in the back here. see if i can squish down here.
"well, okay. those are the last ones that you can take. got a lock?"
"okays bob. i missed that. i didn't give it to you; but i think - well the next bag i take out, you can check the num- well, wait a minute, i'll do it for you."
"that's affirm. yes. it's the - the only 4 on that page 24 and it's a- presently has after it rcs system a/b-2, quads, 4, to auto. under that put - - 05 09 05 3_ lmp roger."
huh?
we're going 35 000 feet per second.
"and, charlie, the lm/cm delta-p is just over 1 pound right now."
we don't seem to see anything worthwhile here doing besides that.
yes. it's got to be. certainly (laughter).
"now, let me check the velcro. wait a minute. let me get ... okay. okay up in there."
okay. we still have 2 minutes to go.
"hey, i think the more - i think from here on out, i'll chlorinate the water (laughter)."
"gamma ray, shield off, and that's plus 10 on the high gain."
all righty.
"okay; take a drink. take a drink, and - i think i've had about enough of the lcg, huh?"
"and if you open the pallet, be careful of the clamp. probably, if it's feasible, we suggest you reach across in front of the pallet. reach across the pallet to do it instead of opening it, because of the clamp on the fender."
i hung up again.
"i was just checking with you; you're so quiet down there, we _lmost forgot you were there."
darn.
"roger, jack. that's interest2ng because on _v prog it doesn't show a thing down that area. this just may not be up to date here yet."
"bob, i have to reiterate. even the small - even the very small - the l- and 2-inch - 3-inch frag- ments that are laying around here have been dusted and filleted - -"
okay.
"and, ken, at 54 hours, you were 2 percent ahead of your rcs budget - that's 25 pounds to the good."
"are there any differences in the cra_ers, ron?"
"well, let's see. l_p not much to see, i realize, but i'm sure somebody's there."
"okay, joe. we - i'm ready to take that last change to the flight plan."
yeah.
yes.
ro_!ier.
"limit cycle's off. 06 15 01 2h lmp rate, high."
"thank you, jim. (tranq)"
"so am i, but ... - i'm just ready enough to get down there and -"
"okay. let's see, we owe you an answer on what to do with the levas. i guess they were supposed to be on the helmets in the pga bag. is that going - to be a real pain to get at, and put them there?"
"and looking at cone crater, where a1 was looking a short time ago, it doesn't appear there is going to be any trouble getting the met up cone crater."
"jim, that's affirm, but we want you to break down the core stem first, please; that is, separate it."
"challenger, we'd like aft omni now."
that's affirmative. we don't have the hoses hooked up. i'll hook up the ho - turn on theair.
"okay, the other number on that core tube is 01, by the way. f"
",)kay."
"57:15, .,. reading on the ball,"
and we are ready to copy on the loi-1.
and fly high and straight and land soft.
"roger. will do, jack. and i'm looking into the aot now to the right - no, the number 4 detent, and we are venting something back there; i can see particles moving on past the command module. what it is, i don't knew."
...
"yeah, it works just like it's supposed to now. 10 o0 58 23 cc i °'' ?con al"
"okay. page 7-10, your p57 lift-off time, upper right corner, is 188:01:43.85. over."
"i did the delta delta-t and got 45.1, by using the delta delta-t thing."
"okay. use - i changed mags, so we can always use that other one - but i don't know what your settings are. they aren't in here. are they supposed to be?"
"orion, vhi_} is houston. select pri_l%ry tp_&nsmitt_ receiver."
here comes the jett bag whenever you're reaay.
okay.
"houston, 16. over."
- - these cameras we got?
"you happy with that, houston? let's get ..."
"how's that now? 0h 04 26 21 cdr oh, it's just not moving very much at all."
"okay, there's 30 feet, i'll just - i'll get this thing squared away when i - 0kay, boyd bolt time."
that was neil. how are you reading mik_?
save us a copy.
okay .... 04 21 49 b0 cdr-lm okay.
"okay, i guess the only thing on that is that we've got a busy day coming, and these things just really take a long time by the time you put on the suit, and then you play with it and then if we have some adjustments to do, too, why, it's going to take a block of time."
"rate, high and update the det."
go ahead.
"okay. well, i guess there were a great many new thrills for me, and the one that was most im- pressive though was the lift-off. it began the flight, and i knew that i w_s going into space after a few years of waiting and training. and then, as far as the event that i would not like to - to repeat again, was probably the time when i fell down in front of the tv when we were deploying the rover."
"odyssey, houston."
what time do we ingress the lm? o4 07 19 54 _ ...
"okay, joe, your tv's going off now."
"okay, everything's right except 15 frames at 10 second intervals - 10."
"*** okay, i'm about 89 degrees - -"
"well, you got 5 minutes."
that's affirmative.

"question 7 for ken: your observations of the land- ing site. did you see the lunar module or the rover, and did you see any differences between cayley and descartes?"
"i'm not saying that at all, john; just thought i would help if i could."
okay. we've got to reverse the rolls of the camera here.
"okay, descent water is off."
"okay, houston. let's hold off on the updates of those other photos, so we can get squared away for the eclipse photos."
"that's affirm. 07 05 4b 47 cdr okay, on the final comp, i'll read pgns, ags and cmc, if you are ready to copy them, in that order, in local-vertical coordinates."

i can't catch you. okay.
"endeavour, this is houston. how do you read?"
"roger. i've - ron and i did some experimentation with that in the chamber, and couldn't agree more. but i sometimes don't remember it. thank you."

"oh, don't tell me. sounded like they hadn't researched that one this way. sounded like they'd researched it for the factors ... it's safe, you know, we aren't in ... - -"
"sounds like that's the_least of the sep's problem, but we have hope."
"okay, 17. what's out there in the distance on a hillside in the field of view of the camera? the camera is pointing at it."
yes.
"okay, which one is it, zpn or heart rate? over."
after all that instruction i got - - f-

okay. 10 07 53 49 lmi° okay.
"and, hank, how about if i put the pan c_,_era to - to power at the same time i take the image motion up, so i can have a couple extra seconds to look at the landing area."
"okay; houston, 15."
okay. and just to ease your mind on that other note - flight plan note - we're gonna - the mapping camera will be left out during your dump and the sleep period. 05 09 h7 07 cmp okay. 05 09 h7 12 cc okay. and 132 hours.

"roger, john. and would you reread the noun 33?"
god damn! dropped it on the floor. lord a'mighty.
what kind of mag?
all righty; we'll do all those.

charlie cut you out.
"okay. i'll go ahead and pack up, charlie."
better put some chewing gum on it; maybe some tape. that's what we need. put some tape around it. that will keep it from backing off.
"go ahead, houston."
"roger. stand by. oh 19 40 24 cc okay, jim. we'd like you to leave it in the con- figuration you found it in for a few minutes, because that will allow us to verify that that's where the leak was. over."

okay. (tranq )
what's that?
"apollo 11, houston. we're doing a nonprop_alsive vent on the booster at the present tir,e. you may see some sort of a cloud coming out of it. when you're ready, i have your evasiw maneuver pad. 00 03 50 44 cdf roger, and it's coring out."
okay. let's look over this mother. see if we missed anything.
did you get it?
roger.
look our your side window (laughter). l0 04 22 43 cml° stand by for 0.05g.

does oboe look good?
"okay, and that's in bag number 9."

"okay, tony. it's a white matrix in this rock with some clasts - it's a one-rock breccia. one of the clasts just fell out. but it really looks like a caliche matrix. sort of friable."
how are those binoculars working out?
whoa there.
"stand by for an answer on that, jim. and in the meantime, we have a truly magnificent view of the two of you here."
i can't hardly read it.
you nervous?
they think the lcru failed last night.
i'll have to go back to the backroom on that. apollo 17 air-to-ground voice transcription
roger. my frame count is 142.
"roger, d.r. we're thinking that that src is not closed very well. we're wondering if it'll go on the lec properly."
"just waiting for you. _f jo 0h ih 18 _p-eva hey, john, let me cap this - let me cap this little beauty here before we lose it - before i forger about it. yeah, i'm coming with the scoop. what else do you need?"
"okay, great."
okay. i'm going to go to reset again; will that be all right?
"but, so far, lm looks very clean. can't see _y- thing abnormal from this view yet."

"well, i'm glad you guys down there can figure all this out."
or that was - stand by.
ems is counting.
three minutes. det is good.
okay. i'm getting close.
yeah.
okay. and how about our readout on the battery and that charger?
"i got a chance to go back and look at the tele- scope on one of the last two revs, and found out the problem was that even after i had gone back and taped the eyepieces back on, they still had the tape on them, but the darned things had slipped out of focus with the telescope. and i guess it was far enough out of focus that it - the stars just weren't bright enough to show up. because while i was sitting there looking in it i could focus it and then the stars would appear and disappear if i defocused it. so i refocused the eyepiece and the telescope works like you'd expect a telescope to work."
"golly, that's a -"
"okay, the lm/cm delta-p doesn't look exactly right to us. what do you think? 07 09 2b 49 cc stand by. 07 09 24 b2 cc 15, houston. we'd like to get another pound out of there. we're showing about 3.5 in there."
it's a beauty.
"okay, that looks good."
"well, i don't know."
roger.
the only other thing that bothers me is that engine command in thrust. that is the one - doesn't it usually keep reading 10 percent all the time in the simulator?
(laughter)
roger. 09018.
"say again tony, you cut out after - all after ""what we':re searching for."""
"okay. we'll give it a try again, i did a 1-£oo_- i per-second radial in towards the moon. oh 06 52 29 cc and, kef; in addition to the pads, i also have you los an! aos time. 02 06 52 45 c_p okay. 04 06 53 _7 cc casper, houston. how do you read?"
"i think - we actually even commented wiienwe hi_, the breaking slope coming back ou_ of staaion 6 and 7, and then back off as - coming back do_ at 8 - how the terrain features ch_mged, i shink that was due principally to the - to the - what we've been calling the subfioor material evident. and there again, it was, what i would say_ par- _icularly mantled, filleted, _dch like we nave here where the lm is, with the excepsion of v_ serg, where we actually saw fragmental bo_iders for the most part, a lot less b_ied sit_ing on the surface."
okay. verify gpi returns to zero. 03 15_44 o1 cmp zero.
"okay; and - and break in and tell me as soon as you get the ds - get ready to dump the dse, so you can take a look at what i'm talking about, and i'll leave the antenna manual and wide so you can. okay; the text is that we came up to the burn time and i was going through the gimbal checks. number 1 servo started normally, checked out. i switched to - clockwise on the thc to perform the secondary gimbal check and started them. they looked normal. i set the pitch trim normally, and i went to set the yaw trim. i've just been checking to see if the lock worked, and i got divergent oscillations on the yaw trim indicator, and you could feel them in the spacecraft. so i switched to the - servo power to the number 2 servo to ac1/main a, tried that. that had no effect. then i cycled through looking at - at the gimbal - with the auto ... switch in number l, number 2 in auto. every time i selected number 2, by some means, i had the same results. then i tried scs in auto, and as soon as i would excite some motion in the secondary yaw servo, why, it would go unstable again. i then tried using the g&n to drive the gimbal, and i did the first half of the gimbal drive in servo loop l, then switched to the servo loop 2 for the second half, and again the same instability showed up. based on the rule of four servo loops, i can- celed circ. i had no other indications in the cockpit, no warning lights, no - no other abnor- malities. the ... was, in fact, running, but i don't think that could have had any effect when scs was going."
get your pan?
"roger, jack. any more master alarms? imp we had one when ron's - looked like his neck ring hit panel 2...."
okay.
"okay, joe. at 57:45, understand you want the ""s-band aux, tv to science."" then i missed the information after - after that, and then, finally, --_ the last one was ""s-band aux, tv to off."""
okay.

i'll give you a mark at 13 seconds.
"hey! how did you ever get l-2 closed, al?"
okay.

okay. that's a good readback.
put the optics away ....
"okay, vance. we're ready to go."
"well, now we know."
it is.
"very good, falcon. and any time you're interested in any lunchtime conversation, we've got more than enough to fill the square down here."
"okay, hank, is 5 degrees sufficient to cover all your bits?"
that's affirmative.
right.
okay. i'm maneuvering now.
are we about 5000 miles closer now?

we got it.

... you might give us a frame count on hotel.
"how about a cocoa, ken? 07 22 04 45 cml° that'll be okay. i'd like to have a juice, too, though."
got to be in mode 2 or something. i got it. what was that?
"got a bag? bag 568 is a fragment from the surface. that's a corner, i think, off the block that gene documented here."
okay.

okay.
"the covering on the - on the service module, if it hadn't been covered, boy, that would have been burned and scarred and scorched and everything else."

you're readable but noisy.
"yes, there's high-water marks all over that - that - i think that's maraldi there, isn't it? are you sure we're at 13 miles up?"
"stu, could you see us without the light? i'll turn it off."
"negative. the step above for cm free was command module, but the comm is for lm again."
"okay. philosophically speaking, i would like to get all these changes in before one or the other of us puts on a pressure suit because - because the - we're in an - energy conservation mode of operation, and i'd like to keep it that way."
"these, we'll just forget about and stick them back. i don't know what they are."
"okay, i'm going to park right here. and if you get bored, there's a big chunk of dark gray breccia with white clast right in front of the left wheel. have fun looking at that, maybe."
"okay. 06 21 bb 02 cc okay, the first one is at 180:20. add ""poo,"" and below it, add verb 49 maueuver to p52/trim attitude."""
the scoop is on the extension handle. different extension handle's of course.

let me get over there.
"okay. al, get the data there."
does it make any difference with the plus or minus roll there with the - now that you are going to use the high gain?
... really want ...
and endeavour roger. thank you. 04 05 45 -- begin lunar rev 13
how did he do on the landmark tracking? ask him.
"okay, ron, you might want to look at your flight plan when you get a chance. we're coming up on a sim bay reconfiguration here shortly."
"roger. we'll check this uplink on our voice. that transmission on the tv was - we'd like to get about 10 minutes worth of signal at gold- stone so we can look at the camera quality back here at houston for about 10 minutes or so when they patch it back into us. what we were saying was that you can go interior or exterior on the camera. on the exterior shots, we'd like to look - -"
*** enough.
"negative, jack."
couple minutes away.
"now wait a minute. okay. i'll push the top one, you push the bottom one."
okay. how's that?
"and, aquarius; houston. i've got some circuit breakers you can open to power down displays. in addition, i have a p30 maneuver pad. over."
it looks lighter to me. t
"well, that was almost right."
"okay, we may lose you a little early due to the sim bay attitude and we'll pick you up at 97:22."
"jack, we want battery 3 off for preconditioning."
"oh, yeah. 06 02 40 08 i_4°-eva i definitely think - about - this is fine here. get on up a little bit on the - that full throttle?"
"- - hey, hey, yes. let's get it at - -"
"okay. about all we have to do is to send up your state vectors and target loads, and that will have to wait a couple of minutes until we get ready to do so. and if you're ready to copy, i can give you the p30 maneuver pad for pc plus 2, and after that, probably you should eat and then we'll regroup again to send up other things. over."
"see a preamps, and i see ecs."
"okay, 17, for your planning -"
"oh, not too - not too hard. watch that turn."
"houston, z did that, and i believe we are flowing oxygen, but the gage is just pegged full scale low."
"okay; that's a retract to 16 feet, and that's 12 seconds from the existing position."
yes. let me get this thing set again.
roger that.
"dave, that's not required. go ahead and bypass that, please."
"i can sure feel the heat, though, on my hands. come out of there, rascal."

"outstanding! outstanding! this whole thing will come out here in a minute. it,_p-eva *** it. i'll watch it. got it?"
"looks like - although the blue-grsy up on the hill - looked like a fragment breccia, if this is still related, then it's - been some partial melting at some time."
"0kay, 17 - -"
"and, houston, we'll go ahead and maneuver onto the lm attitude."
"okay, we copy. 104 05 01 20 cmp i show about full, but i guess it isn't."
okay.
"okay, jack. the three comments are: assumes burn undocked. assumes no circ burn. and the moon at tig, the longitude'il be minus 1_0.19 de- grees. over. irp okay. i got everything but number 2. all right, here's your readback. tei-12, 12, that is; sps/g&n; 38570; plus 0._9, plus 0.92; 111:5_:_2.86_ plus 25_3.8, minus 1765.6, minus 0795.0. 186, 109, 328. sirius and - rest of the pad is na. sirius and rigel; 133, 200, 030. ullage is four jets for 12 seconds. remarks: 1, burn undocked; 2, assume no circ; 3, longitude - lunar longitude at tig, minus 1_0.19 degrees, .19 degrees."

outstandingl
okay. go ahead.
"yes .... the first time, you know, you said was after the first burn was because, hell, that ... never came down."
wipe you right out.
"if you don't have any voice at aos, wait 30 sec- onds, check the high gain antenna, watch 0_]_ib, watch secondary transponder; after 3 rains, go to loss-of-comm cue card."
"okay, that's close enough."
"unfortunately, it's smaller than the metal holder. kind of interesting."
how about this? you need that one?
okay. closed - closed - open - open - closed - open - open. they're all okay.
you want this?
"and, a1 and ed. i don't - yes. i don't think you have to worry too much about the exact position of site b. if you're - it appears you're getting close to the general area, that should be good enough on"
what happens to it if you don't pull those breakers? run off somewhere?
"okay, bag 27-nancy. and another documented sample - -"
i'm going to slow down here.
"boy, that's neat."
"houston, apollo 15."
....
"no, i got it here. i've got a delicate core in one hand, and i'm trying to get some core caps in the other. you'd be glad to know it's full, bob. and while i'm the only one to see the bottom end right now, i'm going to tell you, it - it looks like - it looks like what i'm walking on, but it's obviously now powdery. it's obviously very - very cohesive, because it - it - the bottom of the core is not smooth, it's very jaggedy, and fragmental-like."
"1_0, gear down and locked."
i'll give you a call.
"okay, stereo it is. 08 05 18 28 c_4p and pan camera to standby."
"okay. we'd like to get a flight plan update from you for the next couple of hours, here. when you think what the various constraints might be and what - what order you might like us to do things."
"yes, we're in track, auto."
"and, houston, i'll guess we'll do this ptc in yaw, and do you want them all powered down?"
got a voice?
"okay. there we go. plus b56.95, plus 106.34, and a plus 001.49."
"and, dave, a - we - our telemetry says that the optics power is still on, and i'd like to remind you to turn it off."
roger. thank you very much.
okay.
pc's holding about 90 - 96.
"okay, got servo power. ac1 and ac2."
just about fell down. 05 03 43 04 ia_p-eva i not you. got it. two-man job.
roger.
yes. i was sure busy there for a couple of sec- onds.
roger; 261 plus 42.
"okay. you want to give me that other one back here, i'll see if i - trouble is, i got no hooks that are the right length apart for my goddamn ... fiddle with it. i'll just hang on to it tight and ..."
... at -
"okay, want to get these numbers, jim? i mean, tell me the elevation and so on."
"is that the time frame you - ? okay. that time frame was - i would guess it was about a minute, tony. because when i tapped it, i just couldn't get them to move. i had already - i had already tapped that thing once before, for the bubbles, and - because when - as soon as we unpacked it, we saw the bubbles out there, and i banged it a little bit to try and see if i could get them to move and didn't have any luck at alii. so we didn't wait any 3 or 5 minutes, it - it was about 2 min- utes, i guess."
"aquarius, you're go at 3 minutes."
go ahead.
okay.
"roger, colualbia. we copy. that's good, and _'d like a readout on the tep of about the time you - that eagle selected the secondary loop. over."
okay; let me get one parting shot of - one of the finest running little machines i've ever had the pleasure to drive.
see _at i'm doing?
"roger. good readback and up in that block if you didn't copy it there, that csm weight _ha_ - gave you before is 36032. cm_ yes, 36032. that's right. 07 15 49 13 c5_ okay, i guess you need a p52. _oinglngj ..."
"now, if the old antenna would come back in, we'd be in good shape, huh?"
okay. it must have taken about - 3 minutes.
"okay, understand you're ready. what - the first thing is an entry pad, so you might whip out your entry checklist."
circuit breaker.
"let's go up on the up - the upper rim up there, and work our way back up to our rover friend. separate, simultaneous communications link in use between cc and cm 05 23 06 -- begin lunar rev 34"
"hello, apollo 11. houston. would you dlease terminate battery charge now? over. 06 10 46 19 i3_p roger. terminating battery charge."
"okay, john. we've got very poor comm; we're going to drop the - drop the link for a minute here. we'll be back in a minute."
"right there .... 10. okay. i go on the other side. doesn't that look like a contact to you, jim?"
it's not working. there it goes. oh'
"aquarius, houston. request you open the power amplifier circuit breaker and down voice backup, please."
what's that gurgling?
"15, this is houston; we'd like to have omni charlie. 00 11 51 _3 cmp houston, 15. say again your last."
"okay, midpac; roll 0, pitch 153, yaw o; 290:06:32, 267; minus 00.71, minus 156.15; 0.69 - 06.9; plus 36196, minus 006.5; plus 1045.8, plus 36276; 290:23:32; 00:27; na on noun 69; do 4.00, v - vcirc time 2:02; 00:16, 03:33, 07:23; 25, 151.5, 26.2; na; lift vector up. nonexit ems pattern; ret 9ok, 06 plus 06; main 08 plus 29; landing 13 plus 21; constant-g entry, roll right; moonset, 290:20:26; ems entry, reverse bank at 20k feet per second."
"oh, rats."
need to ge_ the whole thing.
"that's a good plan, ken, and the - where we are going to pick up the flight plan again is at 168:30, to start preparing for rendezvous, and from 168:30 on to 175 hours, if you add 4 hours to all of those times, they're close enough that we can use them all the way through the rendezvous."
stand by.
the first thing you got to do is ...
yes. i - i just freak. that's me - i freaked up. i should have left you alone over there and stayed on my own business. my fault.
"roger, ron. good readback. i've got a dap weight for one man for the csm, if you want to copy it somewhere. fao would like to get the maneuver started, ron. go ahead, and i'll give it - -"
"keep going. okay, there's a double one."
okay.
"let's see. if you're going to do that, hand me the checklist - -"
"okay, the first one there that you just read back was at 197:03; and at 197:05, we have ""configure camera for orbital science, co_mand module 5/el/250/cex intervalometer f/8, 1,/250, infinity, 128 frames, magazine romeo romeo."" 08 0_ 48 30 c_ don, you gonna give me some words on what that target is? 08 04 _8 35 cc stand by 1. i'll get you that."
copy that.
"okay, fine."
okay; and you're clear on spiral.
"yes, it is. didn't we do it - -"
because i don't believe we're gonna make it through this list before reentry.
roger. we did not break down the suits; we're still locked up.
"well, i haven't been to the place where i could see that and look down on it. but during our first rev - after do - no - yeah. the first rev after doi, we passed right abeam of that guy and i got you a nice oblique shot of it from what looked like it was right next door. and it's got very sharp rims on it. it 's _ it 's got dark material around it, on the inside and the outside, and i guess it's draped. but it looked to me like it was a, you know, a very sharp feature. it had all the appearances of a - what you would think of as a fresh strata volcano would look like as a little bitty guy. and the white stuff looks like snow on it."
"they're sort of dirty. -- separate, simb_taneous co_unications link in use between cc and cm"
two more marks and i'll get a look at a solution for you.
"tranquility base, tranquility base, this is houston. radio check. over."
"and i'll turn the switch to off, if you want."
...
okay; fine°
mag metro.
yes.
"okay, houston, did you get the ags cal numbers?"
verified to standby.
- - an eighth of an inch or so.
"okay. on second thought, maybe it's not big enough. i'll just - -"
i have a tone at this time.
what are you doing to ... here?
(laughter) 07 14 14 59 imp i feel like ... on top of ... any man who could do that ... i don't understand ... this stuff and ... one on top of the other and then shake them up ...
"well, i don't like to try things that there is a probability of failure on - if you can - you're just going to lose some time. okay; mag nancy in on the lmp's camera. *** you can see the rock population here *** but we can try it."
"ken, we're gonna need that vacuum cleaner something bad."
"okay, john, you're go for egress. charlie, we'd like - -"
"maybe you need a scroll, yet."
okay.
"yes, it did, as a matter of fact. and, i forgot to look and see if it is still red."
"al, i think we've run out of ideas here for the present time. let's press on. will you take the camera over and put it in the lm shade, point it at a darkspot, the darkest spot you can find, and open the camera way up, f:2.27"
"okay. and, john, when you get inside, we have a configuration change in lrv."
i - i've got to go right. i got to go right.
"roger. you have it. and readback tei-19, sps/g&n; 394h5; plus 0.61, 1.15; 111:31:49.81; plus, 2909.4, plus 0785.3, minus 0224.0; 181, 100, 017. sirius and rigel; two jets, 17 seconds; burn undock, assume eirc; lm to at t. minus 166.09. lg"
yes. you can see it's blue-gray because of its contrast with the lig_htmantle.
"let's see, intervalometer's down there, jim, in the - let's see - it's in the camera - it's right in front of the camera compartment."
"ail right, sir."
"look at him out there ahead. o0 01 28 54 imvfp look. yeah, way ahead."
maybe i can - -
- - reset.
that's a smart idea.
... okay.
"yeah, that's a two-rock breccia. let me get a bigger piece of it, charlie. 06 02 l0 37 i2_p-eva i think - okay, i don't know whe - you can't whack it off."
"okay, cabin repress valve to close. 06 19 17 02 i24p cabin repress going closed - now. 06 i9 17 06 cdr okay. and the over - the forwarc aump valve open then auto at 3 and 1/2. 06 19 17 13 i2v_ okay, stand by."
"real fine. 04 14 o0 06 cm_° also, houston, ! lost the landmark at 24:01 instead of 24:19."
okay.
"okay. i - i kept watching it since we've set it. we haven't touched that thing now for a long time, and maybe i just haven't caught any of the extremes, but it looks like it's been holding nicely between about 45 and 50."
we should have briefed for just that.
yes; along the xx axis of the spacecraft.
smooth - -
"let's go, babe."
cross-sun on it. normal cross-sun.
yes. that's why you - that's why you loaded - -
very good.
three degrees on the gdc at 2 hours.
it's did with the purge. 03 04 31 18 cml° oh. all right. okay· okay. this is off.
"and on another check there, inco verified there was no problem with your configuration."
oh.
okay.
[roger. it looks good.
i think we lost them.
"okay, we're moving along pretty well, fred, at this point. and i'd.say we're still probably about l0 minutes away from weird."
yes.
go ahead.
okay.
"2,5. and what's your cuff gage? 05 22 15 50 i/_p-lm ... 5.1."
"take another look at the polar plot here for - okay, looks like it's about 29 degrees - and 37 miles. 07 04 19 03 cd_ now we're drifting in just a little bit - little bit low, but - nothing to have concern about."
"it's on panel 229 over there, charlie. it's ... - -"
good show.
"roger, america. we're standing by."
"you wrote it down, pete. you wrote it down on that other page. but, hell, what difference does it make? it's right - in a minute. we're going to see them come up."
"ken, give us high gain, auto."
okay.
... high - a little bit high on the ball - up about i degree.
"that ain't very smart. well, i'm sorry about that."
"roger. be advised your command module pilot, alfredo, just did a perfect plane change burn."
"oh, i suggest - - 03 17 19 30 _ ... better get going."
0ops - okay?
we see you going around the corner here and you're looking good as you go by us.
"roger, pete. we'll be waiting for those pictures."
"okay, fine. 05 05 5li48 cdr-eva because it's reloading. boy."
"4 jets. ' lmp att control, three, in pulse."
"roger. understand. did dave reed get to ex- plain the lunar ... at the _,e_s conference?"
"yes, we copied your vi and your ems numbers, and we've got a number for you. maneuver start time will be at 03 plus 3b plus 27. latp okay, we got you. maneuver at 03:33:27."
okay. stand by. i'll get it. okay. go ahead.
"okay. canopus. canopus. okay, take me to canopus."
"well, it's stained by the glass coating."
275 and 66. ail righty.
04076.
"can you see this, charlie? on the monitor?"
roger. we copy.
"okay, b-tamer is on."
"yeah, we're ready."
... - -
"oh, okay. we thank you much."
take a look in there. the condenser's normal ....
copy.
yes. how about that?
"roger. stand by just about 30 seconds, and we'll come up with a couple."
- - first glance that that heading is still a good heading. we'll be back with you.
we're probably gonna break lock. with all of this z.
"pure glass or something, huh?"
"okay, houston; apollo 17. first one would be 015:00, a delta-v of 3893, minus 174, and get400k is 057:56. the other one is t. of 025:00, lg delta-v of 6651, longitude of minus 175, get of 400k is 057:25."
roger.
"john, i can't budge mine either. i don't know how big of a screwdriver the guy had, but he must of had a monster .... can't even come close to it. 08 00 18 b6 lmp well, guess what."
"hello, houston; this is 15. loud and clear, and i got your first message, karl. sorry. l0 05 1y 45 cc ..., al. we've got some sort of problem on the ground circuits here .... in contact with you."
the head - oh - i see it. yes. you mean the great big one over here? okay. yes. we can go over there.
"okay. go ahead and pull it out, and i'll -"
roger. we copy. mighty fine.
"that's 3.0, 3.5, 3.7."
go ahead.
i got it.
"okay, geno. that sounds good."
... up ...
you know one of the things we need in this program is some o:_.topuses.
"okay, 14 ... hey?"
how do you read lookout octal? verb 04? okay; let's look at it and see what it is.
"roger. copy, eagle. (goss net 1) tape 54/3"
"ed bat's are go, houston."
yes. and i'll stick it right down here in case we need it. okay.
"okay, well, we need to get that hig old pan camera. (humming) oops."
"as soon as the sun gets back over our head, here, which would fill up - shining down in our window - ah! i see him, now."
"you are, hank. we're just teasing. l0 o0 02 h8 cdr looks like h9 to me."
"i want to put another fi_r_m_© on an_ ge_ m_e of stuart than i've got left on this one. i've got a ca,ch of empty _iags. 05 22 48 08 lr_ 84."
"oh, yeah?"
"okay, there's the ma [?] caution light. s t_pe 93/8"
"okay, and then add that line down further on the page where it says ""stow in etb"" add ""l - hcex mag b."" 05 10 26 29 lmp-_ okay. copy."
you don't have a bleed on yours. hit your - hit your disconnect.
"okay. well, actually, there's a bubble in each tube."
not yet. you got some fenders and stuff for me - -
"ham_.er to left seat. l_,_ ur_load - okay, we're both unloaded. pack the etb. wait a minute. i should be doing it. 06 05 34 21 l_p-eva i've got it in my checklist, too. that's something. ]6 05 3l 29 cdr-eva okay, now you're going to have to - going to have to change that some because we got a li_t!e more than two htc back. 06 05 3x 41 lmp-eva john, could you get those _oodies in the left seat bag there in my b_g '_t_dpass them over? 06 05 3h 49 cdr-eva okay."
...
"apollo 13, houston. are you reading me now?"
okay.
... looking good ... there.
i covered the recovery area. not the rest of the pacific. did you want an overall briefing?
"fred, houston. we'll have to stand by for 1 minute. we are in a noisy state of comm."
okay ....
"okay. we made a little money, didn't we?"
roger. go ahead. (tranq)
"okay. that's the one. oh, there it is. i'm looking on the wrong page. age confidential da6y 05 23 07 25 ln_ okay."
it's funny to see this big machine doing like this - look out the window and see it roll. haven't been near a body in so long.
okay. reading you loud and clear also.
yes.
rover - rover warning was up.
"okay; and be advised, we also tried to get it to panel 162 without success. it was too short for that one, too."
i was dumbhead for letting that son of a bitch overspeed_ wasn't i?
"you have to do that with the telescope, hank."
"i guess if you saw a crater or s_nething, you might look at that, but primarily we're looking at the crater."
"and you can - you can hang onto a pretty well. b - b, just - i just didn't find long enough to give a good - a good impression on that one - on that one. i guess, overall, i'd rate it - at -"
"suit gas diverter, egress?"
"ascent and rendezvous, babe."
there you go. that's a good idea; go ahead and do that.
"roger, gene."
okay.
your diverter - it's min.
"roger, pete and al_ we copy. we suggest you start smoking on back there. you're 3:13, and i'd like you back there in 4 minutes."
"go ahead, houston."
"bend over good, here. okay. whew. that bag is all folded up so much, i can't get to it. now you can get my antenna."
"challenger, houston. it's your computer, now."
"okay, thank you."
"man, i think that was it."
stand by 1.
you're in .max.
"mark. young - and in the upper right eye, a couple of streaks from - looked like they were going from left to right - out at - about 2 o'clock out."
"hey, charlie. we're having a hard time getting - -"
actifed.
i'm afraid you're right.
you out completely?
okay.
there's nothing wrong with that except that - lmp-eya i think we ought to go back to that big block.
"endeavour, this is houston. how do you read?"
"okay, i'd go now if - -"
oh. do you think that's camelot or not?
this way?
"... in mode iv. 00 00 09 54 c_ at 101.5, i'll - okay. we have 100, 25, 5; 77, 25, 5; 15. okay. 256 60."
very good. i've got it.
"boy, i thought i had a lunar rock there, it's a piece of bread,"
"columbia, this is houston. over."
open.
it's out in the middle of ...
"okay, is that 49 degrees the coldest temperature? or just how did you -"
let me get it. i'll get it - i'll get it under your electrical cable.
"okay. let's get on with *** list. 04 08 44 o0 cbr hey, i'm back on ics/ptt, jim."
"okay, h2 fan 2 is going off and 3 to auto. and this is truly a historic event."
what a bunch of bull.
okay.
"*** a/c. okay, leave the b/c [sic] roll jets off. just leave enable coupled. yes, sir. just turn - turn the a/c roll on. okay; and all of the pitch and yaw. push the three, maybe, or four, maybe, circuit breakers back in. okay. okay, you're in business. you have the auto coiled? [?]"
...
pitching over.
i'm not putting any - i'm not putting any force on it. i'm letting it do it - its own forcing.
quite a scene up here. got your pictures? pictures?
"seventy miles out, john. get on the chart at 25 degrees. seventy miles and 25 degrees. we're right on the line. golly, what is that? want some tears?"
you want to set your - check your verb 54?
roger.
"just of interest to you, ron. we are really pleased with the way that our visual display and that worked out last night during the orbital science visual. farouk was able to feed me the questions, and i was able to get them to you. if you have any comments one way or another, if you don't want us to do it on rev 40 or not, let us know. we plan right now on rev 40 for those orbital science visuals to do the same thing going - it's the visuals through landing site down through d-caldera, and we're going to run the same operation, since it went so smoothly down here. we hope it went that way for you up there."
"hey, houston; america."
...
"i have a feeling you've got a couple left over, don't you?"
that's it.
"that's correct. that will not, however, get you into the - into the problem that causes the plat- form to go into coarse align. and also, we were advised that while this emp is in, you shouldn't have the problem with losing the platform alignment."
"roger, gene. we copy that. i4_p-iam joe, that des -"

(laughter) you say the world looked _retty good when it went by?
"yeah, full moon."
lmp - lmp is go.
"okay. we should be straightened out now, charlie, and back in po0."
that's a big book with a lot of just plain old blank pages in it.
"roger, ken. the only thing scheduled is _hat p52 asout an hour from now."
"bye - yes, sir."
okay.
"too bad i don't have my skiis. r cdr-eva jack, did you get a pan up here?"
"okay, and we'd like to insert underneath that line ""circuit breaker panel 16, inverter 2, close, and invei_ter switch to 2."""
never mind; we got it.
"okay, that sounds great, deke. it won't - we're just cleaning up a few minor things _d we'll actually probably be asleep in the next 10 to 15 minutes."
okay. - -
how you like the propellant position?
- - about 5 minutes to meet the walkback constraints.
yes. it's pointed down towards south ray.
okay.
"right, gordo."
"okay, dave. we're just seeing a little rise in partial pressure c02. that's the - the reason we asked the question. we'll watch it."
okay. could you give us auto on the high gain?
"challenger, houston. you're stay for t-2, and go for the dps vent."
can't see that far. stand by.
mark.
roger; that's correct.
"pete and al, we're back with you."
"you ready for the next one, ken?"
"that's verified, ken."
best of the receive only? okay.
"understand you want deploy for 20 seconds and then - on the mass spec boom, and then retract until we get gray for 40 seconds. _ 11 11 56 44 cc roger. whichever occurs first."
"okay. set delta-v c ..., john."
"boy, you feel that 'guy moving."
"okay, drill's out of the mesa."
plss pump on. (tranq)
he's over there - - l0 04 34 31 r - - he's hit the clouds. i'm on the way down- -
"yes, that's going to take an awful lot. because --- we're a fair ways out now, and we'll have to maneuver quite a ways to get behind him. it'll take quite a while and a little bit of gas."
- - are you working on the outside of the crater or are you - -
now it's just - (laughter) - they must have doubled the cable length on this ones
"- - south. oh 01 !_ ih l_p-lm okay, does that mean that we're _oing to _e - at pitchover, we'll be steering from south to north? %_ 51 13 2i cc that's affirmative. 04 01 !3 25 cdr-i24 okay, so at pitchover, we'll be - you'll be tar- geting us right into the target, but we'll be steering from south to north. is that based on ken's tracking?"
"i'm coming up to it now. thank you. going to standby, and image motion, off, and it's barber pole - and gray. and here comes the g,m_a ray shield. shield is off now."
okay. see you later. and tell jim that deke wants him to go to bed.
yes.
"man, that's the way to come downhill."
yes.
"dave, before you move out, you want to doublecheck your heading 'at 292."
roger.
get that down good over - -
they're off.
"*** the ullage. standing by for ullage. *** sec- onds. *** ullage. we've got ullage. proceed on the 99. it took. 2, l, 0 -"
- - on time. 111:57:30.09.
"houston, this is 15."
okay.
"go ahead, go ahead with your description. we're listening."
"it should go out - out directly. oh 23 15 37 cc guys, it looks okay. it's the water sep light."
mark.
some of them have -

"ron, did you get the pan camera to t-stop?"
don't we have to recycle that suit flow deal to get that - whole thing?
right.
"okay, i - we're - -"
roger. and your ratea are low. looks like you can start the ptc.
"okay. mine, too. eva station pressure gage 100 to 500. no tone."
a-2 is as you have listed.
verified. reading - 25.
"it's norm-lly quite fast. ... at 54 minutes, we want to be at 25 degrees. 00 o2 43 11 aa ... 00 02 43 36 aa ..."
believe that's where we just came from.
"okay. 04 l0 43 42 cdr-iam partially open the over - head hatch. 04 l0 43 47 in_p-i_ okay, i'll read to you. 04 l0 43 48 cdr-imm okay, go. 04 l0 43 51 lmp-i_m partially open the overhead hatch."
yes.
"roger, jim; and that might very well be earthlight at i o'clock. and domingo crater should be on your left, now."
okay. looks good.
"oh, i wouldn't do that to you this early in the morning."
"america, houston. we're ready for verb 74."
"a is egress, and b, direct 02 ."
"15, this is houston. your rates look low enough to go into spinup, if all of your vents have been closed."
it must be in my ...
"oh, okay."
"okay, jack. we copy. we're wondering if you could come up with a quantitative estimate on the water you've each drunk - drunk and also your prd readings. lmp-i_ stand by, gordy. that may be difficult. yes, we'll get the prd a little bit later when we start suiting up."
...
"ascent helium press, fire, tank 1."
"houston, 15. go ahead."
"oh, yeah, i made it, but i had to - you know, i had to work at it. but it's a - we were - i was worried about it getting down as towards mila there after - you know if we had to scrub and go tomorrow night. boy, i'm sure glad we got you off tonight."
down there. right there. that's it.
don't run out.
"okay, your power is up to 4, tony; i mean your s-band agc is to 4 and you're external. i - it was off, i'm sorry."
"and you're thinking correctly, jim - -"
okay. there you go. 06 21 13 51 lmp-i2{ get the click?
"hey, casper, this is orioa. houston, you said vhf a to transmit, b to receive, right?"
"- - is that what you're talking about, volcan - - 06 23 55 13 i2_p-eva i'll take the bags. can you get them out - -"
"and, bob, about - about 200 meters back, we crossed back into our standard mantle surface of about 1-percent fragment cover. it's the block field - -"
"hello, falcon. this is houston. just for your own information, the water separator number 1 looks good. but we'll he keeping a further eye on it here. a little later on, gordo's going to read up a pro- cedure that involves the vhf communications check."
i don't think dusting the battery covers gives us any cooler batteries.
"and in the meantime, i can put in another little old sponge. got to keep the surgeons happy. besides - besides it feels better to change them anyhow. there's the spot. 0_ 15 11 01 cmp okay, you ought to be getting good data now."
copy that. li_'_?-eva ...
"okay. here we go. -- separate, simultaneous communications link in use between cc and cm 05 23 13 xx begin lunar rev 36"
"okay, torqued at 29:30."
"bob, let me give you some readings, so i can get going."
"hey, charlie, have you got a forward vhf there?"
is that in the right place?
"roger, ron. i have a couple pan camera photo pads for you."
yeah. it's so it won't get scratched ...
"roger, ken. go ahead and torque."
... jim ...
"beautiful. seven to nothing, huh? go get 'em, cowboys."
"bob, a little more about wake and the marshalls and kwajalein. that large pattern of what appear to be broken to overcast clouds in a - a clockwise circulation pattern - crosses the equator region now that i've tried to project that through."
chamber pressure's at 98.
huh?
okay.
enter.
"that's a good plan. i'll try to have them for you in a couple of minutes. and_ for orion, i have the lm deorbit pad. 08 01 20 56 c_ okay, he'll be with you in just a second, hank. he's halfway in a suitwork."
thank you.
"you don't have a cold something or other, do you?"
"okay. delete ""auto rcs select, 16, off."" change ""cb logic power"" to ""logic thrust power - cbs cs logic thrust, four, to closed."" delete ""delta-v cg,"" coming down here ""signal conditioner/driver bias power, one, ac 1; bmag power, 1, to on,"" and it's the number 1 t_mag. ""fdai power to 1; bmag mode, three, to rate 1,"" deleting the ""auto rcs select, 16, to enable."""
there you go.
okay.
"yes. i was kind of lucky, i guess."
okay - -
"we copy those, jim_ thank you. and normally, i guess, we'd like those in the postsleep period as opposed to presleep, which is when we got them -_ yesterday. i guess it's in the checklist that way 02 01 28 00 _ okay, we'll - okay, we'll normally do it that way."
and you tell vance i got cartoons on right now.
...
"hey, ken. if they let us go, boy, i'll tell you, if you ask me, you ought to just forget about that mep - emp thing, and just leave the gimbal motors on those 6 minutes."
"no, i don't either."
yes. now we can just sit here. you've got omni b here or 0mni charlie in that other attitude.
okay. you give me the time. i'll get the ullage.
"that's it, yes. *** swing over so i can lean on the rover when i put the - -"
"bob, we're still on november november frame 140, and i'm going to take two more pictures before i go to sleep."
"no, no, i'll get it."
probably.
"lie it on the floor, here."
that's right - -
"hey, houston, 13."
roger. 08 08 50 15 cml_ i just can't get these new guys away from the windows.
"question number 8 for dave scott. the drill seemed to drive you up the crater walls. what was the problem, and was it worth the time?"
ail right.
okay. i'll get a new prog in and compare your estimage there.
let's have a sandwich.
"yes, i doubt if they will be blooming even saturday, when you return."
roger. out. ' 04 20 07 37 lmp - - current reading is 8.
"bey, there we go."
"stand by. we'll check them, jim."
"i've come up with nothing here. 02 16 54 47 i,mp ... we can use."
"15, this is houston. the noise was very bad then; are you reading me?"
"say again which strut, buzz?"
"hey, we're getting them. how about that. yes. there, got a lock."
"yes, it looks pretty big, but i think it's probably going to be small."
no.
we're coming to look right up your bell.
"we'll run through it, jack, if you could - 00 00 42 10 cml° ..."
okay.
"cabin repress valve, close."
would you believe that tli is at - at 2 - time base 6 is what? 02:36?
"let's get a better heading here from 22 to 195, houston."
*** sit here and really rest awhile.
"take a picture in here, jack. i_fp-eva no. locke, i can see -"
okay.
"okay, - my - turn around. your hook's up, but i'm not sure i closed your - your other one. take a look at it. yes, it's all closed. okay, you're good. there you go."
"okay. well, tell me what that thing on page 2- whatchacall it says, charlie."
"i tell you, when you go to get on this thing, you better turn your cooling down or you'll freeze."
"okay, houston, 15. we're ready for the e-memory dump for you, if you're ready."
need some help?
okay.
did you find it?
"that sounds great, jack."
"yes. jack, try a little higher. see that one right on the - right there. right -"
okay.
"*** check mine, too, that's it. i'm going to have to check you anyway. let me turn this way."
excellent.
...
"the rake and the scoop are back on. okay, get the charge. i'll set the low gain, and we'll be - ready to do it."
emb and g&n agree.
"okay, how about a little squirt? man, this lcg pump cooling is the best thing they ever built."
affirmative.
"yes, it's time to turn the recorder on."
okay. i have a couple of comm procedures for you - -
"two, and the hook's still hooked. check for sure. those hooks weren't designed for new bags."
that's verified.
...
"okay, give us a start and stop."
"in other words, was there a change ra - radially outward from eorth ray?"
"oh, yes, there it is. yes, you're right. f"
"okay, baby! _ 12 43 _2 {:th ckay, i got it. c5 12 43 22 [mp almost turned, didn't it?"

"that's affirm. we'd like it out, and then bat 2 on the line."
"yes, i - ! was caught on the jettison bag. how's that? 04 23 51 32 l_ you're clearing the - it now. 04 23 51 35 lmf over a little to your - little to your left. down a little more - a little to your left."
"yes. crenulations, you might say, in the slope that look something like those i saw from orbit - looking in the shadowed area - at the edge of the shadows. bob, we've seen craters as much as - 20 meters, maybe 30 meters in diameter without blocky rims."
okay; load once .-verb 25? did you ever pro on that?
"okay, i want to go to dump and go down to 3.5 (tranq) and back to auto."
"roger. we copy. c_p okay. bob, if - would you give me a call when you get ready for that mapping camera stuff? i was kind of shoved off this morning, and i got to sample their buses."
okay. i'll be right with you.
"thank you, bob."
yeah.
like this. two-legged hop.
"yes. we'll have comp in another couple of min- utes. twenty-nine thou and - .- 05 22 55 32 cm? man, now that is a wild sight watching ... 05 22 55 44 l_? twenty-nine thou and 80 degrees - 80 degrees· and ... okay, we're bellying out just a little bit. say again, stu?"
roger.

okay. thank you for the education.
"no, sir. 04 06 17 27 _ houston, eagle. how do you read? (eagle)"
uv is on.
"okay, gordy, go with the ascent pad."
"okay. we're - we're not - we're not really ready to go to sleep yet, but we're just moving ahead."
"yeah, we've only lost one set - set of bags, charlie. okay. here we go. well, we've got a few left here."
okay; 354.6. okay; verb 60 enter.
"okay. there you go. unstow your boors, purge valve to purse, stow iv gloves in boot bottom compartment."
"no, it's a solid piece of glass."
- - ... - just a little bit -
"let me go over here; there's three in a row, and let's work this area a little bit, which is the corner of head crater they wanted us to work."
"okay. index is 24: 01731, 12560, 22624, 66315, 75546, 71001, 47526, 02044, 04020, 70164, 73753, 15651, 30651, 64233, 64471, 65647, 63433, 74021, 76063. over."
"okay, well, if we burn i foot per second on the local horizontal, which we are 81most on right now, i think that will put us in an orbit which re - remains clear from it."
"okay, ken, there they are; minus o, minus 0.1, minus o."
- - ...
"you know, we hardly kick up any dirt at all, charlie. just hardly any."
made a dent on this rock. whoops. wait a min- ute; i dropped it. hold it; move on a little bit. move on; move forward.
yes.
you read me?
"yes, i did."
o._ay. we're 9 and a half minutes from time base 6. 00 02 09 18 l_tp oi_ay.
"there you go; thats - see that's the t. at at cdh, 1.53. okay. lg"
go ahead.
"*** down there, okay?"
yeah.
"thought i'd just send y'all - got you back on the omnz - or correction, high gain now, hank. say how do you read?"
you weenie. i don't believe that.
okay; will do.
"yeah, i agree. like here is - is a little - a little crater right there that was - had uncovered some -"
"orion, houston's go."
roger.
we wanted decay for i minute.
okay. okay.
"okay. okay; low gain is set, and heading about 035 - oh, let me set this thing out of the way again. this has been giving me more trouble."
whoop. one thing about being on a 20-degree slope. you can get down on your knees.
"okay, jack. did you have - - 03 ]8 33 19 _c - - hey_ houston_ are you reading?"
"okay. did you get these cap dispensers - you don't need - we don't need those, do we?"
"that's verified .... for you, charlie."
how you doing?
"well, jack. this is going to be difficult."
i'm supposed to call you when i have it fueled.
"not yet. no. another 15 seconds. wait a minute; here we come. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1."
okay.
"stand by. 07 05 30 i_ cc casper's trying to call you now. and the con- figuration is on 7-12, on your checklist."
roger.

roger. we're ready.
"reg a is closed. gene, ::an you get .mywater?"
"man, i'm glad we're not going _or a long rendezvous today."
okay. we got it.
"yes. well, i made a mistake too. i thought eratosthenes was copernicus. but anyhow we got - we got a series on eratosthenes and also a series on copernicus. so we're in good shape."
hold it - to the logic. l0 04 30 22 cml° thirty k?
"and, jim, we'd like a stereo pan with your 70-millimeter camera. maybe now is a good time to get it. or wherever you think is just - -"
okay. i'm back to lunar bat - lmp lunar bat off/reset.
...
... antenna.
"sure. i'm sure we can, joe."
"no, i mean you got a couple abrasions right on through the - -"
i got it. lm2_-eva see the instant rock.
- - 2 - 3 - 4.
landing antenna to auto.
six - probably nothing. but tell us - -
how many?
"vox sens, max."
i'm glad somebody is watching things. thank you.
"yes, indeed. you're very well centered."
0.3? (laughter)
seems kind of strange ... 03 15 50 38 c_ep i mean that son of a bitch has been out for a long _ime. 03 15 50 _1 i2_p yes.
right.
"okay, if we can keep crown crater and that - there's a big one to the bottom, one down on the first terrace and then one on the second terrace. those three sort of - in a line, coming home_ we got it."
"oh, it was just - we wanted you to close the c02 sensor breaker and give us an rcs onboard readout out of eagle, but that's all. columbi:_ houston. we've got a state vector for you if you'll give us po0 in accept. over."
...
"there's one other frag down here that fell. about like that. let me get a couple of rounded ones here, too, that are just on the surface. i can't tell - can't tell what that is, but we'll put it in anyway, as representative of surface material - at least the fragmental surface. okay; why don't you zip that one? here let me zip it, and you can take the afterpicture, jim. 06 21 49 31 i_p-eva okay. to"
"okay. 07 01 01 35 t_mp-eva and the rim is - the rim here is cobbly. i wouldn't say it's blocky, but it's cobbly."
"okay. okay, command module rcs monitoring. talkback, gray."
"of course, we're start - we're starting to come up over the flatlands now, over the smyth sea. i remember a landmarking track down there on apollo 10. it's still there. you can't really tell by looking at it that the smyth sea is any - any deeper or lower than the data shows it is right in the surrounding terrain."
"roger, neil. one of the implications here is the depth from which the b_lk sample was collected. did you manage to get down there several inches or nearer the surface? over."
"yes. 05 23 33 26 cml° let me - let me clean up over here and i'll be with you. 05 23 33 29 limp he can shut his off. 05 23 33 30 cdr yes. okay, forward dump valve's auto."
roger. going to aft omni.
"roger. copy, dave. 06 00 04 56 _p-eva it just looks the same - just the ... here."
"okay; we'll cycle back, ed."
roger. the sleep restraint of the hammock is coming into view underneath the couch. it's the white object.
okay. you'll be at - -
"okay, bob, made two checks over a period of 100 seconds. one was minus 99.0 and the other was minus 98.9."
roger. 04 10 45 00 cml° okay. let's see if i can give you that thing now.
"apollo 11, this is houston. over."
"oh, i wouldn't think so, dave."
roger.
see?
"we had to do so much work around the - the rover, there's hardly a spot that's not - messed up."
"vhf a, t/r."
boy.
"... okay, we got to do some more switching, yet."
"okay, houston. we just transferred to csm power, and the caution warning light did go off."
okay.
"yes, i think they're - how does the - how do the pins look up there, jim? can you - see those?"
"go ahead, houston, eagle here."
...
... zero ... 03 04 58 5_ cn[p minus 2.4.
"okay. i got my toys put up now and i guess next thing in order is to copy a little plane change pad, huh?"
"okay. so, you let your umbilical flow bring every - the cabin up to 3."
"yes, they got it."
get your self a couple pictures while you're look- ing right at it. lb{p-eva could you swing right. swing right.
"okay. we're right with you, gordy."
...
okay. okay. i'll get - i'll get you_ scoop for you. have you been leaving it cocked like that?
"there's north, cross-sun; okay. how's that, jim, is that okay for you?"
"okay, but it had a lens brush, 16-_illimeter mag_, three of them?"
"you have delta-t. of zero; burn time was about zg 1 second short, i'd say, huh? ..."
stand by 1. time skip 05 20 41 b1 cmp - - and my prd is 23149.
that's sure not what we tried out in houston - i mean at the cape. that's metal with glass on top of it.
0kay_ will terminate 509 after p24.
"okay, i'll bring her in."
roger. that sounds like probably a better way to go.
- - started training building.
"roger, jack. go ahead."
"okay, mount camera, tether tongs. see if my camera's going to work. bob, i'm on - on bravo - mag bravo and frame count 19."
i got it.
"ken, houston."
"..., john. we saw it come in."
okay. that sounds a little - little on the (eagle) high side.
roger. f
you want high bit rate?
how about - -
"that's a lot better, johnny [sic]."
we're burning.
*** we understand tge stowed and you're taken care of in the comm. and you might give us a rover read-out either now or when you get to the sep.
"roger. 00 04 hl 07 lmp houston, are you ready for us to start charging battery b?"
"okay; we've got the camera back together. okay, fredo, for your info, the cdr's commander is reading 117."
roger. mighty fine.
"houston, orion. over."
yes. i haven't seen inclusions in the other half.
roger.
okay. let me get one more scoopful.
"okay, houston, master arm's on, two lights."
"bob, i'm going to take the pan at ll - feet, so you can see the fragments that we are going to pick up here. then we can take another one at - for location work."
*** got to push this latch on the - on the gate to get it locked - on the pallet to get it locked.
"okay. understand handover, we might lose the comm."
let met get your bags - i left nv camera off when i -
"okay. let me verify that we've got all the covers closed. one, two - covers are closed. panel 230, mapping camera, off. sounder recorder is off, ir is off, self test, heaters to - just about. you can get - you can work in that direction now. you're happy with loose items and everything?"
"yes, i didn't get you a - i didn't get you a pendulum, but i don't know where i would, bob. okay. i'm going to have to take you out to the vip site - -"
"whoopie! man, that may have been a small one for neil, but that's a long one for me. i'm going to step off the pad."
okay.
"hold the rake a second. we got to be moving in how many minutes, bob?"
"roger, copy your mark."
okay; i'm prepared to do that right now if you're ready.
"yes, you have."
okay. you know that bright spot might already be there; but i don't think so. i don't remember seeing it.
okay. ohhh! *** we've got to get two harnesses here. don levas. look at that scratch right in the middle of that thing. okay. don levas and lower protective visor.
"ah, i think it's ... there."
"okay, dave. you're down quite a bit. scratch the black, and white magazine mike mike that was on the 500. leave that onboard the lm, and you can use ww, which is on the next line up there, for the 500 millimeter. add two more 16 millimeters, golf golf and hotel hotel."
all right; 5-d?
i appreciate that.
all set to open it.
_at?
"let me look, pete. i have one here. let me get it out for you."
scs.
"oh, okay. 08 0y 17 25 cc and i'm standing by."
3000 miles to go?
"i mean, it's open now. i'm - i'm sorry, bob. it is now open and reading 0.6. it read 0.6 when it was closed."
track mode to slew.
you do that pretty quick.
okay.
"okay. on your present page, there - the uv solar _ atmosphere pad, at 160:b8."
"okay, you can do that as soon as you get your sequence camera under hand there, while i start doing the secondary glycol loop check. secondary - secondary cool loop pump, ac 1. and i heard it come on."
"both to auto? tell me when - lighting: anunciator and numerics, bright."
320 shows that? something's screwy. something's wrong. our third one shows it's going to be 64 000. it's - just making kind of a sweep up. might be this tapemeter problem we saw on our self- check.
"houston, challenger. cdr's now back on."
let's wait until we get - get daylight on the whole spacecraft.
i do that ...
(laughter) i speak for the challenger.
"- - the seal is already made. if we could tape those handles down, we'd probably have a vacuum in there. f 06 04 41 45 cdr-eva okay."
there you go.
"roger. okay, i guess she's about 150 feet dead ahead."
the lens brush is there ...
"(chuckle) okay, let's see. i've got -we're coming up on 4 minutes."
okay.
"ral - _fhat did you say, ralph?"
charlie's already said all he can say about it. and he said it 45 or 50 times already.
"biomed, off. pag5e-22 tconfiden tiiil 6"
they should'ye seen that.
"yes, sir. it's our policy."
"okay, i copy that."
can you - okay.
okay.
"okay, ron. understand."
16. roger. go for loi.
we're about 25 feet in front of the surveyor crater. 04 19 18 41 i24p that's good. that's where we wanted to he.
"thank you, dave. we copy all that."
...
roger.
"yes, we can do that - i guess just because that rock's in there, huh?"
"roger. stand by a minute, please."
"108,285.1."
what is - what is that thing with a v in it? 05 23 59 56 i_p-eva that's cinco e.
"roger. and at 167:05, starting with man cam - mapping camera, off, delete everything through enable all jets down to about 167:14."
"apollo 15, this is houston."
"okay, houston. he's going to wear purge valve 211. it's not perfectly matched, but i see no problems with it. it's a lot freer."
"okay, jack. we'll pass that along."
stand by.
"okay, jim, your seatbelt is going to have to get readjusted - because i'm going - i want to make sure i get the lr cubed tied down good here."
"yes, when i read it out to you. not before."
y'all going to give up on the heat - are you going to give up on the heat flow?
okay. did - was that real obvious to them?
"they're going okay, karl. looks like i've caught up a little bit. got all the dumps out of the way, and got the libration photography. looks like i'm going to be handicapped a little bit because of the mission timer, but we'll press on."
i don't see it.
"maybe we all ought to slide down a little, and then - and then ken can - -"
"okay. you've made your corem check with me. jim, ..."
"well, i thought you were saying you didn't have your radar, and i thought that made good sense."
"yes. you'd better check them, because we got a barber pole on that one."
"oh, very well. pan camera power is coming off. _-_"
"houston, emergency cab repress is off."
you better watch that; you're pretty close to your 6 feet.
okay.
roger.
get it ... i guess. better than ...

it's - yeah - how about that? they work'
"okay, stand by 1."
"houston, 15."
"john, have i still got my scb on my back?"
"columbia, houston. first of all, we'd like a waste-water dump to 10 percent on the backside. secondly, it does not look like we are going to need any plane change at this time, so we will not be uplinking a new refsmmat. third item, i would like all of your cryo heaters to auto, and we are ready for a battery charge, battery bravo; it will last about 7 hours. if you should go to sleep, we will be terminating that batr charge, but at the moment, we can go ahead and start the batt charge on batt bravo. and a final item, for your sm rcs configuration for your rest period, register 1 for the dap is 11111; dap register 2, 01100. and your auto rcs select (goss net 1) tape 67/12 switches, quad alfa, pitch jets on only, quad bravo all on, quad charlie and quad delta all off. over. 0_ 09 02 57 cmp roger. dump waste water to 10 percent on the (columbia backside. use prior refsmmat, cryo heaters on to auto, battery b charge until i go to sleep. dap is 11111, 01100. select quads a pitch only on, c and d all up. over."
"boy, these thrusters are sure ......"
"*** more on papa, yes."
"okay. what, 28039?"
and i'll try to get a reading on what it is - some pictures of it as we come up to it.
"okay. i'm going to take these pictures that joe requested. and if you need any help, just holler, and i'll be right back."
roger. 04 03 21 07 cm_ roger. would you believe you've got thrusters on board that vehicle. 04 03 22 04 cml' give me a call just as soon as your hot-.f_re ]_ complete _ please.
"yes, i know it's clean. let's forget it."
and there's - the pictures ought to be able to - the pictures ought to pin down its - at least the end of the boulder track pretty well.
go shead.
"roger. descent 1, and it looks like p64 at 9:23."
you can see the data.
roger.
"nell, this is houston. we seem to be reading you now. how do,you read us? over. 04 15 56 cdr ics, push to talk. (tranq)"
"okay. geno, we sampled some of the light-colored group - as a matter of fact, this block looks different."
mark it. cdr dropped from 3.75 to 3.60.
"endeavour, this is houston. you're go for plane change 1."
roger. thank you. i_-eva i hope they came out.
"roger, al. and you can leave the dial in inter- b_diate. we're fat on the - for the feedwater."
"okay, the laser is on. the camera is extended, and the cover is open."
00155. 03 23 50 34 i_mp go.
"yon're going to have to get your plss down a little; roll toward me. 04 17 46 55 cde okay, coming over."
"now, if you go forward."
"here's the big rocks down here, charlie."
go ahead.
down to the boresight star. 06 18 25 51 lmi° okay. that's what i wanted. none of this other.
"11_ houston. we do have three lines across our tv. i thought it was just a transmission problem, but everybody's telling me now that it's prob- ably - it's on the downlink. over."
okay.
"that's what they tell me. and the other one is those - the biggy up at dallas right now. the · giants leading the dallas cowboys in the third period 21 to 3. 20 to 3; i'll correct that, 20 to 3."
is it oblong or round?
"houston, are you planning to give us a state vector update."
caught in the same way again.
"the propellant is at 210; the fuel manifold at - and ox manifold is - correction, make it 215 - or 220. and everything else looks pretty good. pressures are holding up - you think the burst"
"okay. i presume that what this means is looking to the south. it was cross-sun originally. i suspect that's what happened here, the way it was written up. *** 7-foot looking at the - all the switches to make sure you guys turned them the right way, i suppose. and then a 7-foot looking down-stm, so that would be facing west, that side of it. 196 day"
"aquarius, houston. 04 01 41 20 i24p go ahead."
okay.
"yes, it's pretty dry."
...?
*** doff suits here shortly.
high gain is auto.
"we in houston copy that and echo your sentiments, and dr. fletcher is here beside me. he'd like to say a word to the two of you."
"all right. the knobs are - let's see, about plus 20 and 185."
hers got it. you're right again.
did you get finished?
doing fine. i'm trying to get around swp over here ' and start hitting that - -
okay. at 175:13.
"okay; 28:20 i'm - going - going to read to you seven lines of instructions here, and they're all reproduced two pages over in your flight plan at 30:30. your choice as to whether you want to copy them or just look two pages ahead. i'll go ahead and read the lines now."
"that's vhf noise, jack. vhf b."
"boy, this is ridiculous. ridiculous."
"hey, you're right."
yes.
"this is in bag 17, fred. sixteen got used - some time back."
okay.
"... visors do_m. hey, charlie, where i tripped over here is a lot of white rock."
okay.
roger. we're hearing the same.
i think i'm losing my mind.
"i see why we planned all this before i came. 06 04 25 41 i_p-eva okay, the plate's installed."
"oh, yes. i got a satisfactory - every once in a while, i can hear them now; they're cutting in and out somewhere, and i don't know where. da_ 5 i _'' 1-13"
okay. earth at 18. thank you. 01413 04 23 cmp okay. and we didn't see the moon that time.
"i'll wait. o0 o0 42 b9 lmp okay, i'll - i know scfneof that stuff has got to be coming over to me, and i'm - - o000 42 40 cdr you ain't ready for it?"
"you might refer, if you want to see what's going on, to drawing 8.9 down in area e-b. we're playing with the - delta-v thrust switch, and the idea is this. first of all, let's open the - the group 5 circuit breakers on panel 229, both main a and main b. that's a backup to the sps pilot valves on panel 8, which we also want open. verify that."
"boy, are we on a slope! i_ip-eva okay. i'm going to stay out from between the rocks. it's a beautiful east-west split rock. it's even got a north overhang that we can work with. and let me see what it is. we're right at station 6. you wouldn't believe it."
"and, gordie, could i have a quick status report on - on america and challenger?"
"yes, because it's now fallen down to where the - the - -"
"okay, and it's 7 hours right now."
we've got it.
"was doing temporary battle with our friend, the trash bag. i have you, visual. tallyho."
"oh, really?"
"and how's the trench going, jack?"
about 4.
we're in the attitude; let me get- -
"did you get a locator, by any chance?"
roger. you're a regular human weather satellite.
"yeah, i reaa you. 07 10 03 03 l_ houston, orion. over."
"ready, go."
roger. 01 i0 32 51 cc roger. we see a real display now.
okay.
i can't see the s-ivb. it's gone.
"okay. cb: coas/tunnel lighting, main b, closed."
"while you're eating or getting ready to eat, i can update some of the news for you tonight, if you're away from the windows. or are y'all still looking out?"
"yes, 5 seconds ...."
like a champ.
"aquarius, earth. oh 22 26 37 cc go ahead."
"i might take a look at that, too. i hate to argue with success, but i need that dexterity today. bob, i don't know if you caught it yesterday - a little interesting facet of the whole 2-eva exercise was the fact that i've already worn -"
that's why i set up there.
"why don't you pul him on the headsets, jim, and i'll read it out to him."
say again. yes. okay.
"i might drive up there. i_p-eva yes. now, bob, station 6 rock - one of them - is from that boulder track that runs obliquely across the contour."
"keep talking, ron. i'm walking that one with you."
"houston, everything looks okay so far. 36 fide"
all right.
let me get your bag off.
"we're digging the bottom of the trench for you, fredo."
"okay, good. 06 05 03 02 ia{p-eva that tape came off your plss, dave."
"yes, he's counting on it."
"okay, gang, i'm sure sorry about this, but that number 2 servo _s just oscillating like a wild man."
the commander doesn't think that i can see the engine bell on that thing.
i think it's the battery temp. nub'let 2 is 135.
it's open.
... my jacket. there's a boo2ie. got to be down there somewhere.
"okay, tom."
good show. 07 03 00 24 lm_-lm with two rock bags.
"no, it's not tucked away. i can bring it out - real fast."
"roger. just use lima lima as scheduled, but don't - don't use any spare shots on it. and the last one is just a sum up here, ron."
- - and 11.7 -
we're showing a 10th of a pound right now.
"plus l, plus 1. _4 - day 4 page 83"
"well, i'll say one thing - the force to deploy this thing i can sense is exactly the same as it was in one g - and i keep wondering when the power wire is going to bust. 05 02 03 46 l_p-eva okay, tony. i have lmp's camera."
"now, that's complicated."
- - full decrease.
"roger, 15. we're ready to copy."
...
"okay, pete. go ahead with you p30 pad."
"roger, jim. we're looking."
"attitude control, three of them, pulse."
"hello, apollo 11. houston. we're read m to put you to bed and say good night, if you give us your crew status report and verify that you changed out the co2 canister a moment a_o. over."
okay; we're 1 second off.
"roger. we copy. standby a minute, please."
... star gazing.
"no, go ahead."
"i'll try - here try it - you're over there, you know i've worn the rtv off that hammer already."
six what?
is it snowing in there yet?
"okay. copy that. '['ape 75/9 }'_u't' [2t<' 04 1'3 38 47 cc okay. l_eady 1:o copy the bm'? 0il15 38 52 cmp okay. go ahead. oh 15 38 55 cc okay. on panel 16 circuit breaker, ep,_,eat ft'e!> ties, two, open; and now you've got to listen real carefully for high volts and low volts, t_attery 1, high volts, to off/reset; battery 2, low volts, to off/res ,uia'nd then on: battery 2, high volts, to off/reset and then on; battery 1, high volts, on; and then the circuit breaker on panel 16, eps: bat feeu3ties, both of them, closed. read back."
oh.
go ahead.
"if you're looking at me, what i'm talking about is this depression - is this depression in here for the core - oh, maybe 15, 20 meters out in here. jack, what did you have in mind for the neutron flux?"
roger. understeud.
that hose - that inlet hose on my side - -
now let me just turn real slow.
right here.
go to the - go to the technique for a lash and ... it's the burn technique.
okay. i've removed the umbilicals - the csm/lm umbilicals. guess i need to install the probe and the drogue. i'll get those things done right now.
what time's that first ... landmark tracking?
"challenger, houston. we've got three questions for you to help pin down your exact position, any time it's convenient. maybe when you're taking the out-the-window pictures. over."
no. i didn't touch it.
"okay. and we're working out detailed procedures on that, jack."
we ought to get -
small rocks and smaller - -
"the lm: plus 301.09, plus 284.53, plus 359.48; csm: plus three zeros 35, plus 104.67, plus 000.52. the time, 110:24:00. over."
yeah.
"okay, we're going in."
okay; about a centimeter deep - skim.
"vent flag, p."
roger.
... yes. what'll we use the others for?
"hadley base, houston. over."
okay. that's a good readback.
"this is houston. we can see buzz's right hand. it is somewhat out of focus. i'd say _e were focusing do_,mto probably - oh, about _ inches to a foot behind the position of his hc_ndwhen he was pulling out the cable. 04 13 55 21 lm[p okay. how's the temperature on there?"
"and surgeon tells me it's on the left side, dave. 05 20 53 47 cdr-_ okay, you've got pressure on it now."
okay.
"that doesn't make any difference, does it?"
"it's right over here. it is, yeah. here's where we had the double - you want it where we had the double core, tony?"
"well, we just got our first view of the earth this morning, and, can you believe it's getting larger and it's getting smaller? we see just a very, very thin sliver of a very large round ball."
"oh, they're talking to me, huh?"
"columbia, houston. stand by one."
we couldn't see the bottom of it.
"we should lock on you and give you range and range rate. 04 03 45 45 cmlp no, i thought you were saying that you didn't have your radar. i thought that's ... good sense. 04 03 45 49 i2_2p no. we got plenty."
okay.
"okay. now be careful about the glass. oonfid enti,a.t. .- day 6 page 363"
i can. i got it.
okay. let's get grabs before you guys leave.
"16, would it help you if we called you to advise you when your rates are sufficiently damped in these different skylabs."
"okay, houston. we're going to switch windows herewith the tv camera, so we can switch windows f_ with the camera cameras."
"sorry about that, bob. i misunderstood. i thought - i see it now - h2 and 02. i'll go into that now."
"okay, ed; go with the - radar angles."
"america, if we should lose you before our published los here_ check the dse and when you get the barber pole, you can reconfigure. we're rewinding _hat tape now."
"and, 16, would you verify gamma ray on? 09 04 51 24 _ yes, sir. the experiment is on."
copy 2.0. thank you.
what are we gonna do with this scb right here? 05 23 17 28 i/_p-eva that one goes under my - that one is going on my back. that's the one i emptied yesterday.
okay; copy.
"roger, john."
"cb(16) ecs: cabin repress, open."
yaw should be zero in 1 minute? okay.
"okay. why don't you just tell us, you know, which window, and we'll go to wherever - 0b 08 26 15 cdr oh, okay."
"well, at least something worked on this flight."
you done with the gnomon?
"okay, i'm stable at about 3.8. how about you? 05 22 ll 29 _wp-l_ same here."
"and, houston, fred will handle the camera as we go through the postdocking checklist."
oh; zero.
"well, _nything _n this one over - -"
"eagle, houston."
"you've got - what? is yours off over there, too, charlie? o0 08 09 33 _ what's off_"
yes.
"okay, then we got the right place then, if it should be. okay, we're stopped and we're 180, 087, 2.8, 0.8, ll5, ll5, 72, 72, 100, 100, off-scale low, off-scale low."
"okay. would you like for me to just read you all the questions, and let you mull those over before you work on it, or you want to do one at a time?"
okay. we want you to hold your maneuver until we finish making the load. we haven't completed it yet. are you ready to copy p30 maneuver pad?
how far out from the moon?
okay.
drive power should be nominal.
i couldn't understand why he sounded so garbled there. 00 02 2h 55 cmp you aren't kidding. 00 02 24 56 imp you ain't the only one.
"that's up to you guys, but, it seems to me, it would be more convenient."
"and there's nothing particularly significant that you can see on the map there. it's just that the la hire rilles seem to be associated with a lot of those flows, and the flows - there are so many of them, they are - and they're so overlapping and intermingling that i just want to get some general pictures of those flows comlng out of la hire."
"10; uh-uh. and i'll get the pro. (cough) about a 2-1/2, one-potato, two-potato, shutdown-type thing."
"now again, i saw no evidence of - of any kind of a rock slide to the south of tsiolkovsky, but the one on the west there is, looks - you know every- time i go over it - it certainly confirms my opinion that that's a rock slide. the lineaments, the way the - the thing ended, the lobate - the lobate tongues on it and everything. it's inter- r esting that the rim of tsiolkovsky, on the west side there, is - different from - across that tape94/52 fault zone - is quite different from it is around the rest of the crater, maybe suggesting that that's -_ the source of the flow. the rim seems to be not as sharply defined; it's lower and appears to be out from the edge of the basin more than the rest of the - of the boundary or the rest of the ejecta pattern around tsiolkovsky, and there where that very steep, almost smooth scarp is, on the west of tsiolkovsky, seems to be the - the point at which it starts."
(laughter) ...
yes. one of those loose ones.
there are some fairly good blocks sitting up by themselves there - -
"falcon, hourston."
"all right, i'll call you at 58:20. what do we do?"
"golly, we've got things all set up here and we're kind of standing by for a logic check - whenever you guys - can give us a go."
roger. copy.
"say, gene, we're going to have to - -"
and we're coming up on the right - -
"houston, 11. we have a crew status report for you."
got to ... these goddam ...
"got a busy day tomorrow, and we'll - we'll be with you then. tapes 50-53/1 apollo 17 air-t0-ground voice transcription rw_t period - no communications apollo 17 air-to-ground voice transcription"
"okay, joe. we'll get that for you, f--_ tape 36/1 apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription"
i didn't get mine filed. and this is serious; would you - -
i don't know who the hell is going to do it for you.
"yes. yes, you want to go farther east, dave."
no.
four - yeah. 04;30.
"well, i'm about ready."
"that's where i was supposed to go, wasn't i, was free?"
*_* we're through with that card. 0h 11 50 42 lmp okay.
try it again with the kitchen timer.
"yeah. 04 00 52 59 i24p okay, forward detent."
"here, let me roll it over. go ahead. want to put it in?"
"okay; so it looks like it's sta - stable there, isn't it?"
"stand by. stand by on that, jack."
and the rover's [sic] a little black blob over there at about 12:30.
give us that heading again. -
go ahead.
okay.
- - this is ridiculous.
"during the housekeeping. 03 22 05 h9 cdr don't worry about it, charlie. 03 22 05 50 _ i know it. i just wanted to write it down for the 17 guys."
okay. close the door. watch your handle there; watch your handle.
"okay, houston. we're pressing ahead here, about 5 minutes early. /_ cc roger."
okay. and you're going to be in auto and att hold.
"okay. i say - i got a film status report for you. and i'd like to ask you a question about the optics. i'd like to stow the optics instead of leaving them up, _lless the temperatures are gonna get too high. and the reason for this is that every time we run around past the sun, it's like throwing a spotlight inside."
stand by.
roger.
"okay. there you are, pete."
"okay. we copied it, john."
"okay. my comm panel: okay; s-band, t/r; ics to t/r; relay, off; modes vox; vox sensitivity, max; vtifa, t/r and b, receive. okay; cb(16) comm: se audio, open; and collect [sic] - you connect so the ***"
"okay; in work. let's see, 287. that's a heading *** city to tindall. okay; 27 28, 287 right on the money."
420. okay.
"(laughter) yes. got to get the dust cover on the ..., okay?"
roger.
roger.
sure it would.
that's affirm. i'll go back. stand by.
*** - -
"oh, man, this -"
yes.
mark.
"okay, ll. very good. now, with respect to the documented sample container: on television it appeared to us as though the ssnsoles for that container were in fact being given - being selected in accordance with some thought or consideration being given to the rocks them- selves. and we were wondering if you could give any further details from memory about any of these samples, and the context of the material or the surface from which they were taken. over. (goss net l) tape 97/5 06 0t 39 56 cdr yes. you remember i initially starte d on the cut side of the lm that the tv camera ws_ on, il]ici 1 t,ook il [lljnib¢'t' oi' llaibj)]{,,q o[' ro(_kzl oll th(, surface, and ucveral that weru jusl liul)_lii'i'i_c_ -- about 20 - 15 to 20 feet north of the t/q. and then i recalled that that area had been probably swept pretty well by the exhaust of the descent engine, so i crossed over to the southern side of the ir, and took a number of samples from the area around the elongate double crater that we commented on, and several beyond that, and tried to take as many different types - of rock types as i could see by eye - as i could in the short time we had available. there were a number of other samples that i had seen earlier in our stroll around the ir that i had hoped to get back and pick up and put in the documented sam- ple, but i didn't get those, and i'll be able to comment in detail when we get in the debriefing session."
"- - you can sample secondary craters, and they tend to have blocks either in them or on one rim, sug- gesting that you could tell directions if you put your mind to it. directions of the - where the secondaries came from. these are small ones."
okay. we're standing by.
mark.
yeah. there's the satellite and everything. (laughter) probably shouldn't tell them that. that'll scare them. that'll - that'll upset them.
okay.
yes. wily don't you get it ih if you got - get it at 30 seconds.
"apollo 15, this is houston. we'd like to have you retract the mass spectrometer boom for 85 seconds."
we're ready.
"oh, yes. that was pretty."
"that right? 06 01 06 37 imp-eva yes. a little angular fragment, joe, about 2 inches long."
"16, bring up the high gain now, please."
let me get your antenna.
*** locked. *** down and back?
okay.
"good show. okay, jim. you ready with the circuit breakers ?"
"no, we sure didn't. that one out of b just came right out."
yeah.
"okay, houston. it appears to be okay now; we've changed our attitude slightly, and i have a star and i'm maneuvering to get the m-line parallel."
"thank you, houston."
i know.
"looks good, pete."
"okay. my plss 02 quantity is 90 percent. how about yours, jim? 05 21 52 27 lvip reading 92."
"okay, thank you. _p houston, 17."
the x-axis is beyond 45 degrees out of velocity vector.
my what? plug it into this thing? yes.
believe it or not.
...
looking as hard as we can.
"yes. right now; yes, it's dropped off to about the 70-percent point, joe, and it was before up about 85."
"okay. and, after this, we'd like you to move to the rim of the main crater, and spend some time just describing the rocks you see, and then sample the rim."
thank you. (tranq)
"roger. skipping down several lines; delta-v cg, lm/csm."
"say again, 15. was that 233 seconds, and 3 min- utes and 9 seconds?"
"yeah, i see."
you're right. it's not going to stay at zero.
o.9.
okay.
"doesn't appear that we ha_e, chariie. that pitch annie was 357. 08 03 09 16 i.mp okay, 357. 140, 357, 000 for boom jett."

"okay, 1 minute."
"okay. okay, karl. stand by 1."
"okay. sounds good. 06 01 06 58 ia{p-eva man, john. you're doing a great job. okay, tony, coming back downslope 354 at 3.8 is about the same stuff."
"11, this is houston. we have about 6 minutes remaining until los, and in order that we may configure our ground lines, we'd like to know if you're still planning to have the tv up with the beginning of the next pass. over. 03 05 34 48 cdb roger, houston. we'll try to have it ready."
ail right. what might that be?
- - ...
"i think i may have gone the wrong way. i did. i went to min instead of max. here it comes. oh, boy. oh, boy. man. watch it. okay, jack. you're all right. still deploying."
one foot per second too.
"okay. coming up on 87 hours and 35 minutes, we will be there in 30 seconds. set it for 87.35."
"go ahead, aquarius."
"yep. did that this morning. i mean, after the first ... what time did they say we get the aos? about -"
okay. switch to pump 2.
"okay, i'm looking for - i'm dying to find out what this mound is over here anyhow, al. we got a very peculiar mound sticking up out of the ground, houston, that i want to go look at. as a matter of fact, i think i'll go take a picture of it. oh my -"
what's it getting now?
"okay, thank you."
that means you didn't eat much.
"okay. and we assume you got all the necessary circuit breakers in, ac and dc?"
"yes, you might tweak that up. we are getting a good signal, but go ahead and tweak it up just a little bit."
"take a look. it's about 5-1/2 now, gene."
down there.
"roger; we saw it, and fao's working on it."
roger. out. (goss net 1) tape 115/3
okay.
"okay. good readback. next one i have is the no pdi plus 12 abort, item echo. ip_p-i_ go ahead."
"oh, would you look at all that. we could use some helmet stowage bags."
"i - well, ken can transmit for us."
okay. down and locked.
"go ahead, ed."
"yeah, but i haven't started my second one. i'm going to wait and pull those after we get going."
"okay, i'm going to trim. 04 1_ 17 24 lmp okay."
"america, houston. you can go with the h20 purge heaters now."
"okey; then everything ""_4 to csm transfer list,"" the rest of that colurmn on the left side, and the whsle right side, we can scratch. if you wanted to, i guess you - -"
that 's firm.
"apollo ll, this is houston. we would like to terminate charging battery bravo at 51 30 get. over."
"it's a lot better when you get the cabin depressurized. 09 02 4b 40 cml° well, i'm still showing about three-quarters."
"turn into the sun. okay. · 06 04 27 09 cdr-eva ... your ... 06 04 27 10 i_mp-eva it's okay. won't even see that. okay. the dac is set at f/8 at 12 frames a second. and i'm not going to turn it on until we start moving, tony."
"okay, pete. during the burn, when the engine came on, the pressure started down."
"ail right. cdr-i_ okay. we just had our drjnw. you can turn drink - descent water, off."
"... ascent bats, off. 07 03 00 59 cdr-l_ roger. ascent bats going on now, ed."
okay.
pin is pulled.
getting this camera set.
"tony, you got to be kidding."
okay.

i can't even see the massifs with the naked eye. no. see the dark area there next to _.. - -
...
"go ahead, houston."
"okay, ready."
*** for 4 minutes for *** 04 08 25 34 l_p reading me any better now?
i've got it. 04 23 52 58 lm2 and i'll pass you the lec.
no. this is the second - this is rim of it. it's very soft. i didn't have any trouble digging down with the shovel.
"well, i - -"
that sounds like a dented tire; that's how it sounds.
let's go over the checklist.
"roger. we saw that, buzz. thank you much. out. 04 06 27 09 _ all right. i say again - okay. that wasn't an (eagle) alarm; that was a code. okay. 04 0b i_ cc roger. we saw that."
not until we get there. i - i think i set it.
"i don't think we're qualified to make that decision. it was made by people on the ground that are far more qualified to do that sort of thing than we are. if - if we had been told to do that, we would have certainly done it."
that's good. okay. verify cb's per initial activa- tion status check.
"orion, this is houston. i have the circ pad if you're ready to copy."
ail right.
- - eyeballs or whatever they are.
that's affirmative.
"okay, i've got it in. i_m going to call p52."
"roger, buzz. that's a good readback. you're about two-by with these omni's in this configura- tion; we won't have very good comm until we get through with the p22. over."
"in the block where it says ""solar corona and limb brightening photos,"" cross out ""and limb brighten- ing photos"" and just put ""solar corona, optional."""
"there it goes. okay, watch that - '' 04 20 09 46 i34p is there anything that's not tied on?"
"okay, don't. okay, we'll - we'll get them when we get the tongs out, jack."
"i'm just reading it. okay. the lmp had depleted both the primary and secondary water tanks, and the cdr had approximately 2 hours remaining. and the ib_p's 02 use rate was higher than expected due to high metabolic rate. cdr's 02 rate was nominal."
it's out of this window. crookes's supposed to be.
okay.
stand by. let's run the lmp check here. -_
pitch is 088.2.
ecs looks good.
"oh, okay."
"okay, i'm reading you 5 by, casper. how me?"
just take some of it off.
now one thing i can't do is see the map.
***hand tool carrier.
"okay. we got them. 05 12 i0 36 cdr okay. _ne bottom core tube wil_ be n's_ber _, no tab. tolg core tube will be n'_m_er 3, no tab. 05 12 10 5_ cc roger, al. top, number 3, no t_b; bottom, n'mv- ber 2, no tab. 05 12 11 01 cer that is correct. 05 12 12 o_ lmp okay. i need a pair of tongs -"
on the what?
"hello, hadley base; this is houston. regarding the water separator number l: just to give you a warm feeling, it's - it's working perfectly now. it looks as though we just had a temporary - temporarily there, some water run down from the hoses and waterlogged it, but it's working perfectly now. over."
"al, the solar corona photography should is - start in about i minute. 05 04 b1 36 cmp roger, karl. right with you. count down 45 seconds."
"okay. cb(ll) comm: cdr audio, open."
okay.
"dave, we read all that. we're getting a beautiful picture now. we're going to try to wind up with the tripod in the shade, if that's possible, looking back towards the lm. 'rape78/18"
"you know, as we move out from the moon, i think that by looking at the varied szructures on the sufface, that we can see from here, i 6uess n'/ impression of it is that the hoon may k;e4 uii!ion years old plus, but it sure had a - an2 i% may eventually have stop}ed growing s._%er the first 500 million or changing dynamics_fly, like ttte earth changes, but during that first 500 million years, it was certainly busy cause it reail? has a lo% of variety down there, and we haven't ev_,h beg'or_to scratch the surface of mae cc:l - complexity of the stet%r. that's my persona_ o_inlon."
"lamp/tone test, off."
"while i'm at it, i'm going to chop another piece off right here."
ioo
"yes, sir. will do."
"okay, i don't think - -"
time is 167:20 - -
"okay, tony, the cable is broken off right at the connector. and it's - i can - there's about an inch and a half of silver material right in my hand at the end of the broken piece, and, as i look at the cable, it's right at the - the connector, rather; it's right at the connector - broken off right there. over."
"we copy that, charlie."
how about that.
- - and compliments to the cap comim.
"jack, houston."
...
okay.
"okay. the recorder's staying on and we'll turn the - radar, off?"
"you know that noise - that whistling - is coming from you, pete, because every time you move around, it whistles. when you stop, it quits."
okay. we'll get to it here. just a second.
dang gummit.
"no. 45, because -"
507.
"mar}(. young - a streak at the top of the right cenl_er of the right eye, going from - going out the top."
"challenger, you're go for enter."
"okay. right before 2 hours and 15 minutes, i assume that's before ms?n gives their p27 update, i do a verb 74. right?"
"i'll get the penetrometer drum, so don't worry about that."
yes.
"roger, houston. apollo 11. did you get the word on the entry checklist?"
"we copy, dave."
"you need - you need - you need fine displays if you're gonna fly something like this, and tell us beforehand."
"(laughter) yes, we did a - all that jazz. that's something i don't need right now, uniess you want it. 07 04 l0 4_ inp ... that one."
"okay, getting ready for the bus ties."
roger; copy.
"i'm right over here, babe."
"it is flat. for crying out loud. what do you want, airtight guarantee?"
"go ahead, orion."
good.
okay. your ttca to throttle at min.
"let's see, a0s is at 2 hours before the burn?"
"and, after we go ems mode to standby, like for you to add ""circuit breaker t_s, two, to open."""
"*** it on a rock. cdr_eva oh, boy."
...
yes. i can see it. just barely see it out of nv window.
"by golly, i did clean my sinuses out. (laughter)"
"right, i don't mind at all."
mark lmp. again it was a streak; it was - appeared to be in both eyes; moving from i o'clock toward the center; intensity 3.
"hey, houston; orion. how do we look for aps tpi?"
"no, we just do that during the mission planning stages."
"i'm going down this slope and up the other side, jack."
287:22:56.28.
i'm very worried about that.
"bob, jack's ready to take the pad."
"go ahead, joe."
.-- coming open.
"go ahead, houston."
"fortunately, he's - he's the kind of a guy that's ... used to kidding, though. other people, i think, might believe that kind of reasoning."
let me get your bags - i left my camera off when i -
"okay, we're at frame 60 on magazine 00."
okay ....
but i'm not going to throw my yo-yo away. ' nasa _ msc
okay.
*** jack. i think you better help gene with that - recovering that core there where the finger is going to fall out.
and the pan camera self test - or talkback is gray.
do you want the t-ephem first?
"houston, it's very interesting to note that when i kick my foot *** with no atmosphere here, and this gravity *** they seem to leave, and most of them have about the same angle of departure and velocity. from where i stand, a large portion of them will impact at a certain distance out. several *** the percentage is, of course, that will impact *** different regions *** it's highly dependent upon *** the initial trajectory upward *** where most of the *** already the particles are found, ... terrain."
"yes, the right one is still up."
"okay, we - we got to get the - -"
lights go off.
- - then you've got to do your presleep checklist and we'll see you - -
you see it in there?
"that's correct. then at ei minus 1 plus 10, we'll perform scs powerup per checklist, page g/2-4."
dust.
"very good, dave."
0keydoke.
okay. 04 08 12 22 _ that's voice backup.
... data file.
okay.
"roger. for jack, we missed the star angle differ- ence on the p52. would you read us that?"
i got them. zero - -
sounded good.
"i'll have them verify that, but off the top of my head, i'm sure it's going to be all right. we'll check it, fred."
"it is. pcm, high; biomed, right. you got the sequence camera?"
page 4-16.
cepy that.
"okay, i'm going off vox. have a good trip."
"and, jack, i presume that's magazine november november. 0b 07 46 53 lmp that's affirm, bob. apollo 17 air-to-ground voice transcription"
why don't they have a picture like that in the simulator?
beautiful. beautiful. 70 and 92. i copy.
how did you get in reverse? -- cdr-eva i don't know.
"okay, tony, read that on the uv. houston, the for_rard 2-1/2 to 3 inches of the cassette hand - all the handle is in the sunlight. but the - the battery temp on the uv is still black at a - at 100."
"roger. at the - at the end of step 4, before ""repeat 4-frame sequence,"" we write ""cmc mode, auto."" and we delete ""repeat 4-frame"" - -"
i'm going to get a down-sun and a cross-sun here.
roger.
"at any rate, frame number 31, frame number 31 ..."
"45.3, is that right, al?"
not zero-phase right now?
"on hi mult, landing radar/computer; monitor, the pgns. pgns - guidance; ags - mode select. altitude/altitude rate. supercrit pressure, 1220; ambient pressure, 390."
"oh, i've got i_. okay; it's down. and if you can hand me -"
mark cmp.
"we're going to burn plus 0.5, plus 0.2, plus 0.7."
"okay, minus 27 and 339."
roger.
"jim, if you'll go ahead and set the angles in, we'll give you the cue when we're ready for you to select the high gain. 01 02 06 25 _ okay."
"okay, that's why you got the hi 02 flow."
tv's - - 06 00 56 40 irp-eva - - because we're at the full mark on the mag.
"okay, and unless i miss my guess, your seat is out near the alsep now. so that is beautiful."
okay. 0b 06 37 09 cdr you want jim to count down at 6 minutes?
"yes. okay, houston. we'll be dropping down out of sight for a while, probably. going down in - in a depression. o_ 19 50 27 cdr well, i don't know. 04 19 50 30 lm1d i don't know either. let's stop a minute, al."
go ahead.
"ll, houston. mike, we see about a 96 heartbeat now."
"yes, a little more. lmi°-eva it's - all of this is getting mixed a little bit with a - about a half-centimeter thick light-gray or a medium-gray covering over the whole area."
"okay, i turned the tone off. okay, it's off."
i've got a tone; it's water tone. okay; i'm going to go after that hatch. can you slip to the right as far as you can? got it.
"and 11, houston. we have a request for you. on the service module secondary propellant fuel pressurization valve: as a precautionary measure, we'd like you to momentarily cycle the four switches to the close position and then release. as you know, we have no tm or talkback on these valve positions, and it's conceivable that one of them might also h_ve been moved into a dif- ferent position by the shock of separ_ tion. over. 00 0_ 50 11 cmt okay. good idea. _%at's being done."
"not convinced, dave."
"a local one, you mean?"
that 's yours.
"the purge valve to depress. cb configuration. okay? cb(16) ecs: suit fan 2, close."

"we'll see what we can do, jack. we'll get with recovery and see if we can get the agent out there $n the pacific when you come back. by golly, let's see. in professional basketball, the nicks beat the milwaukee bucks 110 to 102, and billy casper :s leading the masters after 54 holes with a 208, _nd spring football practice is in full swing. and that's about all the news we got; the updated plan of the day for you guys, tileuniform will be service dress inflight coverall garments with swords and medals, and tonight's movie shown in the lower equipment bay will be john wayne, lou costello, and shirley temple in the ""the flight of apollo 13."" 0ver."
okay. 00 00 30 24 cml° ... down there?

"15, this is houston, and we're all set up for the voice check."
okay. let me get the jettison bag out of the way.
"okay. well, we - you might check it this way, jack. line up the star denebola and rigel - say again, regulus; i'm sorry, regulus - denebola and regulus. and then, on that line, go perpendicular to that line right above ri - right above regulus, and that should be the s-ivb. it forms one point of a right triangle with denebola and regulus."
"roger. the delta-v test was good, and the null bias was 1.0."
whoa.
okay. let me make sure i got this set up right.
yeah. okay.
"and, ken, i've got one more flight plan update for you."
"okay; here comes the logic, on, houston."
okay; i can do that.
roger.

"no, let me - let me look at it a second. here we - here we are."
"apollo 16, if you read, omni charlie."
thirty-one seconds.
yes.
"okay, houston; 15. sim door jett. - 3, 2, 1 -"
"well, jack, you're turning into a very trained weather observer besides being a geologist."
"buzz, this is houston. you're cutting out on the end of your transmissions. can you speak a little more closely into your microphone? over."
i'm not going to get very far from you.
"okay. and as i look around, the mass spec is - oh, it looks like about - not quite in - the cover. it looks like maybe it's the cover that's j_mmed. yes, in fact, it is the cover that's j_mmed. see? l0 02 16 9'( c'c roger, al. we copy. that was most unexpected news."

"okay, let me give you one more try on it. well, that time it didn't ._. it. ail i did was go up to 1 slash 2 and the alarm came on."
"okay, geno, we got that. it sounds good."
let me cheek that.
"the only thing we need to advise you before you go on here is to tape the caps on your long core stem, both ends of it, before you depress."

roger. 4900 closing at 5.
"i'm not sure you can in here, but they do it in p27."
"okay, step 1, we'd like to know - you - you can give us these afterwards, but the first step is to determine the status of the service module sector 1 ac 2 circuit breakers on panel 181. those are three circuit breakers. number 2 is to deter- mine the status of the pan camera mode switch. n,,mber 3, after these have been done, pan ca/_f_a mode, standby; power, on, t,1kback barber pole for 2 seconds, then gray, and then stereo. number _, pan camera mode, operate, t-l_back barber pole for -- 2 seconds, then gray. number 5, operate pan camera until msfn cues, or until beginning of the sleep period. and number 6, on msfn cue, pan camera mcde to standby; and, after 1 minute, pan camera power, off. 0ver."
"okay. tony, in my opinion, we probably should sam?le the edge of ray and we should go east maybe about 100 meters."
roger.
go ahead. over.
try it again with the kitchen timer.
"miracle of miracles. they don't want the short can. i'm not sure i understand that, jack, but they don't want the short can here, they say, i guess they're looking for volcanic today."

okay.
that's what i want.
"okay; it's not so much a problem entirely of just keeping track of things, but you just - once the guy starts putting that suit on, he commands the rezt of the volume in the spacecraft. that's - that a7lb is a real - real interesting operation. if we can use the lm for it, that'll help out a great deal."
okay.
"oh, manisehewitz. whew. lmp-e_ya there you go again."

that's in alignment only.
and 10 away from the moon.
yes.
"okay; real fine. i just saw a - part of these rilles - type things, and it's got a light-brown - well, dark-brown - it's almost a mare-type coloring - heading in the southeast-northwest direction. and it's down from - oh, yes, there's saenger, east of saenger yet. let me find it on my map."
"okay. don't change it all, al, to bravo 1. cycling several times through the middle."
"yes. there's a definite color difference between tra - and it almost looks like - if you could stand on color alone, the color from tranquiliitatis extends on over, and covers into - you know, kind of drapes over the edge and covers up part serenity."
"okay? ... 04 22 45 37 _ you've got it, babe."
we'll consider ourselves tweaked.
"by the way, gordy, you might tell bob walker, if he's around, that the cosmic ray, as far as i know, was untouched by human hands, at least on the moon. and it looked very very clean when i put it in the - put it back together."
there you go.
okay.
"okay, if at any time, _he voice quality goes down, our ]procedures, as i understand them described, will - i'll knock off or i'll take charlie's place here, and i'll knock off the observations and go to rscording. and other than that, charlie will be doing all the things that i was going to be doing. but, if you want us to record them in pen and ink at the same time, just give us a call."
"oh, it sure looks like it, gray outcrop. _d there's a bluish gray compared to the - the brown or tan gray of the massif side."
okay.
does it look to you like the 240 controller is (columbia) properly controlling the glycol evaporator outlet temp? it locks all right up here.
put ali the shades up and turn out all the lights inside.
okay.
in fact -
...... 2 meters to the west of the north line.
"boy, am i glad we didn't land out here! whew!"
"sounds good, dave. and we want to move in about 3 minutes. we're coming up against a hard stop here."
there's babcock out there.
yes.
okay.

no.
"okay. very good. well, we shut out the sun coming in from the other windows into the space- craft, so it's looking through a - the number 1 window, and there isn't any reflected light now. so, it ought to be a pretty good picture."
"els, auto."
- - all look good here.
"okay, i was just going to tell you about that ' . ,_ handover we just had, but i was a little late on the - on the ball. since we're fat on power and we'd kind of like 3o have s-band with you after blackout - we'd- we'd like you to delete the step on your entry checklist page 2-5, after ""begin blackout,"" it says ""power pm/_to off."" we'd like you to leave it on if you think of it. over."
okay; thank you. we'll do that.
"you work mighty hard, i'll tell you."
"roger, jim. i guess we're going to just kind of perk away here now. page 240"
"every - well, a lot of it's working, we've just got to try and see if we can't level this thing tonight. when you get off there, jack, i'll talk to you a bit about procedures for that. and in the meanwhile, it's my understanding - -"
okay. go ahead.
"houston, aquarius."
"okay, it's coming up."
"and, just out of curiosity, we got rid of the radar very nicely. it's hanging right in the middle of the - the forward digit is the docking light on the command module. can you believe that? i don't think it will hurt our sun check, but it'll sure make p52 ..."
crank it out about to 40 on the zoom. 0b 19 00 37 i_mp okay.

"roger. do not touch it right now, pete. which way is that pointing - relative to east-west?"
"okays, houston, could we proceed through malfunction number 6 here?"
lots of space. i've got the seat down and the struts off. i'm about to take this suit off.
"okay. well, i noticed that if i just - -"
"okay, smoke her over. i don't want to leave anything out."
we'd just like to have it - prefer tonight.
"okay, joe. i can find a position on the switch where i can turn the light out now - in neutral position on the switch, if you want to look at it. i've cycled the switch a number of times, and i think i've got the spot where the light will go off, and i'll turn it off for a couple of seconds here for you."
"charlie, can you hand me my - my spoon out of my temporary stowage bag over there?"
"yeah, you get - you're sitting on the hatch."
"it's not, huh?"
roger.
"okay, looks like i could use a new state vector, i too ·"
"okay, i've got my hands off it. it's standing there."
that sounds great.
"is it what? yeah, we're aos now. yeah."

"oh, okay. apollo 17 air-to-ground voice transcription 06 17 52 22 i_-eva yes. and they look like there are boulders up on the side of sculptured hills, except that they aren't nearly as big as those on the north massif. the areas where the boulder source is look like they're made up of boulders no bigger than a meter maybe; whereas, the north massif coulders are up to several meters. those boulder sources all seem to be up within a third of the height of the sculptured hills, just south of - just east of the massif - of the wessex cleft. here is a boulder track that crossed the slope. see that, geno?"
0op - oop. it landed on a slope.
"we're auto. at 8:58, plus-x _hrust and zero - 56, 57, 58."

okay. standing by.
okay. i - i - -

"ail right, i'm with you."
can you give an - give us an estimate of how many drips per second it is?
"there is another - there is another one, maybe a front, a little bit ahead of that cyclone that's now extending north-south. starts in the pack ice area and extends up - oh, about halfway from there to buenos aires - in the directiom of buenos aires. it doesn't look like a very major mass of air or frontal system. it may develop into something over the next couple days though."
what's that?
yes. the whole freaking deal broke ... those bags are ridiculous. and that teflon is terrible out there. it broke!
"i think we got enough ullage in there, in the tanks to -"
"roger. we're listening, and i hope everybody else down here will be getting with me so we can give it to you at the end, if anybody wants anything. go ahead."
maneuver yourself - -
ands i am going to try this side because i can get my overlap over here.

is that main b? is it run off main b?
okay.

"okay, ver - helmet and visor alined and adjusted."
okay. i think those things are going to be kind of hard to see. but we'll try.
"save the tv tapes for us, will you please."
i don't want to go into the sun if i can avoid it.
"okay, would you read off the azimuth now?"
"well, let's - if you don't want another sample, then we can go ahead."
"well, the big thing is, let's get those *** the boulder and then get in that east-west split. bob, i got an undocumented sample from the *** boulder track."
"okay; verify direct 02 is closed. okay; tunnel vent valve, lm/command module delta-p. okay, it's greater than 3.1. it's up around 3.6."

okay. okay.
"it really is. you know i saw that dirt day before yesterday at littrow, but, and i really haven't seen too much from orbit that i'd call really very distinct in color, until this one. but, boy, there's no question about this one."
houston. we're having to take drastic measures. our commander has lost his mind.
"bob-o, all tae blocks bigger than 20 centimeters that i've looked at up here are subfloor gabbro in appearance."

"roger, jim. and what we're going to do now is to drop up-link for 20 seconds, and you are to read and record the high gain antenna dials and any changes that occur there. then we'll bring up the up-link; and, at that time, we want you to require - reacquire high gain antenna on - on auto, narrow. okay? 01 12 54 l0 i24p okay. right now the yaw indicator is reading about 280."

thanks for that.
roger. copy.
- - z'll try and -
"yeah. tony, i think that - we're just sitting here trying to decide - recall, and i - right now the only impression is that you tended to sink in more up on stone mountain, which could be downslope movement of the particles, and - it was a - just very loosely consolidated up there. you - every- where you'd - you'd step, you'd - you'd sink in a couple of inches. and on the slopes around the lam it was the same way. and even, in fact, where we landed. up around the alsep side, it was very loosely consolidated and as you walked you could - your foot would leave quite a imprint. and once we had pretty well turned over the surface around the i/4and up on stone, it would look like freshly raked ground and - to me. stone mountain - smoky mountain or, excuse me, north ray wasn't like that at all. it was very thin regolith and, as we com- mented, yet we had a tough time raking because it was so rocky right un - within a couple of centi- meters of the top of the regolith. over."
okay.

that's it. don ev gloves. do a little grease in here.
"it - it's going to hit on the southwest corner of reinhold, ken."

that's about the best we can do.
how much - how much is sharply?

"yes, but that's not craters. you know what that is?"
"oh, i'll get it."

well - that means we have to change here.
"well, i just got on a headset. you never had a chance to - -"
okay i'm watchin
"that's all we need, go ahead and park on your 025. we'll give you an update when you are done."
"no, sir. well, m_ybe - well, you know, we're in an entirely different sun angle now, and it's not clear to me that we don't see different things. maybe john can take this thing and show you where it was ccming from, because i didn't see it."
okay. 06 00 36 08 ia_p-eva i'm probably just about out of film. why don't you check with my mag?
okay; it's in work.

"yes, they got the number."
"okay, now. let me tell you what we've been doing with this stuff. we've been using the gemini [?] bags and then dumping it into a big white bag. and it's all in there now, all mixed together, and nobody knows whose is whom's. and - and, further- more, we don't know when we dump that big white bag when - we know when we start to do it, but we don't know whenever it finishes. because you can't see the inside of the bag. you just don't have a feel for that. so, what you just do is you just let it run until you think you ought to quit and look and see if you've got particles on the out- side. and even after you quit, there's still par- ticles on the outside."
did you - did you this morning?
if they'd have had the same problems we had on apollo 8 - borman was going out of his mind - he'd have shot himself. l0 00 02 0h cmp i don't really blame him.
are you running a null bias check here?
"jack, would you get the battery charger, off, please. and we'll send you - -"
roger. you can't ask for much better than that. how about the burn time? did you notice?
"*** got hot in here, didn't it? okay; purge valve to depress; *** your circuit breakers."
no.

"oh, look what's in there."
"hey, beautiful. man oh man. that sounds like all that stuff's working good. outstanding. that's good - good to hear."
here you go. let me get it for you.
bugs me.
"roger. roll 165, pitch 060, yaw 338."
where's the top? i'll put yours on top.
"odyssey, houston. i have your final entry pad when you are ready."
"*** go off the central peak. now, let's see what happens if we set it right -"
okay.
you might have to help me to get back up.
that's what they tell me. w_t me to get it?
"i'm going to order pork and scalloped potatoes; i don't whether you do or not, but i am."
okay; let me get the etb up.
"okay. i just turned my flow back on, so it'll start to rise again."
"how's mine, charlie? 06 02 42 53 i/mp-eva yours is great. it did good."
"houston, america. the canister's changed."
"yes, still there, jack. ""godspeed the crew of apollo 17."""

roger. we're standing by.
what was that? (laughter)
"columbia is locked up on the high gain, houston. (columbia)"
it happens to everybody.
"okay, image motion is coming on -"
"okay. and, gene, your bag is hanging by one hook there. be careful, if you can."
we'll give you a weight here shortly.
okay; now staredby.

"that's a very good question. wait'll you drink it day and night for 2 weeks, and - and let me know what you think. and for lunch, too."
go ahead.
"okay. if we get the light on, then we're at 2 min- utes, and we'll work for about a minute to try to get the light on. and if we don't get it on by i minute, then we'll consider that we cannot get it on, and if we do get it on by i minute, we'll call up p47."
yes.
"yes, sir."
(laughter)
"the only - okay. let me give you that. i just was turning the page. i did have one comment; the first - the first frame on that antisolar sequence, i think is probably not part of the gegenschein experiment itself. i think that's more of this zodiacal light business. but it's a 5-minute ex- posure, and we took it with the spacecraft - let's say my head's down and nearly in the local horizontal. the camera was pointing 30 degrees down, and it looks to me like it would have had the moon in - in earthshine - in the field of view; so i suspect that that's not much of a - not a very good frame. the rest of the sequences went - went fine, and the pointing attitudes pointed us right at the places on the chart. and i have attitude errors on the antisolar sequence. i'll just give you the atti- tudes at the end, and restart it from the proper attitudes. it was 165, 257, and 354. the second part of step 4 was 167, 258, 357. the attitudes in step 7: 169, 264, and 0. attitudes in step 10: 164, 275, and 359. magazine zulu zulu has 15 exposures taken."

and i'd roll that downhill - -
"okay, go ahead."
it's reversing.
how's your tracking exercises?
keep - keep looking.
"okay, p41."
"frame 31, bob."
"yes, i did, joe."
"boy, that's all - all t - all - all the sections are like that first one, pull it - right out of the ground. but i don't think that's true. 05 01 37 52 i_p-eva i tell you, this ain't the cleanest place i've ever been in my life. ooh. dust is everywhere. 05 01 38 19 imp-eva okay, last one, tony."

glad to hear that. 06 05 22 52 c_vp - - off and up came the sum.
i have a tpi tig when you guys want to compare (columbia ) them.
"now you're stuck down there, aren't you? no you're not. seems like you ... i may be going nuts talking to that moving machine over there."
"okay; ken says he looked at it several times during the evening, and it's been there most of the night."
"okay, i guess."
"we're getting that, john."
"you want us to tape it again, bob? *** with the tape?"
what do you want to do with it?
"roger, jack. we're still looking at 137 miles and doppler's confirming it. we will have a good update after 67 hours."
"say again there, jack."
"and houston, jack is showing fred the procedures before we start up."
how about that.
"c, full scale high; d is full scale high; a is full scale high. that baby had a full load."
"drop it a little more, dick. that's too ... about 18."
"okay; real fine. we had a good picture of jim there for a minute. i have the lift-off plus 8 pad, fred. if you're ready."
"i believe so, from my charts here, but let me doublecheck that. that is affirmative. tommy just gave me the up on that one."
roger.
"houston, 17."
"stand by 1 on that, jim. okay, jim, as far as we can tell right now, the ptc looks as good as any ptc we've ever seen in a csm, so we're going to go with what we've got."
"okay, mass spec on standby. yes, that's verified on standby, joe."
okay. very good.
"15, this is houston. we'd like to have manual on the high gain whenever one of you.has a chance to get there. no need to answer."
that's the understatement of the year.
"okay. i'll tell you a little something about vasco da gama later on. another easy item here, you're going to come up on a bat charge - i guess bat b charge - starting at 239 hours, and we'd like to delay that to 244 hours, please."
ask them if they can read the numbers.
"somewhere after tli, i know i get down there and turn that baby - that waste vent off."

"it's nice to see friends. 04 09 26 56 cdr-i_m okay, houston. we can use this one, but we don't _ have the noun 88 for it."

"and i guess the message is there, ken, just shoot the center."
"okay, i'm out."
is it clear?
get it with this real easy. here's a whole big - we ought to take that just as is.
"there's a big chunk where i've got - i can't g_t it out, though; it's buried in a rock - a very - oh, half an _neh elongated - i can't see whether they are colorless or not, but they are certainly reflective crystals. see that up here? see right there?"
"well, why don't you just take a 5-second one then?"
"well, you have to remember on the seismometer, on at least the one for jack's call, the s-ivb had just clobbered the seismometer, and - and that there was something small impact that when the - it was in the mud, you wouldn't have seen it."
huh?
"oh, well. i like to talk."
mark cmp.
not interested in what he's doing. you'd like that more than this.
"we're looking real close at water usage profiles, and right now things are kind of swinging toward leaving the imu powered up and powering down the lgc, but we'll have more word for you shortly. and we recommend for sleeping that you leave one guy on watch. we recommend you don't make any urine dumps if you can help it, because it'll make the debris problem worse than it is now. and we have some items that you might want to transfer to the lm, some towels, some penlights, fecal bags, uts. and do you have any more items that we can help you out with at the mcxnent?"
"yes. i'm going to put it in a seat pan now. _md then i - then, why don't you put your bag in here. _ here, let me have - let me have it. i'm going to put your bag in there. your carrier is awful loose, and i don't want to lose that bag. put this on a handtool carrier. 06 02 l0 31 l_p-eva what's in there? rock?"

"okay. as i say, we'll come back up and let you copy down some of those specific words again tomorrow, before you get involved. the second long one con- cerns clarification of the mass spec behavior, when it fouled up about 12 hours ago. and they're asking us, to ask you the following questions, to try and f clarify what - what was going on. first of all, was the t-]kback ever one-half barber pole during the extend, while attempting to recycle for retraction? over."

roger; that's adjusted correct.
early?
don't read you.
"right. once that thing isn't watertight anymore, you'll get leakage into that container and that'll all come out those holes."
"okay, understand."
"jim, in that control mode, that sounds lij_ethe best way to go. the only thing you'll have to do is to get attitude hold in the ags, and so before you start to maneuver, you'll have t_ bring the ags up, and get a 400 plus all zeron in there, and then ags will respond in yaw when you go to mode control. that is, ags will con- trol your yaw in mode control and your pitch and roll can be taken care of in pulse with a ttca. after you get in attitude, then, you'll have to re-do an ags body axis aline which is 400 plus 5, then go back to 400 plus all zeros again."
"okay. when you get a chance there, we would like you to read the ed voltage, both a and b. 02 05 44 43 l55o exactly the same thing as yesterday, 37 volts, tony, both of them."

roger. understand.
"no, it - its depth-to-diameter ratio was about par for the - for the course up there. and it had a slightly raised rim, and the rim may have been somewhat higher than - than others. but i wouldn't be able to distinguish that specifically. it - it was a rather standard-appearing crater, until we walked up onto the rim, and it was extremely soft. and, of course, we only sampled one edge of the rim there. we didn't get any circumferential sampling on it. so it might have been a - a unique part. but it looked pretty uniform all the way around. _-_ 08 20 59 21 cc roger."
"let me do that, charlie."
"that's affirm. better worded, it would have been maneuver and hold in attitude for moon view, et cetera."
there's - there you go. hang on. you're going to burn in now.
"i was almost in the right a_titude to start with. hey, now, would you guys, in a little bit, not look? it sure is nice to get somewhere more than a minute before you have to be there. and we're all set up. i got the window shade up and the camera installed, and we're all ready to go."
okay.
yep. sure could do that.

"it was an auto ignition. it was an auto shutdown. i think any comments during the burn are on the tape. but, to me, it was probably the smoothest and quietest sps burn i ever remember."
- - ...
"and mine's verified, and your pump, on."
...
"0k_j. 04 17 38 38 i24p pga is 4 8 and coming on down. houston, we are ready to start our watches."
i'm right here in the middle of the page.
"okay, ed. you want to go from normal to bypass, now?"
"stand by, jack. we'll get the word on that."
"stand by l, fred."
dang right. where are - which way should we pitch to get to you?
"roger. eagle. we concur. stand by on the gimbal angles. and also, eagle, while we've got the comm,nd module direct 02 on there, there's a possibility that your cabin relief might relieve if we get up around cabin pressure of about 5.4 or 5.5."
yes_ but i didn't get a picture of it. okay.
roger. and delete it at 11.
"roger, pete. your thrust looks good."
yes.
let me get up on this ***
roger.
...
"go ahead, jim."
"what you're looking at, joe, is the commander has removed the hatch and is proceeding to stow it."
"well, i can show you a picture of the con_mander. he's fairly colorful."
"okay, why don't we get that reference soil and look around for a little bit smaller boulder to turn over."
"okay, sir, and if you'll give us accept, we've got a state vector at this time for you. 08 13 49 07 _ okay, you have it."
"something took care of those panels, i'll say that for it."
"okay, the rendezvous radar operate heater should be closed at this time."
get your picture?
"and, 17, we need you guys in the lm in 15 minutes, 15 minutes because of oxygen constraints."
okay. you might run that by the cpcb and see if they approve our in-house ...
i':really is.
mark. bright flash down at the right center of the right eye ... 02 o1 51 1i cmp mark. _ dull fuzzy spot in the outboard center of the left eye.
i forgot to look at the objectives for this station. i hope we're meeting them.
assemble and mount in the left-hand window ...
roger. for the number 5 window. that'll be - every time you pass 230 degrees in roil. over.
"15, go ahead."
how you read b simplex?
roger. off and standby.
okay. i'll do a verb 76 enter with the mode control att hold and then 30 clicks of right yaw to set the maneuver.
"that's affirmative, ken."
"jack, that almost looks like bedrock over exposed in there. see that?"
roger; we copy.
"i can - i can do it over the src; it's all right, john."
"that was like gunpowder, just like the boys said."
"okay, by the way, mag lima lima is empty. 165 frames showing there. started mag mike mike with frame number 95. finished the orbital science at 142. took the crazy camera at f/5.6 at 1/125. when i got ready to change to f/5.6 at 1/250, i looked at the crazy thing and it was setting at f/ll. maybe those first frames in there, maybe they can develop them a little different or something and still bring - get them to come out."
okay. comm check with me and houston.
okay. will do.
"casper, houston. we'd like for you to try, for our data, one more yaw primary - yaw secondary g&n servo loop check - gimbal check."
"go ahead, ken."
yes. it sure is.
"and point it right - it'll - and point it to the leb, and we can all three get in the pictttre."
i got it. i'm sorry. i thought you weren't using it. i was just going to get this one over here.
"that's right. we want - let's see. 25.6 is normal, so we go to 25.7 to back it up."
okay.
"yes, okay. well, (laughter) a1 made the point that it's all changed anyway, because normally i bring on hank - the second bank in 3 seconds, and he doesn't have to worry about it. he's concentrating on the start transients and everything. so it's a complete change at any rate, and i think it might be a tad better to go to the 5 seconds with a1 on the circuit breaker."
i know it. should have parked right beside it.
and did the contingency sample get in there?
okay. the alpha/x-ray cover is ccming closed.
roger; f/4 - - c_ - - 1/250.
"yeah, i've noticed that."
"that's correct, ken."
"orion, you can configure for normal rcs configura- tion now."
"amen there, gene. amen."
"okay. on the ops configuration, we wanted the ops connector locked in the stowage plate and turn the ops actuator to on ...."
"yeah, it's pretty good. yeah, it's good water. it really is."
ail right.
every - every time?
"and, john, when you get to the first setting, i've some new settings for you."
"bob, i just hit the control stick. it's locked again in roll. i may have bumped it a little bit."
yes.
send a crew alert or something?
yes. delta and echo coming in.
"houston, aquarius."
yes. i think so.
"ken, john and charlie are still at north ray and they have found some basalt ctast."
yes.
"go ahead, houston."
"okay, karl. we're coming up over serenitatis now. we're a]most over le monnier at the present time, and we can see the littrow area just out in front of us. and it is, in fact, about three different shades. you can see the - in the upland area, and particularly what looks like down in the valleys, a darker color, and it does look like it's a light powdering- or dusting-over of the entire area. and then, as you get out further into mare serenitatis, there's another layering which is a little bit lighter in color. and then, out at the last edge of the wrinkle ridge, out beyond that is the last layer, and the rest of serenitatis looks fairly - fairly light in color. so i'd say that the - the - the centeral - central part of serenitatis is light, out beyond the first wrinkle ridge is a darker layering, and we're not up close enough to see what it is yet, and then as you get up into the highlands around le monnier and littrow area itself, there's what - what appears to be a - a light dusting of dark material, and it cer- tainly looks volcanic from here. off to - to the left of that to the south, we can pick up sulpicius gallus pretty clearly right now."
"okay. about an f/8, i'd say, huh? 0k 07 52 28 cdr yes, that's a good guess; 1/250th, f/8."
roger. at least almost.
like whitish rock?
"okay, 380."
this doesn't sound like a sim.
"that's weird, that big one right sver there, _1."
we'll get to that. conftde'n l day:
okay.
"okay. a couple of thin_s, jim. one is that you can use the ttcas to maaeuver, but you're going to save a lot of fuel if you'd try mini_jm impulse. so, that might be a better recommendation. the other thing is, we'd like to give you a go before you dis- able the plus s - x thrmsters, and before you do a verb 76, and mode control to att hold. over."
"okay. i'm back in min, bob."
"aquarius, houston."
(laughter) it didn't bother me that badly.
"yeah, there's one of those black rocks like we got out of south ray. 07 00 52 26 t_3_-eva yeah."
(laughter)
i knew his attitude would change once they got him here.
...
"- - is the point by buster; you should be coming up to the edge of spook, the eastern edge of it."
"apollo ll, houston with a little recovery force information. over."
okay. i'm not advocating that you do.
okay.
"well, i had a good prime crewman that taught me all i know."
"_lat's the lpd, babe? 04 12 11 21 _p lpd, 41."
that's got to be psychological. 06 l0 16 57 c_p (laughter) it sure is.
"there's something basic about telling time that - seems to be very difficult. okay, i'm at attitude, charlie."
"orion, this is houston. at the present zime, it looks like you will be coming in 16,000 feev high and about 20,000 feet south,"
"well, there's some stuff behind it, but i can't get at it. i'm not - i just can't. i - i could reach it with the moving the orange drinks, but if i do, i don't know what i'm gonna do with them."
start unzipping these suits.
"and whoever is giving us 557, so - yes. w"
okay; this is al. 3.75 and 45 ]percent; and on min - medium flow; and i'm comfortable.
*** a scoop of it. upon the top.
"okay, buzz. the first item is that we have indica- tions that your landing site obliques are not in the proper position. if you'll check, we chink that the intermediate-scale landing site oblique is stowed in the csm lunar landmark book. we think that the large-scale landing site oblique is stowed in the back of the _4 lunar surface map book. over."
and it's tight.
"alpha/x-ray experiment covers, close."
roger. we agree with that.
"right. over to the right on the edge of plum there, looks like there might be rock with some phenocryst in it. if you're over that way, you might look around and see if you see something like that. it may have just been dust on it."
you know what i need?
i don't either.
...
roger; 40 and 31.
...
go ahead.
"okay. 1:45, 75 ... los at - ... 34 ieonfide )ay"
"okay. okay, let me go - scout - smoke over the area. okay. okay, let me go - scout - smoke over the area. okay."
"yes, sir. what does 4 degrees equai in miles from the earth?"
roger. copy.
"yes, minus 10.3."
"let's hope nothing's wrong with the lm or anything, ... that baby protected - -"
"okay. second row, close the first six on the left through the isol valve and open all to the right of that."
yes_ but you know we got two tenths.
"trans control power, up and on."
"hello, houston; 15. how are you?"
yaw is 356.2.
okay.
forward omni.
"well, it's serial number 1007. it's in the ii-6 rockbox area. i don't know how you tell whic_a one's the number, which number's what. c_ just a second, i can't get _he other one c±osea. no. i - i don'z mean that one. i mean vhe b-5 rockbox."
"oh, i don't know. hey, bob, 55 yankee is an exotic-looking rock i found about 5 meters south of the neutron flux hole. *** gray - possibly gray basalt. it's just that there aren't many of them around here, and so i picked it up. *** a little again."
"no. no better than you can looking at the photo- graphs. there's a lot of light material up there that has what looks like dark material sticking through it. it looks that way very obviously - looks like there's rocks and - it's still hard to determine if those are rocks or if those are shadows, but i've seen it a couple of times looking back from the - from west to east, and it still looks like - hard - shadow, so it must be our - it must be dark material or a block at least, rather than shadows."
okay.
"okay. oh, that's why it didn't - that helps. i turned it off so i wouldn't keep you awake."
"go ahead, jack."
i have hydrogen tank number 2 heaters off; i have oxygen tank number i heaters off.
"okay; 03:30, and we're at 190 h-dot; 30,000, looking great."
...
i think it'll stay.
okay.
"ok_f, hank. the first part of that - i was looking out the plus-x. now i'm turning over on my right side and i'm looking out the y-axis now - out win- dow 5. and i'll see if that's going to make any difference."
"one of the questions we asked ourselves years ago, when we mapped the copernicus area, was were we really seeing dark mantling deposits on some of the massifs cf the carpathians, and looking al it obliquely here, it - some of those areas that we've mapped as da_'kmantling are distinctly brownish gray versus the normal tan gray of the - of most of the carpathians. it looks like - and it's about the same color as - extrapolating - as the dark mantle around sulpicius and taurus-livvrow."
"casper, houston. we're about 2 minutes from los, and when you come around next time, in that ren- dezvous, just come up on the best omni, and then we'll get high gain from there."
"dave, we want you to verify the ctv switch, on, please. and that the high gain's pointed in tv remote."
okay. this is beginning to sound like the sim that we ran not too long ago.
2_y don't you get over on your side?
roger. power down until you get an amperage of 10 amps less than what you got now. over.
see it?
we just got a change on that. let's keep the asa closed.
hmm.
you have it.
got it?
"ken, how do you read now?"
"okay, houston. we're in pcm high. how do you read?"
"okay. you're loud and clear, ron. how me?"
00 the ... the ags ... get that stuff. god damn it! i don't care what anybody - -
okay. okay.
roger.
"no, no comments on it. and - i guess we're back to the position we were in before, that the thing is sort of half barber pole. and when i go back out with it - fiddle with it a little bit, the barber pole goes full up and then comes down about half-way again."
"oh, actually, i feel - i've been feeling fine. just - none of us have felt like eating. and that's probably normal, and everybody's eating more now, and we'll start getting to sleep, i think."
"well, that would be my guess, also, but can you guess at it? okay, if you can't, forget it."
yes. because we're in sim bay attitude now. 03 12 21 b1 cdr ... a and b.
roger.
that son of a bitch is all full.
"okay. go ahead, vance."
"let's get where we cap.get that 90-degree picture, too; so we want to get on the - really ought to get on the sun side. let me get that slab right there, though, to start with. i can get that one off. well, there's no - let's go over on the sun side because we can't really photograph it. t_ i.]:_ '_8 l?ip-eva okay. i got to get out of here first."
"okay. once again, in average g, i'll get the engine arm. you confirm the ullage, i'll get the pro. i'll back up the ullage and get the start."
which way do you want me to turn?
"okay, don."
"gordo, we're just finishing chow and doing a little cleaning up, and i'm doublechecking the stowage and so forth. but we do have a minute. is there by any chance any late news? anything going on today that might be of interest?"
what?
yes.
all i can say is it's better than walking.
"nobody - by golly, put those there. there's a couple of good towels."
"okay, houston. go with the contamination cloud photography update."
- - that doesn't have a blocky rim.
okay.
"you got a heading for me at the rover, is 017 good?"
"apollo 15, this is houston. over."
oh.
okay. let me stop and get the rear steering going.
on time!
is that mine again?
okay.
"okay, you should have 2 psi."
yep.
"houston, tranquility. i used capella in the last (tranq) sighting, and it's a good ways near the edge. a good ways away from the center of detent 4. i'm wondering if it would pay any to use alpheratz, star number 1. it might be a little closer. however, it would delay things a little, since i'd have to designate the radar out of the way. over."

roger. that's fine with us. and p52 in that attitude.
this was i can get a running shot of ... - right in the middle of it - let me get you - get them both in it. tape 9?a/l_
"i'm trying to remember who the guy was that kept saying, ""whatever you do, don't get dust on the gnomon. it 05 13 52 33 cdr/imp (laughter)"
"i knew you could, but you could - you could do it ... perfect here, or you could ... now can you get it started?"
"and it shows up as - yes. it - i'll take two of them. first, i'd better get the dark slide out. the way the sun is shining on the darn thing, and it shows up as a bright - i'll be darned! that's amazing! it shows up as a bright ring, just like we got it drawn on the map. you know, you - you get a brighter albedo all the way around to the top of the ring. that was frame 120 through - or 122 through 124 on mag oscar oscar."
"okay, ken. you there?"
"no, if you can't play me ""riding old paint,"" why, i don't want you singing either."
okay.
"yes, and i'll get the comprehensive later, if we have a chance."
"sun looks the same on this side of the moon as the other side. sure weren't back there very long. because we're going fast, i guess, no? don't know why it was. yes, because we're going by it; that's why, we're not orbiting it. it's a lot faster than - yes, 2800 feet per second more - what do you want? 03 11 22 16 cml° look at the time."
©kay. the big-rock bag should go in the hand tool carrier.
oh.
"about 15 minutes or so ago, we noticed - or detected a transfer on your ecs flow control proportioning valve from number 1 to number 2 and we were wondering if the switch, ecs radiator flow control auto switch, is still in the auto position. and if it is in the auto po - -"

"about 19 hours. oh, you're talking about surface stay time. i'm sorry; i'm giving you eva time. well, hang on a second. we'll have to figure that one out."
okay.
"hey, refresh my memory on the missicn rules there, ken, could you? if it doesn't start on bank a, do we start on bank b?"
"thank you, al. i'm not doing any better."
what the heck? i said i was going to do the fuel cell - -
now - it's sure not. i mean the material is not white. it's just the same as it -
yeah.
oh.

they are all gray. are we gonna ...?

do you get the idea this thing rocks every once in a while?
"roger, dave. very slightly more to the right so we can watch the rover come down. looks good. looks good."

okay. i'm stable now. c._ okay. now let me come 'apto you.
"ed, this is houston. we're showing your feed- water pressure going up. you ought to be in business shortly."
man. that must be it.
"okay. 05 01 29 07 ia_p-lm primary water, closed. forward hatch - turn that water off. cdr-i24 do you have to turn the primaries or just the secondary, bob?"
and the laser's off ...
yes.

"me, too. (laughter)"
okay- -
"houston, apollo 11. out of curiosit__, on those 70-mm cameras, we figure we e_osed around 300 in the lm and around a th_usand in the command module; and both cameras - or all the 70-mm cameras worked just fine."
"we left - we took our helmets out of them, and we handed them all back to you, dick."
01:30. 02:30 -
okay.
"okay. t_lking about the america though, your consumables - you're b.8 percent high on rcs quantity. on the 02, well - all the points of the three tanks have fallen between the - the two sets of lines on your graph with a total result as on 02 you're about l0 pounds below the average quantity expected. however, your trend is paralleling the lines and that's of absolutely no concern. on hydrogen, by best guess is you're probably a little bit high, total. your tank 1 is right on the line; t_k 2 is - oh, about 6 or 7 percent high; and t_k b is about 4 percent high, so you're fat on hydrogen. over."
okay. ll 00 32 bt cc i think that's another great example of esp at work.
and my plss 02 is on.

yes.
we got it. _n fident j_ day 6
"roger, jim. copy."

"okay. will do. i'll take them again. i'm going to take a few pan's first, houston, if that's okay. it'll take about an additional 3 minutes."
"this is the easist part of the rock in the world to work. man, here's a big - here's a big white clast. there's one on top about a foot and a half across, and here's one - must be 2 feet across - 3 feet. and that's in the blue-gray."
"yes: inside the crater. and it also looks like it carries on across. as i get a little bit closer, i'll see if it carries on across or not. this can't be shadow. you can still see the darker ennulus around - peirce. peirce bravo's also got a dark annulus around it. in peirce bravo has only - goes out to about a half a crater diameter, though."
yes.... 06 23 52 bo cdr-eva brush you off.
"okay. gee, it's nice to sit down, isn't it?"

"ron, i've got your pan camera photo pads when you're ready. cml° okay. i just happen to be ready to copy."
"roger. dave, that's exactly the picture we built from your verbal description there and that's the reason - one of the reasons we're going to omit station 3. we think that there probably is not at least a sharp debris flow down the side."
"that's a good readback, jim."
"apollo ll, this is houston. for your ilformatjoo the all star game has just ended with tae nat: nal league winning 9 to 3 over american. o_er."

"no, i'm done, jack."
"okay. number one, we want to retrieve the uht. and i quote, ""tap sharply"" - that's ""sharply"" on the gimbal, which is the center section there, the little square metal piece in the middle - tap sharply on the gimbal with the uht, and then re- verify the level on the lsg. we'll check response here in mission control after you've done that."
okay. just loose?
okay. copy that.

"i must have one of the planets right up there above, right in that area, too. does that sound right? that's around nunki."
okay. you want me to trim the excess material that's sticking off here; trim it at the edge of that canister? or do you want any excess left ;' over?
"roger, al."
"houston, challenger. we'll both be off the air briefly here as we swing into getting our suits and lcgs off. the commander presently has his suit off, and i'll start on mine."

"there's the barber pole; l, 2, 3."
very interesting. which window are you looking out?
"(laughter) oh, you know how to get to a guy."
"say, just a second. let me check the test meter."
"houston, falcon. go."
okay.
"i think that's swp right there, jack."
"okay, about 5 feet."
don't underrate it.
"okay. 04 20 311 15 i2,1p okay. ... six frames per second. 04 20 04 36 f_fip i can see that this is going to be a considerably _owe. process than i expected"
"no, but - i mean that - -"
"aquarius, houston. we'd like you to go ahead and yaw 90 for the ptc. keep a close eye out on your middle gimbal angle. you're about 30 degrees from gimhal lock, and we'll call you an omni switch halfway through the maneuver. over."
"well, i'm going to have to let it have - a little extra ltv."
aquarius_ houston. go ahead.
"al, i want to change lightweights with you. i'm going off comm."
(laughter)
"and, about 238:50, we want gamma ray shield, on."
"okay. is there anything else i could get? 05 06 4'_/2 cc i don't believe so, jack. that's one that when you get to that step, if you do get something else, we will be standing by to see that you see. the whole scheme is to go to standby."
"yes, they got plenty to say, jack. but they're down here and they can say it, and i think what you ought to say up there is what you're familiar with and just confine it to that."
yeah.
okay.
and you're on your own.
i think we're using the lm right now.
"understand. and then go to ptc, huh?"
sounds pretty good.
"do you want the gnomon? 05 13 37 23 3c okay. and, al, did - did you mention either' seeing a white boulder or a brown - a brownish-gray boulder earlier?"
challenger - understand a stay for t-1. good.
should have aos momentarily. you've done the landing gear. did the dap.
yes.
"ah ha, i got the old helmet and gloves on."
... bit like zodiacal light. it keeps going out farther and farther. we'll talk about it a little more later.
i know it. down and right.
i just can't get my arm up for it.
go.
okay.
"i'm ready, enter."
"still a little bit too much, but that's not bad."
the only guys that don't understand space flight are not the flight planners (laughter).
"roger, jim. we - we'd like to have a - a complete check there, and don't - don't reset that circuit breaker, incidentally."
"delta i and bravo 2 is what it calls for, and that's what was on."
hmm.
okay.
"and suit circuit relief is a close. close it. 07 01 05 40 lmp-l_ okay, it's going closed. closed."
"okay, gordy. i just spun up america for you."
"okay, over the top. minus - o8 23 53 38 ct_ ..."
"have you got the telemetry, high? 04 13 15 05 i_ i will in just a second."
*** how we can ret that in.
"(humming) how long have i been out, houston?"
"roger, houston. understand going around the back side. i'll check on that biomed harness. i may have loosened it exercising. and understand you want the grmma ray boom retracted at 129:20."
roger ....
roger. we were just about to send you up some items of information pertaining to the burn. are you ready to copy? 01407 43 13 lmp stand by.
"okay. the earth went by there, jack, at lt'd about 18 degrees."
"okay, and i've got a plus 1.5, a minus .2, and a plus 1.9."
"houston, how do you read? over."
i've heard more about this p20 on this side of the tunnel this mission than i ever could have.
okay ....
okay. go ahead.
i'll get up here to attitude.
stand by 1.
you still ... - -
"roger. houston copies, and we'll - -"
good.
pitch should be 7 degrees at the roll - not quite.
"uplink squelch, enable."
"that's a couple of meter black rock. houston, we've talked about that one when we passed by it the first time. that's the same rock that - that we saw on the - on the rim. that's the same class of rock, i would think, zhat we - that was that big house rock."
what's off?
"okay, the little indicator - - gu 21 08 15 cc six frames per second was nominally 16 minutes, _d we ran for almost 20. 0_ 21 08 21 cdr okay, the little sall indicator was - indicating emp%y. ©kay_"
okay.
"oh, yes."
i've got - i've got two whole reels of color stereo.
*** off?
- taking a look at the pretty scenery.
okay.
better start getting our ... tei.
"oh, my; oh me. how you coming?"
that's right.
... to 15.
"now, i think this is the spot, pete, right here. f"
yeah.
roger.
yeah. i got them.
"apollo 11, houston. coming at yea with the p37 block data. over. 00 _0 59 28 lmp okay."
"no. we have b and a, and - and that one, and there's another one that was good in there."
"am i still in your field of view, houston?"
"yes, sir."
"apollo 13, houston."
sure do; go ahead.
"go ahead, houston."
and high gain to auto.
okay. can we skim where the - can we skim where the pristine sample was?
"apollo 11, houston. (goss net 1) tape 124/4"
yes.
"roger, we got it."
all right.
"no, this is a big crater. i% - it's 40 - 561meters across. it has a fairly sharp crater in the south edge of it, which is 20 - 30 meters across."
"okay. we copy. does the ridge system cross the color boundary, ron, in crisium?"
yes.
"fdai - ordea_ fdai 1, orb rate; 2, inertial."
okay - bruce. this is ed. we both read you loud and clear. a1 called back but you could apparently not read him.
okay. coming up on 2 minutes; i'm changing over here.
it's all yours.
go.
"okay. bob, so far, the rover looks pretty good."
"okay. it's 8 miles north, and i'll lose it at 30 degrees. okay; so that'll be pretty quick."
"yes, go ahead."
okay - -
"yes. i've already put those in there. that's why i wanted to get the right bag. __ 06 23 00 10 cdr-eva yes, that's everything i've got. 06 23 00 lb lmp-eva well, we've got the ses - a sesc in here - that has not been used - of course, there're remaining caps."
"you're really putting in all your hours on it, are you? glad to hear that. -- 05 06 53 39 cmp got to keep in shape."
"what else can we do, charlie? 03 22 21 31 i24p nothing. let's just wait until we get aos and get the coremup. then we do the e-memory dump."
"you with us, bob?"
"let me get it with this - it isn't any trouble, john. 06 02 23 22 i_p-eva man, i - the matrix is so fine-grained, i can't tell, tony, but it's definitely got a blue cast to it and there - there are inclusions of a whitish - it looked llke plage to me."
"oh, i must be getting old."
"well, you're going to have to put on your helmet - it's really over that way a little bit more, be- cause i got to get into the hatch to get it out. apollo 17 air-to-ground voice transcription"
only 3 seconds difference between us.
but you'll probably be coming straight in by the time you get down to pitchover.
"okay, coming up...."
"that's your meal[ you're getting behind, john. oh, what canister was that i was gonna change? i was gonna put 16 into a - no, 13 in a-3."
stand by. we're checking.
and america is now out of 800 feet.
"copy that. l_p-eva we're on a pretty good slope, geno."
"we're there. now, let's - if you can - okay, right over there, and maybe i can get a rock with it_ see that batch of rocks there?"
all right. get your - get your shutoff checklist out.
"aquarius, one idea on managing the omni antennas. it might make it easier on everybody if we disabled the uplink squelch and managed the antennas by switching when we hear the noise. over."
okay.
you've got a block right ahead of you.
"okay. we copy that. l_-eva that's the blue-gray, bob, with the inclusions in it. now the blue-gray, the more you looked at it, it looks like a- -"
"well, i can; my darn - both hands are all -"
"okay, babe. let's go to the al - okay, bob. i owe you a - a bias reading."
"that's right, so have we. what is it?"
"it - it looks like this big one over here. you know, it might be that the - these are - might be pieces of the projectile. i don't know. because it doesn't look like - it's not subfloor."
okay.
"okay, ron, how do you read now?"
i'll bring your camera out.
"go ahead, houston."
bulk sample is just being sealed.
"yeah, charlie; 5 to 10. more like 10. 06 22 24 _3 _,_-eva yeah. okay, tony. we're about maybe a half-a- crater diameter to the northeast of - of palmetto, about a 10-degree slope, and the boulder population is about 5 degrees here. and the small cobbles have just about disappeared. very smooth regolith, except for these 20- to 30-centimeter boulders, which are not very numerous. we're really moving out downslope at about 12, 15 kilometers an hour."
"yes, b in auto."
"okay; oxygen. you have remaining 44 po_mds in the lm. at a usage rate of 0.36 pounds per hour, that leaves you 120, or 1 2 o, hours of oxygen. okay. next, rcs. rcs a stands at 6 2 percent and b at 6 2 percent. we only ex_,,u_%2 percent to be used for the ptc_ so you'r_ in good shape for rcs. next, dps delta-v. you h_w _ llq0 feet per second remaining. and, fina]]y, csm eps. we estimate that you have 99 amp-hours. that's an estimate. and that's it. over."
16; roger. can y(ssv2)
"you're 5 by, hank."
"suit fan 2, closed."
"okay. now these are the back room's best guess. that spook sampling may be compromised by that ray from south ray that you described, and since we're mostly interested in local cayley on eva-i, you'll probably have to spend a little time trying to differentiate between secondaries coming in from south ray and local material. you described most of the ray material as being very angular. one of the clues may be rounded blocks, for local material. at flag, again, you may have that same problem, since we couldn't see over there, we really couldn't tell, and we don't want you to feel bound to plum crater there at flag; if there's another place on the rim of flag where you're more likely to get local material, feel free to head for it."
that fender is really going to be a nuisance.
okay; thank you.
"computer's yours, 15."
"unfortunately, i can't see the_ ***"
"bob, _nfortunately, no. the main tracks are out into nansen, and we - i don't think we can get over there."
"11, houstojl. you sta:ted out right, and then the numbers you read back were correct; but i didn't get your comment in between there."
okay; go ahead.
i've got you at 4.7 miles.
this is what gets me.
"06:30, geno. it looks good, babe. 72. altitude is right on. h-dot is very close."
yes. yes.
"okay, i've got 50 percent. the flags are clear and 3-9."
"columbia, houston. i can give you some reacq angles for the high gain on the lm jettison attitude. then you can go there whenever you want to. the angles are pitch minus 50, and yaw zero."
"okay. delete item 5 down to the point where it says ""minus 15 minutes."""
okay.
yes. this should be your portion.
"okay, casper, you're coming up on t2 now in about 10 seconds. 0_ 0c 48 &4 cml° orion, casper. are you ready for rendezvous radar vhf range check? 04 00 _9 58 cc casper, houston. if you'll give us accept, we'll up-link your state vector and target load."
yes. that's a good one.
"okay. hey, maybe - let me get those two frags there from the center. give me - -"
there you go. it worked.
"that's affirmative. we need them closed to power the switches. next on panel 5, we want the eps sensor signal main a and main b circuit breakers closed. over."
"roger, jim. at 56 plus 50, start ""csm systems checklist, ivt to dm,"" and this is an item that's moved up from 57:20, by the way."
"(laughter) you know it's funny; all the simulating we've done, and they don't give us what we got up here."
okay. what? let's put the - let's put the soil in there with the ...
"boy, look at that black horizon; that's black."
"did you copy, gordy?"
"i got it with the rake. you want - i got to go get - why don't you take that and put it in my sack, and i'll go over and get the double core?"
"okay. and, dave and jim; this is houston, with a voice check."
"and h20 sep component light, on."
"i thought we launched a little bias, but i guess that's gone now. wetre a little higher than that."
i think i'm going to be forced to -
roger. we copy that.
"roger. verified. 04 08 21 39 l_? rate scale, 25 degrees per second. 04 08 21 42 c£r 25. 0_ 08 21 _3 lkp *** control, auto, cdr. 0_ 08 21 44 c_r auto, cdr. ' conft'd-[""t',im l"
i understand.
"i'm still pretty depressed at this point. 05 23 _3 36 lmp-eva oh, man, john. this is really a ray; it just goes right in to south ray."
"and, standby for the consumables."
we verify that. page 12.
roger.
"i thin}: that's where we put it, as a matter of fact."
"not a thing, dave."
"you know that sep isn't get much - well, it's getting a little on it, but those mirrors don't clean off as nice as the - as the lcru mirrors."
"houston, how we doing on the time line?"
"0.26, 0.25. okay, we're going thorough ga_e 3 and we're braking."
"gene, houston."
"well, i think that's - kind of pushing the rules."
yes.
it won't hold with all that weight in there. okay; i got your antenna.
you want us to stop one-crater dliameter short. 05 14 10 26 3c that's affirm; because some of the items coming up are the core and the trench.
"okay; they're locking up on me. hello, houston. this is casper bar [?] now. we did not do circ, and i'd like to talk about the tvc servo loops."
okay.
okay. okay; the third one says: what are your impressions of the distribution of the - the familiar subfloor gabbros throughout the eva-3 traverse?
"and we'll give you that word when we want you to do that. that's lgc only, not to power down the imu. but we'd like to have you hold off on that until we send you the word. over. la_c 4'2/4 fage 229"
...
all right we figure ... 274 and 0.8.
"how about something to drink, something like that?"
"roger. it's no big deal. the note here was, at that point, you're supposed to observe the current meters, and if there's no indication of a current flow in any tube, you tap the box gently along the - the axis, or parallel with the face, and then you allow the whole de - the whole lmit to lie motion- less for additional 3 to 5 minutes before proceed- ing. they're afraid there may be a bubble in one of the tubes, and you don't get a current."
mark.
"now, look, i'm going to yaw back to the left."
i don't know. how does - sounds good to me.
... (laughter). chamber pressure - -
okay.
... down here.
"okay. the lminspection attitude that you'll go to results in kind of a marginal view of the earth out of window l, about 60 degrees away from it, bore- sight line of sight. and we're - we can - what tape27/3 we've started to work on and if you wanted to do is you can go to kind of intermediate attitude, which will be the lm attitude except for roll which will be off by about 60 degrees, which will - will give you a good view of the earth out of window 1. and then when we get ready to do the lm entry, you can roll that additional 60 degrees to get to the proper attitude, if you wish. your choice. over."
then run the dac for 2 seconds.
okay.
(hlnnming) got the pins on it. going to unroll ... in the cable (humming; whistling). cml° it works. ah. good little vacuu_ cleaner we got (chuckle)· does that when it starts up. let me try it again. okay? watch the main bus b.
okay - take them.
want to do it on the minute?
"okay. on the side of the next page in the left column, on the side of a-8 in the bag, as you have there, with the additic_ of the core tube pole."
yes.
"yes, beautiful."
"i know you don't like him even - you don't even like him at home. i'll tell you, this has got to be absolutely sinful - too much fun to be ..."
"i read you, but there's a lot of noise in the background. 03 22 26 15 imp okay. we have primary evap activation time is 93:33:30, and we're standing by for the ags abort constants. over. or - let us do the steerable first and get - -"
okay.
"yes. yaw's coming - or roll's coming up for it, and we were going to burn."
"that was good marks there. this better come out good, or somebody is going to be mad. 0b 12 50 30 _p what about that patch? where - oh, there it is."
"0kay_ bob. l_m keeper of bhe iei%-hai:d side plus the m_ager of the f_'z__fl'-o .--__'&li here, so -cass !% ap."
two.
you coming in head down or up?
roger. 05 14 14 04 lmi° number 3.
"roger, 1i. under column a on page f2-20, line 5, line 05, the new data is 01042; line 07, the new data is 00256. skipping down to line 11, 00070; line 12 is 00042; line 13 is 77730. in cold,mn bravo, lines 3, 4, and 5, which are blank, should be all zeros for line 3; line h is 20017; line 5 20616. over."
"okay. twenty-two degrees, and looks like we've come up with a procedure for the attitude control on the upcoming burns. probably the ones that we'll use from here on out."
"yes. okay, watch. i'm going through it. _ lmp-eva okay. no problem."
sounded like parker has the duty. both monumental and epic.
"how's it doing now? 04 23 38 53 _p-eva nope. front's working, but the raar's not."
"well, everybody is thinking about it, and we'll come back with an answer on it later. right now i think the general feeling is that most people'd just as soon you not tamper with it unless you feel very strong about it."
"yes. and the other one's not even circled; it's just north of the - the one in the bottom, and that's the one that even shows up on here and the - impact-type, because it's got ray - ray material, but it's a fresh impact bringing up bluish - bluish-type material."
"falcon, houston, if you are having to dig the prds out, skip it for now, please. --."
"aquarius, houston."
"15, we'll sit tight and think about that for a while. thank you."
yes.
"okay, fine. we can handle that."
"of course, when we were working, it felt - we were working in a couple of craters on station 4. right on the - you know - right on the rim of the craters, we suspected it'd be softer, too."
"geno, houston, with a couple of items. i_mp-i_m go ahead, gordo."
"0kay_ let's give you the really important news first. went around the morn here, and over in nassau bay_ ever_ood_'s doing real fine, and it looks like tracy's going to go out and visit one of our bigger amusement centers around the country and going to have a great day. and everybody just looking forward to %he eva and the deorbit and the splash. out in e1 lago - everybody's fine out there, rono and john's out selling christmas trees today and jaime's going to go out shopping with her aunt some'0ime today and - a little christmas shopping - it's getting near that time of year. and one of your friends from phoenix is due in today, for the rest of tee r_ission, i guess. and out in tueson_ rt was a little early this morning, jack, but everybody's up and about and i talked to your mother, and everybody's fine. she's getting anxious to go back to silver city and see all the celebration_ i o_lessthose people out there are really enjoying it sad really getting wild about it. but eve_%ody's fine all the way around, all the way around_"
yes. *** hitting your plss.
okay; thrust away from the moon. that's doing it. a little more.
"okay. let me - first of all, let me see how we're doing here. that 's going down. that 's better. that 's coming up. that 's right. let 's - okay. let's park the radar. how - how long is it going to take? 03 01 11 48 imp not too long. okay, inverter 2 ... here, hold the light for me, jim. right here on the ... panel. hold it still .... ac bus a bus tie."
"that's affirmative. that means no maneuvers between now and midcourse 7- and this is a horizontal in-plane burn, plus x, toward the sun, 19.3 feet per second."
let - let me finish the pan and come and help you.
okay; standing by to copy. go ahead.
"let's read you the lights we got on now; cryo press, fuel cell 1, fuel cell 3, main bus b undervolt, suit compressor."
"okay. and as we're supposed to update your trajectory, which is looking good - predicted perilune at pdi without doi-2 would be ll.9, a little lower. so that means that doi-2 will be a little less, in terms of delta-v, than nominal. but, otherwise, looking good."
"no, no - as long as you've been in there 15 seconds. and we'll just check it here."
yeah.
yes.
"you think it's a function of sun angle, jack, or is it just - just a red like we see out in new mexico area sometimes - some of the areas? l_ yes. no, it's not sun angle, because that'll hold a good red color right - right in towards sunset or sunrise. it's - it's due primarily, i'm sure, like most desert areas, to the oxidation of the iron-bearing minerals in the sands and rocks in those regions."
bastards'
okay.
"how you doing, clip? 04 10 27 08 cml° okay, pete. it's 106:30. i'll be starting to pitch over, so hang on."
do the side right now.
"ten feet, 1/250 - -"
you got two pockets: one on each foot.

there you go.
okay.
that's right.
okay; copy that.
okay. e_$ of tape apollo 16 air-to-ground voice transcription
"dave, we don't show you turned anything on this morning; it's just a long protracted business of turning it off. and i guess, that was - used to be starting after the tv pass. and i guess that- what we're saying right now is it looks like we're going to start turning that off during or before the tv pass."
"okay, and i'm going to - -"
"it's one of the biggest crater - chain crater valleys that i've seen on the moon. it - we saw some crossing mendeieev, in the first few days, i think we zalked about, similar in shape but not nearly as big."

"okay, the roller pawl is on the far left side of the latch, behind and above the auxiliary release button. and it can be identified by the roller on the tip of the pawl. the pawl is just a little arm that sticks out, and it's got a little roller on the end of it that rides on the cam that has these detents in it."
okay. we're noticing _;omewater inside the command module for the first time. there's a little puddle of it on the aft bulkhead sort of like 101 had.
"082, i think, but we want 1.4."
number 2. o1 06 4o 37 imp good.
"go ahead, houston."
every time?
"yes, gordy, i certainly thought i did, but i can't specifically - i know the high bit rate was there, because we switched to low later. i can't - i'm afraid i can't specifically verify the command reset."
"why don't we get this big piece of dike now? imp-eva see if you can get - whoa! don't hit it again. there, you've still got some - still got some contact there. d cdr-eva *** some good contact. man, that'll do it."
"okay, now i need no special techniques to do this."
mark.
that's affirm.
australia in general is still very clear except in the northeastern portions where it looks like they have got scattered clouds; but it looks like a pretty night - over australia.
"houston, 15. go ahead."
up toward that hatch.
"yeah, it's still in sci, waiting for you guys to tell us to finish up our film cycling checklist."
ron?
okay. get the etb and get all our film.
"okay, ron."
"boy, that's dirty."
"okay. o0 04 09 b7 cc 16, your tv down-link looks good out at the site; however, we can't see it here in houston live."
"ok - okay, dave. and continue on, please."
"up tft.k_etry, cm and iu, both to block."
they all look different to me when i go hanging upside down.
"no, i mean, did you? ob 06 34 55 lmp yes."
"..., jack. okay?"
"water connector, locked."
"okay, let me get out of the way."
"roger; we missed, if you did call time base 6 starting. i would like to know how the tank pres- sures looked. over. 00 02 21 b8 cdr okay, it looks to us like time base started within 1 second of nominal time, and the oxidizer tank is currently sitting - - 00 02 21 45 cml° oh, wait a minute."

"okay, a_rica, we've got the dump."
"okay, i'm reading pressure, b85_ flags are clear, and 50 percent."
"okay, i'm on page 9-4, don. ta_e 8/2"
roger. understand. (columbia )
"okay. while i'm trying to get a bite of lunch here, i thought i'd just tell you that after the dump, the same thing happened - the same kind of cloud, the same kind of particles that - that i _f described yesterday. and they've just about - they've just about dispersed now. well, you know, r karl, the interesting thing, i guess i hadn't thought about it before, but when you're sitting up here looking at the surface through one window, it's just pitch black out the other windows. so you go from a very bright scene in one window to a black in the other."
no. i'm going to go deploy an alsep.

"okay, that's a sextant star check at 78:15 with no verb 41, doing it manually and deleting the star check at 78:22."
i went ...
"computeractivity light out, right?"
"well, you want to test it out here, before we go around?"

"and, bob, during this lmp and cdr suit doffing and cweg [?] changeout and so forth, the lmp will be off biomed until he gets a new set and gets cleaned up and gets them on. so i just want you to understand all that."
"bob, i have the first hint of contamination on window 5. it's covering, probably, the central - well, i'd say, - roughly around - it's square about - 7 inches in - on the side with a very thin film that's catching the sunlight; and slightly irridescent, but also very finely granular - very finely granular. you can just barely tell what it is, actually."
i doubt it.
okay. it's in. iiconfid'en day
i wore my hand out holding that camera together coming out here.
everything looks good.
"roger. that means how many picture's been taken in some of the magazines there. i think al's been doing it. he probably knows what's going on, if he can tell you."
... could be ... the rays probably coming out of the king.

"okay, bob, there's a big spall lying on the ground here that has been knocked off up there, from right on top of the boulder. and, i tell you, the more i look at this - the south half of this boulder, the more heterogeneous in texture it looks. it looks as if it may be either a recrystallized breccia of some kind, or you had a gabbroic anorthosite - magma catch up an awful lot of inclusions. i guess i prefer the latter explana- tion because of the extreme vesicularity of the rock."
"okay, wait a minute."
"now, this one's going to come open if we're not careful. let me see if i've got one more step to go up. no i think that's the last one. i'll just hold it here until you get it. i could shove that in if i push it with the src. jack, the cap'll come open. be careful."

"i'm sorry about that, but that thing is just hard to get a hold of and keep a hold of."

"well, that's good."
roger. there - we see it going. --
"is that upper or lower, jack?"
"okay. we copy that. 01 22 2b 01 cmp ... triangle or a little diamond developed down there and then - and it disappeared. 0nly this time_ it kind of joined with a different little cell, but it was the same cell next to it. i still have the big one. it's about an inch long - at 11 o'clock - as i had before. i still have a finger that's developing about 12 o'clock, emd another one about 2 o'clock. and they seem to be migrating again toward the bottom of the dish."

"that's better. let's read you what we - what we have. we have what they had in the flight plan, and if it's been changed from the flight plan, we don't have it."
tell me when to close it. that's it.
"got it. thank you. 07 21 39 25 _ say, fellows .... lose my comb. when i find it, i'll ..."

the regs are egress.
"spacecraft roll alined, al? !"
"aquarius, houston. we're finished with the uplink. the computer ts yours. we'd like to power down the dua, so pull the dua circuit breaker please."
roger. the rates look real good. you can go ahead.
"are you getting any picture, yet?"
"yes, short can in 5."
"no, let's get a couple of them. i've got - i've got one."
... get that up ...
yes.
okay.
"boy, he'd make short work of them."
"that's - that's correct, and main bus - bus a is reading 29 plus volts."
"it's like a billiard ball. that's what people can't understand, how flat and round it -"
yeah; right. i'll come over there.
no. he said -

"no, i didn't, because they're on the floor there. i just never had a chance $o get it up to put in there."
"hey, there's old hadley rille out there. z_lat's a pretty deep little trough. hey, you really didla't get a perspective of that thing, at least i didn't from some of the pictures. not until you had a chance to get up here and. take a look at some of the other things."
"look at this rock right here, john. pure white."

we have lo bit rate.
okay. we'll set the timer again.

put it under the electrical cable.
roger. and stand by 1 second.
"apollo 13, houston."
"eagle, houston. that's fine."
we are.
okay.
"okay, houston, the tds sampling: is complete, and the final counter, closeup, is reaciing 311."
"- - on, 58:36."
okay.
"houston, turn - turn off the front drive power to it. i think you're right because those front wheels were really digging in."
"that might be worth a - how's our time for traverse, bob? do we have time for an lrv sample?"
"thank you very much, houston. apollo 15 air-t0-ground voice transcription 08 08 12 -- begin lunar rev 63"
"well, that's supposed just to break right loose. let's - let's look on the bottom. did you?"
"oh, i can't do that .... in a goddamned hurry."
roger. that's affirm.
"mark it, i minute."
"eagle, houston."
"you know, i was looking at d-caldera and you got a lobate - a lobate flow front sticking down in the crazy thing. i'll be darned."
"aquarius, houston. we're handed over. how do you read?"
"i think you're right, charlie."
oops. got it.
"one jett bag. oops - oh, the big one. you _o% to have a bigger hole than this to get it through. okay. let's wait for gene, then."
yeah.
"just fine, dave."
"stand by, we got it here someplace; 7 hours and - 7 hours 15 minutes and 31 second.s."
"ron, just to update you on several things that happened while you were on the back side this time, the surface crew is at the lm and did their - they're in the close-out procedures there. and they unveiled the plaque and read a message to the school children on the world, and they received a telephone call from dr. fletcher, who said he'd been in close contact with the white house and was following - they - the white house was following the journey very closely and ex- pressed the good wishes of all people down here to all of you up there."
"okay. i see there is this cloud concentration between new guinea and guam. the more i look at it the less well developed it appears to me compared to some of the other circulation patterns. it could be just a residual depression from teresa that has moved out into that area. it is an isolated, a relatively isolated cloud pattern, fairly small, but apparently fairly dense. but has - does not have a strong cyclonic pattern to it. nothing at all like the pattern that now exists above borneo and seems to be moving towards luzon."
"roger, ed."
okay; good show.
"no, it sounds like you all thought it out. i appreciate your letting me know about that. i think - is the time line worked out good enough in there to work in a p41? i guess it does - an hour before, huh?"
"dave, this is houston."
...
that did it. okay. let me sneak it back on again. okay.
"roger, houston. apollo ll, ready to copy mcc 2."
here i come.
"no, i haven't. i was just told, jack, that the - the weathermen and a lot of other people around here, too, are following your weather reports with great interest."
"okay. the 04 under column b is 34761, and the 05 line under column b is 15403. over."
roger. we copy.
"you did, and i put it in."
"okay, dave and jim. that was a good try. let's press on towards station 9. let's take a good clean comfortable look at that rille."
- - finish your cleanup.
"oh, good."
"ail right. take the main regs, two, open."
"let's hear it again, joe."

"and there's 1 minute, and it's sliding out to the left, now. just going along peachy-keeno. tank pressures are beautiful."
"go ahead, houston."
you have auto.
"okay, that sounds good to us."
"uh-oh. oh, man."
and the heads down. that's good.
"ken, we need to get the high gain, and i guess we need you to do a manual roll about 30 degrees left."
"okay. ail right, houston; we've verified the audio - cdr's audio panel."
"- - you'll be in rate commknd, and you will have the bell shaking. it'll start to damp a little bit; but every time you hit with an impulse, why, you'll excite the oscillation again."
"it was the greatest intensity - the intensity on that last one i had - but - the brightness was there, but it was kind of dull glow to it. it wasn't a - a spot that you could really focus on."
okay. and i'll have an etb ready for you.
okay ....
"yes, it's got - mixed with local soil. i'm pretty sure. let's turn it over. i think i'd recognize the top, although it's got dust all over it now."
yeah.
roger. we'll do that.
we're going to give tommy a gold star for that one.
"(singing: happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday, dear bob, happy birthday to you)"
mark. you have mode iv now.
"doing that, al?"
4g's.
my side's full.
"- - i can't remember what the dang rocks looked like, to be honest with you."
roger.
"pete, you ought to move the ... that thing could fall off there and hit your dsky, now. you ought to put it somewhere else."
"okay. got that, gene."
"oh, boy!"
i'm ready to configure you.
go ahead.
okay.
"gene, no time constraint on that aot breaker; except, if it's foggy, it hasn't been in long enough."
"okay, take a drink."
"okay, i need a magazine too, bob. i don't have any film at all."
"okay, very good."
"okay. that's fine with us - with us, charlie. go ahead. 04 09 28 il lmp-lm oh, hello there, tony."
"that's affirmative, pete. all those good things at sharp crater."
"okay. a piece of that spalled rock that was sitti'ng by the gnomon - ooh, watch out gnomon. how about that? - is in -bag 535."
"no, i had the color mag on there, tt. that's the ones that was on there yesterday."
"15, this is houston. go ahead."
"okay, got it. okay, here's a chunk of it. the black rock looks - some of it's glass-coated, tony, and man, that is a shatter cone - -"
yes. that looks to me like it should be getting easy. just hold on to me and - 0h 22 21 51 lmp-eva what was that?
here. let me - dust the dust brush first.
"roger, dave. i believe that."
"16 - houston, 16."
"falcon, houston. give us po0 and data. i have an up-link for you."
"no, but you can put it in mine. can you reach it?"
"boy, that is absolutely beautiful! it has a black fracture pattern running right through the middle of it. it's about - about 6 - it looks like a subdued breccia, and that's the truth. i can't believe it."
"well, unfortunately, bessel is the only one of that magnitude around - around that particular area. and i don't see any other craters that appear to go down below - whose depth appears to go down below the depth of the rim in bessel."
"okay, i'm already going there."
okay. and you've got the uv to get yet?
"joe, that should take care of my plss for tonight."
the earth's coming up in the window again in 1 to 2 minutes.
"okay, the reason for this change is that we have to use the dac, instead of the nikon, since we've run out of nikon film. the first change is under procedure - l, configure camera; we go down to the second line in the cm 4, et cetera, we - we x that out, and we substitute - cm 4 - - 11 05 31 4_ cdr stand by 1, karl. we want to find out if we have any more nikon film. we may have some. _-_ 11 05 31 58 cc okay."
"okay, we'll stand by for the light."
"endeavour, falcon. if you're reading, we're not reading you."
okay. get our average-g ...
"how much did you see, pete?"
"look at there, you can see your flags out, john."
"roger. l_mp but then, you didn't ask."
roger.
ahhh!
"roger. at 180 hours 50 minutes get, we should like to delete your oxygen fuel cell purge."
"cabin pressure, 5.4."
i think we better get this - all the windows down.
"how are the pressures looking over there, jim? 03 06 35 04 i_p beautiful. about 170 on both."
roger. copy. looks great.
okay ....
*** three times.
"you think that's poppy, huh?"
"0ks_, how about any other panels around? it looked like on tv there might be some on that panel just to the right. and, if so, do you have any words on any other panels?"
yes.
"copy that. and frame time, jack?"
we got to take it off.
"... there. we don't have nothing ... ·07 02 41 08 _ yes, we do...."

"okay, we're going to open the pressure equalization valves."
"okay, houston; aquarius."
right. i'm with you_ charlie.
all right. if you're not already done with it.
okay.
"yes, i lost both those guys. they - they decided they wanted to sleep, and i may be rumbling around here for a while but i took - we all three took seconal, so i think we'll get to sleep before long."
"and, amer - houston, america; i missed t2 on."
that's about the station. that's the northernmost station anyway. there's another one there.
what?
"hello, there."
"endeavour, houston. standing by for your burn status."
"okay, plus 52."
"okay, dave. and we got a few updates here for the time after the tv pass, if you're ready to copy. some other stuff that we are moving up because of this."
do you have ...
i would go right around that crater to the left there. isn't that a level spot there? 04 14 59 25 l_ ° i think this right here is just as level.
"okay, jim. there's a good pile of rocks right here."
okay.
"no sweat. oh. oh. 05 06 15 06 i_4p-lm ail right, bow's that?"
"we - once you get it open, you can't get it locked. i'll dust them if i get a chance, but it's locked on the left side."
"yes. okay, yours is on over here."
okay. we'll be watching our antenna. we're still on high gain.
it'll come back ... where are we on the clock?
roger. copy our torquing angles. we're about to torque them.
"getting ready to move out, dave?"
"(music - ""truck driving man"") 03 15 39 00 i2_p wh_t is that?"
"we're having a long conversation about that latch, ron. why don't you all just press on down the checklist and leave it as it is while we think about it?"
"manual takeover, all that baloney, 5 and 5. if pgns is greater than 10 foot per second in any axis - got to do a doi plus 10. forget it. if the ags and pgns differ by - and then we got a few other hot rules here like, less than 2, go out for trim to 5. i gather then that if it - if the burn is anything less than 5, you don't trim."
"okay, 50 18. proceed."
"look i - i can't understand you. oh, you wanted this right here."
"houston, aquarius. how do you read?"
()kay.
"yes, go ahead."
"abort system propellant, rcs command; verify."
"any time you want them, i can start them."
"okay, i guess we can forget the rest of that heat flow. 05 01 22 55 lsd-eva now, if i go do the - ah, rats_"

and we'll have to switch co_i carriers so i can take this suit stuff off.
"okay, and you want bag 2 under the seat?"
roger.
"houston, how do you read? we don't have a very good knock - lockon here in reacq."
"okay, you're - yes, here's what i got. i got - i got delta i and delta 2 on b/d roll. i've got charlie 3 and charlie 4 for pitch, and i've got delta 3 and delta 4 for yaw. okay. that sounds exactly right."
"no, i didn't touch it. i'm over at the central station now."
"don, how about if we go ahead and do our p52s now?"
thank you.
yes.
okay - a little higher than normal.
okay. i disagree on the fifth line. it appears that we ought to have the ascent eca control open.

"okay, fred; houston."
i don't note any abnormalities in the _m. the pods seem to be in good shape. the pr[mary and secondary struts are in good shape. _itennas are all in place. there's no evidence of problem underneath the lm due to engine exhaust or drain- age of any kind.

"watch it; i'll go up and get this one. dark black, very fine grain basalt. by golly!"
"roger, ron. a real good readback. the - on the next page, on page 3-82, the data there is exactly the same as the loi limit cue card - the changes. we can read it up to you individually or you can take it from your cue cards; your choice."
"hey, pete?"
"unfortunately, we only have one window that has a view of the earth and it's filled up with the tv camera, so your view now is probably better than ours is."
we could take these lifevests ...
"go ahead, endeavour."
okay. done.

somebody would chew his ass if it didn't.
"protected, yes."
"oh. 0h 18 53 37 cdr ed, i just wonder how come mccandless has the audacity to presume that we're wrong about doublet crater (laughter)."
stand by 1.
ro_er. we're seeing it all on tv here.
2 minutes and 33 seconds.
"roger, eagle. correction - roger, columbia. we copy. you guys are speedy; you beat us ko the punch. we had a couple of things for you."
"while jack is getting the sleep station rolled up, i thought i would show you one interesting corner. we've got a temporary stowage bag here and that's where all our wastepaper and all that goes while we're - after every meal. it's in the right-hand corner down by our dump system."
...
"okay, we've got a large boulder of very intensely fractured rock, right on the rim, right near the rover. it looks like - it looks like a finely vesicular version of our clinopyroxene gabbro. it's obviously crystalline and has generally that same appearance. there is, in one spot here, some inclusions of a darker gray rock also intensely fractured. the fracture systems, i think, will show up well in the flight line stereo."
let a1 get -
"okay. now, i think i - be careful because you might hook it on something down there."
"okay, we copy that. 372."
"okay, fredo. i'm right in the midst of a whole pile of very large boulders here. it's - see what i can do to grab a meaningful sample."
"yeah. okay, the collar is locked on the central station. i'm gonna get the subpallet here."
"apollo 11, this is houston. over."

"that must - hey, look! there's van serg, blocky rim crater. that's the other side of cochise there. see it?"
"hey, how soon do you fire up the batteries in that bastard; right away though, don't you?"

i'll get it. let me get it.
okay.
"yeah, you - it - it's like - three guys - they've each got a window, and we're staring at - at the ground. it's really - boy, this has got to be the neatest way to make a living anybody's ever invented."
"houston, apollo 15."
"that's affirm. i've got some reports for you, if you're ready to copy."

"burn time - 5:55. and, when you get the shutdown, you got a 2-second thruster vi. right?"
wait a minute; go back to b.
"hey, dick, it never fails to do that. i'll be goddamned if i know. we're talking to you fine up until 1 minute, and then you can't hear me. now, it could be that, when i'm burning, my thrusters are doing something that's blocking that vhf."
"how do you read, bob?"
"okay, karl, go ahead. it's on."
i got it! i got it!
one antenna up.
"okay, vance. i'm on - do you read me now, hot mike?"
"i think so. i think maybe john and i'd have been able to pull it out, but it would have been a battle."
"okay, and also isidorus, the same vhing."
"plss, 94.5. _ff.-'-,."
"as - as far as dave's bag, joe, - i forget the number on it, but i'll just take out the - the core tubes that we have not used, and then it will be ready to go in $rc 2. is that correct?"
"yes, i'm not rushing."
that could be tomorrow. we need five?
roger.
hide every goddamn thing around here.
that was close.
"beautiful. 04 14 24 30 l_l° well, i had that one inside my mouth that time."
"okay, ron. you can uv cover, open, anytime."
no. if they had a bypass valve or something on the - 08 01 07 o1 cml° what?
i'm starting to rake.
"and, it's spring loaded to neutral. it moves - i think - - maybe that's just jim wiggling the rear end."
...
you're right again. here we are and i'll be able to grab it with my hand. put this away.
"we've just got through with the playback, and we've got excellent burn data down here. and, if you'll give us accept, we'll send up a refsmmat."
"that's right. 0! 10 03 17 lmp gordy, how do you read?"
go ahead.
...
"okay. the recommendation, ed, is to pull it up and mo,re - over a bit and try it again."

"you know, the crater dawes has got - starting from the top going down the rim, there's a kind of a light-tan layer, it's a concentric layer that goes all the way around; and then you come into a lighter - it's almnst to the white and it looks like on the hills and all around the landing site. and this first layer goes down maybe - let's see, as you look at the total distance in there, about a third of the distance; and then the white layer - concentric layer that goes all the way around, and this is in the western wall i'm looking at now, and it goes down to - to about a half of the distance, not quite half of the distance from the top of the rim down to the bottom. and then the lower port_oa of it, the lower half, a little better than a half really, is kind of a tannish gray - has a tannish- gray albedo to it. it's all streaked. and close to the bottom of the layer, the bottom of the crater itself is - filled with - well, oddly enough, it's the same color of material that's - that's laying around the edges of the crater, it has some radial rings around it, which gives an indication of a subsidence of some kind, or a sliding down the hill. _at's really the first crater where i've been able to see any sort of layering in the walls. now the first layer on the north side and also on the south side, in the dark brownish layer of the thing, you can see parts that are jagged, jagged, and sticking out. in other words, there's a slight change in slope in it. that looks like it's a very steep slope, which would indicate that it's a fairly con - compacted type of material in the first layer. and then the slope changes in the white layer on down a little bit more. and the white layer seems to sort of combine and maintain the same type of slope as the dark-gray stand - layer - the bottom, or from halfway down to the bottom of the crater."

"okay. thank you. and if you can think of it, when the time comes up, when you're not venting_ how about remembering to take a look through them and give us a word?"
"orion, this is houston. is the csm above you or below you? we hope he's directly ahead. 04 04 3_ l_ cc roger."
"roger. l_ looks like about a north-south lineation with a very strong crinkling, roughly east-west."
"just another piece of data, guys. on this maneuver you're in right now, it should go out to a 67-degree middle gimbal angle right in this msjleuver."
not too good.
"outstanding. -- separate, simultaneous co_4unications link in use between cc and cm"
"roger. we copied; and, charlie, we want to start on l_ge 2-1 in the activation checklist."
"houston, rock box 2's going onto the y-pad with the mylar or whatever you - film or whatever you call that stuff off the s-band antenna, going on t°_f_it."
yes (chuckle) and we know that too.

okay.
yes. i suspect jt very well might.
and it's all yours.
are you in high bit rate?
"we got it, dick. go ahead. 05 22 21 45 c_ roger. i've got some good torquing angles here. i guess you really don't need them, do you?"

we don't want you to wake anyone up to get it.
probably a good idea you couldn't see how steep it was going up.
that's affirm - -

"roger, id. and we copy the glass."
moving out?
thanks.
how about that - how about that - whew - how about - that piece?
"tony, how are we doing on time?"
okay. get off.
"looking into the sun, you can't tell any difference anyway. however, i tell you, i certainly get the impression there is a mantle. i would say that -"

just about.
"guys, we just had indication that your thrust light came on again for about l0 seconds. did you notice that?"
"karl, if you've got a paper and pencil there while i'm - while i'm finishing up breakfast here, let me run down some cameras - magazines with you. i just - took inventory of all the mags last night. and, thought i might just read through the list for you, and-"

"the major boulders still look like the - the pyroxene gabbro. surface texture has not changed. there is a - there is a granule population, now that i look at it more closely, with the shadows. but i have a feeling that most of those are - they look like they're just small, very small clods. that should show up in some of the bulk samples we've taken. it is remarkable to me the - only a small number of fine-grain rocks. there's one at about halfway between the sep and the lm that i'd like to pick up, it's a fairly good sized one. maybe we can get it when we get back. it looks like a fine-grained basalt. i may have sampled one in 45 yankee there."
"and relay, off."
where?
yes.
"okay, let's see. are we ready for lunar sounder? need a clock down here by panel 230 (laugh). not really. i can look back and see the leb one. okay, it's about time. okay. lunar sounder's verified in standby. the recorder is going on. radar is going on. and the recorder is off, not the heaters. if antenna l, verify they're out, eh? extend. no barber pole. back to off. number 2 extend. no barber pole. back to off. okay, mode is going to hf and let me take a look at - alfa is off; bravo is off. b data is off, beacon is off; ranging is off. okay, let's see. two, two. 250 lens. okay."

"sounds good, charlie."

"oh, boy! god, i guess. that thingwas huge."

"well, i think the first ridge over there, about another 75 yards, might be our answer. right beyond this next - these next two craters. 04 19 51 47 cd_ yes, i think so. it's probably a pretty good spot. about right up there. 04 19 51 52 _4_ yes."
no.
"hello, casper; houston. standing by."
get old muley out of there?
okay. i'm just starting p20.

roger.
now look at that - my imagination. i don't think so.
"that's charlie, that's what i got."
yes. but how about the rocks under the seat?
"okay. do you have - maybe a1 could try pressing _ down on the three ekg leads, cue at a time, for us; that may help us out."
okay. ready? here we go. okay.
roger; stand by.
okay. the lens is tucked in - -
"okay, fine."
that 's right.
"roger. you mean the main mission timer over on panel 2, then. _-_"
"okay. and when you get to power 6, you ought to see a circuit breaker page, panel 11."

i know it.

"okay, 346; 1.1. i think it would almost be worth - i bet that's emory up on that hill. it's got to be."
look at the ice go up there.
"okay. under the scs powerup, the first line says ""auto rcs select, 16, to off."" okay. you can just delete that part. on the fifth line, it says ""circuit breaker scs logic power,"" that's really ""logic bus, four of them, to closed."" the delta-v cg is not important since we are not burning the engine. the ""signal conditioner/ driver bias power"" lists ""two to ac 1."" we are going to make that just one of them; make it ""signal condition/driver bias power, one, to ac 1."" the ""bmag power,"" which is the third line from the bottom, says ""bmag power, two, on;"" we are going to make that just one. we'll bring up number 1, and we'll make ""fdai power, num- ber 1"" and the last line ""auto rcs select, 16, enable,"" you can strike that off and reslace it with ""bmag mode, three of them, to rate 1."" you want to try reading that back?"
"that's correct, i've had no messages from falcon. 01 10 27 49 cml° okay, he has been calling you, karl. 01 10 28 18 cml° houston, 15."
roger.
"any dark deposits associated with the gamma? reiner gamma? yes, it's - the gamma, itself, is - is dark. now, when zero - zero - hey, i think we're going to be lucky - zero phase is going to go right through it. but there are dark - in other words, the gamma, itself - is about the same size as the - as the - the full extension is about the same size as the crater reiner. and then half of a crater diameter on the inside of that - and, of course, in the gamma-type shape is a dark type material. zero- phase is going right through it right now. by gosh, it didn't blot out the dark at all."
... okay.
"oh, shoot! *** any bags so - -"
okay ....
"*** charlie, wait a minute. wait a minute; here - let me put this in your bag and give you a hand *** turn that. got to get a rock off the top before we turn it, right?"
... stuff down here.
"america, advise we're reading all of you on ron's vox."
it doesn't matter right now? okay.
everything looks good.
relief is auto. 3-6 _ day 5
"roger. they're in the flight plan at 84:32 and 84:39. mapping camera: t-start, 84:42:23; t-stop, 84:54:14. the pan camera times are the same as the mapping cameras times, and we would like to change a shutter speed at 84:24. instead of 125th, we want 1/250th at 84:24."
that 's right. yes.
"roger. - 05 02 10 21 lmp-eva we got a good slope here about, - i'd say i0 degrees; we're going up right now."
"yes, well - we'll make it. i haven't looked at it myself, but we are - fao has - and i haven't heard exactly what needs to be changed, if anything. okay, on the sim bay. basically there's nothing new to report. and all the people down here ap- preciate your timely operation of the sim bay, and it's responsible for really maximizing the data return. in general, we're pretty happy. the problems that we're have - having with it are ones that have already been mentioned to you. on the - on the hf antenna retract problem that we have, if we have it, here's the plan. we're - well, first of all, the consensus on that is that we really think the antennas are retracting okay. that it's a malfunction in the limit switch that drives the talkback that's really the problem. so we have devised an alternate method, utilizing timing and stall current, and actually the signa- ture of the motor stall current down here in the data, to determine proper retraction. and just prior to 168 hours in the flight plan, you're supposed to retract those antennas, and we're going to check the data at that time, and say ""yes"" or ""no""; they are retracting or they aren't. if they don't, then the alternate plan we'll swing into at that time is to reschedule the hf targets that are now scheduled on rev 55- reschedule them and do them on rev 42. after which, we'll try one more time to retract the antennas, and if it still looks like they indeed are not retracting - i guess it's just the one that's in question - then we'll go ahead and jettison them at that time. and we'll still have gotten most of the - of the least - priority hf targets with that alternate plan. over."

okay. we're on the schedule here.
okay; outrigger cable. i24p-eva you ready?
and i'm standing by for the lec.
"mark my words. okay. the light mantle is just what gene has said, it's a - that's it, right now - there are some very bright craters in it - they stand out, bright-haloed craters scattered over it, that - seem to be quite a bit brighter than any- thing we have out here on the dark mantle. see those blocks over there? that's the first dif- ferent colored blocks i've seen; they're sort of gray looking."
"okay. let's start again. ems mode, styj_dby; ems function, off."
"they're interested in that, if i can get it. see up the hill here. oh, look! there's where it hit. see?"
"understand, gene. ail of them are locked."
you can probably write it on a piece of scratch paper. this is pretty easy.
okay. the probe is out.
what's all that about?
roger. i understand.
what? what?
see you vomorrow.
"280, 120, and 040."

"ye_th, we're out of sync, but you're supposed to be going back up there."
"okay. i'll have a few - about three flight plan updates for you, and when we get through, when you get a chance. but here's the way it - the plan is looking. we'll have no pc-2 or shaping burn. we'll do pc-1 about three revs prior to lm lift-off, which according to - which will be about 4 hours later than the flight plan shows. we're showing lift-off of the lm for about 175:44. and in the place of the nominal pc-1 time, we'll be doing the bistatic radar. the - they will have the third eva. it'll be - they're shooting for about 5 hours on it. and, of course, the prime objective is - is north ray. eva-3 and the rendez- vous will be done on the same day, and to hold down the crew time, it'll - that 'll make it about an 18-hour day. we'll hold onto the lm through the rest period and jettison the lm the next day. from your standpoint, everything will be fairly nominal, up until about lift-off minus 6 hours. it'll be pretty close to about what we're showing in the flight plan now. of course, we'll have some updates as they - they work the - the scien- tific standpoint of it. oh, and tei will be ap- proximately a day early."
i can see that. this dot doesn't - doesn't seem hard to see.
"ail righty. 06 05 42 41 cmf but i can see plenty of stars all over the place outside, and i just can't see a thing through that telescope. and i know we could when we were in earth orbit, because the first thing i thought was that we didn't have it, and then i waited until we got around and looked at a bright part of the sky, and we got hold of scorpion. it was there and it was all beautiful. and now, i look out there and it's just - there's just nothing there. it's just black. and that's after getting well dark adapted."
okay. got a go for the depress. cb(16) ecs: cabin repress to open.

"okay. take some _ray tape over to the receiver, gene. and with reference to the fact that the - there is some velcro missing on the front there which hold the covers down, we'd like to tape the two covers together - on the - in the middle there - you know, where the two - two sides over- lap in the middle of the box. tape those two together. a short a_ece a.hout an inch long should do it if they are clean."
"and, houston; falcon. do you have an update for us for the lm weight/csm weight?"
