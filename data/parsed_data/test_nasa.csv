roger. mag l is reading 33. mag k is reading 66. and mag metro is reading 20.
... beautiful.
"that's a smart idea, pete conrad. get them out; have them ready ... you read them; i'll give them to him."
what are you supposed to do? you're supposed to put it on - -
"yes, i've got it. i need to get rid of this - -"
roger. standby.
- - got a little time for the pga ver - -
"roger. 08 21 43 51 lm2d houston, america."
okay_ 30 seconds.
"yes. the readability of that thing is like, you know, half a frame one way or the other; so, 28, i think, is a good number."
"nothing. 04 10 45 37 i2_p-i_ okay. okay, are you sitting up there now? 04 10 45 46 cdr-i_ yes, just stand by. 04 10 46 35 cdr-i_ okay. okay, overhead hatch is open and latched."
"okay. let's go to page 1-11. 0ilpanel 276, no change; on panel 278, we want all circuit breakers open; no exceptions. over."
off to the right.
yes.
they're a hell of a long ways away.
"yeah. that's the hard part about it, isn't it? you know, john, that black stuff is glass - on those rocks."
"... move over. man, it's rough to find a level soot to put anything. okay. number 2 is comin_ gut."
"america, houston. we've got a couple of - couple of items of general information, as you come up on a0s here - los. the - we want to remind you to close the ir - - cml:' okay."
yeah.
okay. i'll get out the cask removal tool.
i just started.
"no - well, go ahead and take them, we got a minute - -"
"roger. it's a spectacular view as we glide across the sea of serenity, and i'm taking a picture now of a sinuous rille out to the north."
...
roger. 04 l0 53 43 cdr-seva i'll get on with the photography here.
look what 's underneath it.
"ail righty. it's reading straight, now."
"oh, okay."
it's the white and black - it's -
"roger. we ham a little trouble with the network there. it appears that the mass spec boom is ja_rml,ed, and we'd like for you to give it a 15-second deploy and then back to retract. 08 01 43 38 c_p okay. 15-second deploy and back to r_rp_.ct. stand by."
"okay, this is the last adjustment. going to f/44. and going - -"
okay.
"okay, pete, my boy. i gave you five of my best ones."
... 3.
"okay. fine, bob."
okay.
"that's affirmative, 16. 09 04 55 27 imp okay, going closed -"
what?
yes. yes. you'll be able to fly right-side up. 03 12 49 .12 _ ...
falcon. roger.
"this is houston. roger, neil."
"that's affirm; at the proper time, and with minimum power."
"okay, copy that, jim."
it's off.
"okay, fred. that's correct, except the aline procedure that wetre working on is an earth/sun aline, and other than that, that's correct. incidentally, this tc plus 2 maneuver looks like it will still be around a 900-foot-per-second maneuver and that it will get you back to the mid-pacific line at 142 hours. 02 22 57 15 _mp okay. that was an earth/sun check, john. we're getting a little close to the moon now. and the tc plus 2 maneuver still looks about 900 foot per second to get us at mid-pac, at about 142 hours."
that one right there?
i bet you can guess.
how could it get out and the stems not get out?
"okay; next page is another ptc spinup, same change, ""delta l, 2, 3, and 4 and charlie 3 and 4"" instead of the listed jets."
"jim, are you climbing off the rover now?"
mark.
"hey - i haven't really talked to anyone in the other two families today. so i'm sure that every- thing is fine or we would have heard it, but i'll try to get a last-minute update on that before you hit the sack."
"roger, jack."
"yes, i hear them, right now."
yes. jim?
"aquarius, aft omni, please."
roger.
"okay - - · 04 10 33 27 cc clipper, houston. we have your data."
and the temperature is - the other transducer is about - 68.
okay.
okay. did you get the 85 display? i guess it's - -
"okay, go ahead."
roger. there is some speculation that you all are responsible for that 1-1/2-point rise right after opening.
gordy. this is the lmp. how do you read?
... bag ...
"okay. i'm strapped in. you're strapped in. soon as i can get the switches on here. okay, joe, now you're going to have to say again where you want us to go, because - -"
"yes. i know - especially when you know it's going to happen. ok 21 54 12 lmp look, why can't i set it like this? you just let go of the side and come over and step on that thing."
"_aarlie, there's your polarimetry thing."
"okay, we hope it was worth the effort. i24p-eva oh, it's all worth the effort; it just hurts."
okay.
"roger. understand, houston. we go on to 1-18. thank you, sir."
that's good.
"roger. three lines down, delete ""pugs, balanced."""
yeah. i'll catch it afterwards.
"yes. there's some interesting patterns on the surface. lnp-eva standby. wait, wait, wait. i keep - aw! sorry, geno, but -"
"... crater chain hadn't ever seen it. it ices make a difference, doesn't it?"
"and when that's done, gene, we're ready for you and your dustbrush to hasten back to the lm and dust each other and climb in."
3020. thank you.
"scientific power is on. ac power on 201, you can tc_n it on."
"okay, let me turn over and see what that says. it doesn't have any dust on the top of it. i thought we could get the fillet sample here, but it doesn't have any dust on the top."
was your morale low before tei?
"okay, you've got 4 milliradians to the north. you're at 1500 feet now."
"ll, houston. we'd like to try the same procedure once more. we'll leave the carrier a little longer and be back up for a call within 4 minutes. over. 03 13 16 35 i_p okay."
"and i think you've got some interesting data on thruster firing versus pitch angle. it looks (goss net 1) tape 51/9 like that lm just wants to head down towards the surface, is all."
on as required to pressurize.
"hey, columbia. houston. mighty fine; loud and clear."
"okay, go ahead, stu."
"i'm - personally, i'm happy to see it, but that's good."
"... all of the bubbles have disappeared, except two."
"endeavour, houston. one minute to los. 107 02 17 41 cmp roger, houston; endeavour. and did you get the gyro torquing angles, ed?"
"well, thank you very much, sir."
"we got 13 degrees left on the ball, and i think (tranq) that's probably about right. looking at the shadow and so on, we prob - probably about 13 de- grees left of the shadow."
... wild out here ...
roger. we copy.
okay. not - no rush.
"okay, joe. f 06 23 44 26 ip£p-eva it's sure hard to see the earth."
"yeah, ... the rcs command is off, too."
"okay, america. once again, you're go to jett the door, and you can do it early, if you wish."
okay. everything else look good to you?
"jim, be advised we had a couple of rcs reg a lights on the back side, and by blipping the system, it - went out. 04 02 17 27 cm2p that's affirmative. 04 02 17 30 lx{p i think he's probably just about out of mode - mode 1 limits, john."
"no, we're not supposed to bring it back ...."
okay. and a rake might be useful -
"okay, houston; 13. are you copying the torquing angles on the p527"
"don't forget, we got ..."
got them. stand by.
"ttca, min."
roger. *#* three asterisks denote clipping of words and phrases. (goss net 1) tape 71/19
"okay. i can verify that we are in that config- uration with the exception of panel 382, the water accumulator, which i've left off in case we wanted to get some more drinking water out of the command module, and i'll put those in the proper configuration before we do anything."
"yeah, you know they have no idea where we are."
huh?
"seen with the naked eye from 60 miles, they've got to be big ...."
"what's that, chsrlie?"
it ought to be in the pan.
"i'm afraid that - that on the specific kind of questions you asked, in this case, i'm - i'm really kind of out to lunch. i - i can't make specific things when you sayhow large. there - the length of these things that i can trace are the same size as - as the crater that i was _-_ looking at. and i guess that must not be that central one, but one of the adjacent ones - one of the ones on the north. but they're - they're quite long, and they're all over the area. they're in craters; they're outside of them; they're on the floors. you see these things just about everywhere you look back there. they're large, and they're just - it sort of defies my imagination. i see nothing that looks like sources anywhere."
"okay, buddy, and there you go."
houston copies.
huh?
"ed, whre's a pair of scissors? never mind. time skip 07 18 46 28 i24p houston."
"roger, dave. copy that. why don't we save the double aekerman for the rougher terrain later on."
"joe, today's the day for a iitt'le pool. 06 19 il 27 cc i was thinking the same thing."
"columbia. roger. (co_,o_mla) oh i',18 3'{ cc and, do you plan on commencing your sleep on the backside this pass? if so, we'll disable uplink bo you while we're talking to the lam. over. 0}l 15 18 51 cmp negative that. (columbia) (f;o:;znet 1) tape 72/2"
you better watch out; it's heading that way.
"just ex - extend the tube several sections. make sure they're in the red, indicating it's locked."
i think tridentts right here.
159. 03 10 29 05 ipr° ... junk.
that's the cmc mode switch. i guess we need to get into auto before we can execute this maneuver.
"okay, ken. you can go to center, off position on the v over h override, and you can go auto on the high gain."
"okay. those batteries kinda put in a day's work, too, today."
"okay, i was off comm over there. how about bringing the old lmp up to speed?"
"okay, ron."
"doesn't say that. okay, while we're waiting, let's check this state vector."
roger.
say again.
"okay, thank you. we'll see you on the other side. f 03 06 20 56 cc roger. apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription 03 06 32 -- begin lunar rev 1"
"well, here; i'll hold this. i can read it to you."
"okay, you got it coming great. okay. you're going to have to come right a little bit - lef_ a little bit. clear your '_lss."
"and, john, i guess using that heater's about the only thing we know to do. if that doesn't work, we don't have an answer for you."
okay.
"man, that time is gonna be 06:14."
okay.
"roger. we see that on the prog here, jack."
yes.
the probe?
roger.
"yeah_ that's what i mean, 2 back."
"and if you'd like a visual check of just exactly where that's hanging up, why we can give it to you in a couple of hours. we'll have a1 go out and take a look."
"h20 connector, locked."
is this a rover sample or - -
go ahead. tape108/5
- - apollo 15 has good mains.
"17, how do you read?"
"okay, gene. you've got min deadband, att hold, now."
okay. okay. head for the site.
"roger, jack. good readback except burn time is 4:50 and not 4:54. and we'll be losing you here in about a minute, so wait on the rest of that pad. just a reminder for ron, we'll be standing by at ascension for the next gyro torquing and - wa might have a drift update on the - imu there. i_2° okay, he copied that. and we'll wait for the rest of the pad."
"don't get it out to look, but i just wondered if you remembered."
don't let us get iow. that worries me more than anything. i think we'll see the crater; i just hope we - hope we - -
"let me get turned around here a little bit. okay, _-_ now i'm a little bit more out of the way for you. 04 23 38 13 iafp-lm okay. i'm ready to go down."
201 in the sun. 05 11 41 11 imp okay.
"it ps on, right on the money."
we copy it.
"- - 3 - 5 seconds, i thrust for 3."
"okay, ed. and i'll ... in a minute."
"you've got about 17 minutes before you'll have to drive off, so we'll have to hustle with this."
- - the last 3000 is the hardest. they don't say it. i just made it up.
roger. i wish i could do the game here. o0 05 20 40 cm? no. don't leave thc console!
"13, houston. we'd like you to isolate your 02 surge tank. over."
"well, it wasn't too bad."
"no, you're doing fine. you got up to about 120 is all."
yes. all right.
thank you.
"okay. well, that disappeared. get it this way."
we went over the procedures on how to dock the thing in ... - -
okay. i don't have it yet. 06 21 _5 08 cc okay. 06 21 45 10 l_lp-eva that's a21 a - okay.
"wait, ron, we're going to have an antenna switch coming up. we'll call you back when we get good eolqm. 10 09 47 51 cmip okay."
i can look at it tomorrow. we can find out when passing by the y strut tomorrow.
"we can't get down it it, but take a picture."
"and, joe, you can remember on this particular sample that i - i moved the gnomon about 2 feet, so jim could get a 1, 2, 3, 4, - i guess we got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 swaths there."
"roger, ed."
roger.
"roger. we have the sm/ac power off, down on 180 [sic], per the p40 checklist. should we put that power on?"
"roger, dave. that's the only goody we came upon -"
okay. ei minus 2-1/2.
the little ones?
"()kay. well, all it - it only needs to be moved about 3 or 4 inches."
"okay. 320, 010, 324. high gain: pitch, min_ 29; yaw, 17. and that's at - that's for the verb 49 maneuver at 84:35."
... but it's just - ... tighten up our ...
let me change - -
"get the wire out in front of the camera. l0 03 13 33 imp it's the wire, yeah."
"0h, the geocorona, hopefully."
"okay. it's a - we've got one full core, second core is going in about 2 inches per h_mmer stroke."
"okay. with the sextant photo test here, we have a call for a pcm cable, and the only ones we have on board will not reach the connectors over by the right-hand girth shelf. do you have any suggestions on how we can get the dac connected to the pcm?"
"okay. no, we're definitely not in favor of that, gene, at this area."
"i'm not saying that at all, john."
hey -
- - at a slower pace. just like you're going now. i think this is halo crater right up here in front of us.
"roger, karl."
"did you ever tap the talwbacks to see if you could make it flip over? 06 09 27 27 c_ i noticed a couple of times, when i went to retract, the barber pole would go - it would go full barber pole and then very slowly slip down to about half barber pole and stay there. 0,609 27 39 cc okay. but did you tap the talkback at any time? tap?"
okay; thank you.
mmmm.
stand by.
"columbia, houston in the blind. request high gain. pitch minus 30, yaw plus 170. over."
"sorry, john. didn't see i_."
"i don't think so, karl, other than the fact that it looks very clear. there arenlt - it's not smudged or anything right now."
"we're down in the time line. getting slightly green, jimmy, my boy? 08 04 o1 34 _ no."
"okay, let's come down with the left tape."
"master arm, off."
"no, let's get your last circuit breakers now."
real great. did a fine job.
"oh, oh, it says - well, youget the idea that the - let's see - it says secure t_e high gain antenna."
"(laughter) 06 22 15 40 i_4p-eva oh, and - -"
"okay, then you want to go back and go through step 12."
okay; 216 - use - -
"no, not quite - not now. that comes later. okay, kick your feet out. okay, your plss is over on - partially over under the perch. come this way a little bit. okay. you've got your plss hung up. your right corner is on the door over there. throw your rear end - there you go. you got it."
yeah. this almost flat?
"houston, aquarius. jack's entering the command module, now. para,7]0 05 .i.(, il) 48 (x', ok,'_y, ,lira. 05 16 1[ ]}i lm_'_ okay. that ]._.tjoe was execute at tileget at 138:10:00 which is eir,linus 4-1/2 hours; execute a push of 0.5 feet per second, four-jet ullage; then execute sm sep fo:l_lowedby a pull of 0.5 feet per second, with respect to a nomenclatlzre on the ttca; i think we really need an up of 0.5 and then a down of 0.5."
and mou_t the dac on the sextant.
you're at the bottom step. 04 18 38 44 _p i'm on it?
okay; got it.
"houston, boy, it sure looks like you could make - i see crown crater from here; i can see ray crater frorahere. not a - boy! 04 08 31 49 l_p-lm i almost had apoplexy, that prograi_ alazm__ aml that's you__ radar breaker."
i - we obviously did - -
go ahead.
roger. i concur with that. (tranq)
it's coming across.
okay.
h2 tank 3 fans to off; h2 tank 2 fans to on.
okay. '
that's it.
roger. okay; uv cover coming open - 03 15 57 lh lmp mark it.
"right. i know what you mean. 04 09 h3 26 _p-lm okay, tony. my passive - my personal dosimeter reads 21109. 04 09 h3 35 cc okay; 21109."
"okay. in that case, we'd like you to repeat the 20-second deploy, 40-second retract sequence twice more and, if gray talkback is still not obtained, we'll turn it off and wait until 275 hours, at which point we'll give you a call and we'll replay - we'll repeat that. over."
(music: thus spake zarathrustra by r. strauss)
he went to captain's mast for eating that the other day.
it is now.
"well, it looks like that's the way we're going. you'll just have to stay in that line of sight, bruce."
"i'm going to take care of that other little item here, which is now due. 06 2b 15 30 lmp-eva yes. maybe you ought to lift up the front end of the rover, so you're clearly visible."
okay. that's done.
mark it.
"okay. the lmp has got his suit on. they're connecting up the lcg water connection, and he's still unzipped."
"and the rocks - you know, the rocks that we're picking up at 5 and 6 - that was a long time before station ll and - _- tape 155/3"
"gordy, it's open."
... it somewhere.
"cold. ob 17 29 19 cdr liquid cooling garment, cold."
"that's moon dust. you talk about a - you talk about two dirty human beings. it took 10 minutes before we could get ken to open the door. as soon as he saw us, he wanted to close it."
"okay, you peaked at lb5, and we had you at 1bo for several minutes. i_p okay."
"houston, this is antares; reading you loud and clear. how me?"
okay. and we think you're even farther north than i was saying. maybe it's about 215 would be your heading for there.
542 is another bag of goodies.
sure do.
"understand. pgns for the direct rendezvous. 07 07 16 34 lnl_-lm okay, houston. can i take bats 2 and 4 off now?"
omni delta.
okay.
"negative, 11. low is okay for now. over. 03 03 31 57 _ roger."
"and, houston, 15. did you copy the p527"
*** a couple fragments in spots.
"okay, it's off."
"roger° that up-link is complete. in case you didn't hear me some time ago, the computer is yours."
"between - between these two steps, right?"
go.
roger; i'm working on the presleep checklist now.
"the spacecraft's been beautiful, 11. we've really no complaints at all. looks - things are really great."
roger. and then i'll get back with you on the delta-p.
"hey, houston. how do you read me? over."
- - we have it here. it's now 10.7 and we have a medical go to ]5 millimeters.
"do you think - i think we can do a little contour travel here, jim. and on the way back pick up that big block up there."
"well, i could put them in one of these bags right here. i24p yes, well - but i'll find a place to put them, too."
"okay, geno and - let's - -"
we're what? 26 - 27-1/2 now.
"- - plus 60442; 225 plus 29365; 226, plus 60449; 305, minus 01659; 662, minus 55021; 673, minus 32306."
coming up.
"houston, 16. do you read?"
okay; we copy.
... kind of surprised me there.
"- - and that particular material - that par - let me finish, bob! that particular rim material there continues around to the due north, and then there's a drastic change again where you see the - the inner rim completely terraced with this boulder fill."
"i just saw a flash, jack."
"well, looks like you really - -"
"i'm afraid some of the fragments will damage the suit. it's not damaging itself. you know, it's - it's just breaking the - hey, i'm better left- handed than right. there goes another fragment. do you see it, pete?"
"hey, here's one that doesn't have a lock locked."
"okay, that sounds good. and_ john, since we're running behind here, i wonder if could operate the penetrometer."
071.
that's better than the hope diamond.
"houston, this is apollo 16. how do you read on vox? over."
okeydokey.
"joe, i have a partial pan there, and my camera stopped working."
"bob, i think, based on what i saw yesterday, that the chances are pretty good that all the big blocks out here in the dark mantle area will be pretty much the gabbros. by the way, i looked at that with a hand lens last ni_ht_ and i don't know that you got the report, and i'm back to saying that it's probably closer to 30 - _0 percent plagio- clase. it's very - it's a good gabbro, a final pyroxene gabbro, and it apparently has a fair amount of ilmenite in it. there's some bright shiny flakes within the rugs and some dark minerals in the matrix that are probably ilmenite. and one other additional possibility then, is that the mantling we're seeing here_ is the - is just dark fine glass - darker than usual, because of the iron and the titaniu_m in the rock itself. also, the probability, i think_ still has to be considered that you're dealing with a true mantle that has been gardened enough that at least where we're seeing it now, in the first few tenths of a centi- meter that it is unrecognizable as a mantling unit yet. the relationship to the large boulders is, i think, one right now, of just filleting and a small amount of covering because of the local gardening process. we haven't seen any clearly mantling relationships between the dark mantl_ or the surface materials here and the large boulders."
"bearing - yes, bearing is right on. right on the money."
okay. we've got no complaint with that.
okay.
"wait a minute. wait, wait. i'm going to ... it."
"nope. 07 08 41 36 i_mp okay, ken, our residuals are minus 0, plus 0, minus 0.1."
boy this one is really getting stiff.
okay.
"okay. it's in full zoom, now."
"yes. eighty-five pictures, mag m, frame number 30 which would be frame number 43."
"okay, on page 3-9, step 4, add ""verify"" after ""master arm, off."" then delete ""audio, co_ander""; and step 6, add ""verify"" after ""mode control, both, off."" then step 7, delete first two lines. and then on - k_y don't you repeat up to that point? over. 07 09 54 24 l_,_ i 6oj i_ ali, jim. svep _: ""verify m__ster alum,cff'_ delete ""au]310, co_{'._2_der;mode control, both, off, verify."" ""window shades and cormaander transfer,"" delete. we'll just leave him over here, huh?"
there was a very large crater over on our - i to 2 o'clock position.
okay. is this 02 or h27
"oh, i thought we were done with it."
outstanding.
"yep, we'd like an lpm. incidentally, your magnetic field there is about 130 gammas back at the lsm."
okay.
roger. that's what i'm gonna try.
"17, houston. the yaw maneuver will be starting in about 4 plus 52, a little less than 2 minutes from now."
"trans control power, off."
that's right. that's - -
"okay. roger, columbia. ti 104 32 24, 104 37 33, 2 miles south. time of closest approach is 104 39 08."
horizontal.
okay. okay.
i got both valometer - intervalometers stuck to the wall over here. they're not hooked to any- thing.
stand by. we'll let you know.
okay. that's -
okay.
"you're on the 30-second mark, and i'm on the minute mark."
"yeah. just about ran out of oxygen, too, while you were at it, didn't you? hey, houston, can you give us a mark at the end of 4 minutes?"
"houston, america. how do you read me? 07 18 00 54 l'_-lm go _head_ houston. this is challenger."
"are you ready for the uv, jim?"
"roger, 11. we copy for the radiations. ar,d, we're considering - this ptc looks sort of weird to us, so we're considerin_ stopp_n_ and startin_ over again_ and we'll be with you in a couple of minutes. over."
"okay, while guidance is - let me give you some angles. we had a verb 06 noun 20 that was done at 94:20:20. the lm angles were plus 29465, plus 28996, plus 35502."
where was that clean yesterday?
it started.
you want to giye me that piece of paper?
"yeah. if i push it up on my middle finger, it ain't going to fall off. i won't even know it's there."

okay.

"twenty-one, you - -"
mark it.
i wish i knew what was wrong with him.
_nere it should be.
"roger. and just one minor point. across the top, on the velocity to be gained, you can bias all those n,_mbers - add a six to every one of them across the top, to be technically correct."
yes. look out your window. is that it?
"is that all we get to eat? 03 12 30 01 imp yes, i think so...."
"hey, jack, it looks to us on the tv as though you're m - anchoring the geophone module with a flag."
*** fit in there?
that's affirmative.
a]most does.
(laughter)
"okay. i'm hearing you now, and the noise has come up again, but it will go down."
"houston, endeavour."
"it's - amazing how you can trip over - how you can be going along and trip over a rock, and i'm one of these guys that always looks down and it's - and still seem to be able to trip them going forward."
what's the number?
"and stu's mentioned if you hadn't earlier, that you might try the binoculars when you look at copernicus for that dike you said - if you hadn't thought of it before."
"okay, ron. we'll give you a word here."
"yes, it's almost zero. oh (laughter) i was look- ing at cabin pressure."
as long as the brakes hold out - -
that means we're leaving tomorrow.

okay. we'll do it and we want to be sure we talk back and forth now to make sure we get this burn off right.
"let me know when it comes down up there, will you?"
"dick, the eva - eva is going pretty well; they're 2-1/2 hours into it; and they've got the alsep a good way deployed. apparently, both of them look as though they just crawled out of a coal bin. other than that, seems pretty much nominal."
counterclockwise is thataway.
"okay. now, the question that you had for me was that if - if any of the meters do not go into the green, we turn the power on. did you want me to te_ the box, and then do what?"
"*** you work yourself out of that crater to your left. if you try to come up like i did, you're -"

"jim, a word on that core stem. when one of you takes it in - into the lm, you can stow it on the floor against the mid-step, the z-27 bulkhead."
"endeavour, houston. we're recommending a half of a degree per second for your maneuver. you've got quite a ways to go."
(yelling) what?
okay. a little north bias.
roger that.
"okay, you were a little broken up there, jim, but i think it's getting better. we are ready for the launch-vehicle-systems debriefing whenever you are."

okay; and you've got 5 minutes here.
i can get the pictures. is it directly out of window 5? okay. we've got about another minute and a half. i'm going to proceed here at 41.
"okay, dave. we'll get it next time: no problem."
"jim, could we yaw right a little bit and point that omni right at you, would that help?"
okay. watch my diverter min.
"()kay. and that summarizes my next line, it just was ""flashing 16 85,"" then ""spacecra_pt control to c_mc""and it was just trying to get across what i just told you in words; and, if you made the burn, why, null your residuals."
"i've got a rock about 2 meters in diameter, partially buried - that one of the probes may be near."
evidently you found the right boulder.
okay.
"i don't know. these engines condition you for it. in gemini - no, i'm serious. in gemini, there was nothing except the agena that gave you any thrust vector, and you never used it that much anyhow. we been in and out of the g-field pretty good. when we came down after 8 days, we got up to about two-tenths of a g and i thought i was pulling four g's - no shit."

"okay. 236:50, right?"
"okay. for ken, he had from meal c everything but the pecans, and he ate his sandwich and his orange juice. his prd is 15030. six hours in an 8-hour period; he was awake every - once every hour. okay. excuse me."
"well, i guess every once in a while we wonder."
"oh, yes; that's much better. okay, i'm going to come around this way today. little easier."
"joe, why don't you give - give me the block data, and then we can go on that geology brief?"
"***, jack? wait a minute."
"okay at 263:55, we'll add a step there after noun 70, x-ray to standby; and then, at 263:59, we'll delete the verb 48 and also delete the dap load that's in the time colm,mn. _' 10 21 52 18 cc roger. turning the page to 264:02, the dap - load in the time coll-_u should read lll01. and at 265- -"
"we have the csm hatch out, the drogue and probe removed and stowed, and we're just abeut ready to open the lm hatch now."
"houston, this is jack. the pugs was erratic. it's the only thing i noticed that was offnominal. it - it bounced around a lot, in bouncing arou - it was initially for about a minute - around - oh, 1.8 decrease, then it gradually started to diverge from that to a more decrease, down to about 2.5 or make that 3 decrease. and i went to decrease on the switch; and about the time of crossover, i had it at - oh, about i decrease and it crossed over and stabilized at zero, and i went to normal and it stayed there the rest of the burn - until just near the end, it started to go decrease again."
"roger, jim. we're trying to improve our comm down here. we'd like to try going function switch from down voice backup to voice. over."
"here's a flat place, sort of."
"apollo 15, this is houston. we need po0 and accept to give you a state vector and a target load, and we'll up-link when we get the next omni. _"
"god, you look pretty. yes, you just got a small stub, ron. probably not more than a couple of feet."
okay. close the hatch.
okay. that baby's open.
"okay. we're looking back at a - a very full ar.d very bright, very beautiful moon, righ_ now. ._d the man in the moon is smiling as he's waving us on home."

"it's about 30 degrees of travel, charlie, from the closed position, which is with the arrow pointing at about three to three-thirty, four o'clock."

okay. turn around and i'll get your bag. the other way. the other way. right there.
"i figured the gold team might do that. you know, i've woke up to a lot of pleasant thoughts, but never to an aggie before."
i'm going to leave this chair flat.
"yes. oh, here comes ... that terminator is just like something out of the movies."
"let me do that one more time. the aft is fine, that's for sure."

"sure do. and we're heading right straight for it on a bearing of ll degrees (laughter), except for the wanders through the craters."
"and, guys, you might look through those again, and - if you have any questions, please come right back to us with them."

"very closely spaced. and - it has the same direc- tion as the dipping beds i mentioned yesterday that intersected the horizontal beds or water - high water marks that dave just talked about, when we looked at the spur on high hadley."
"(laughter) well, i tell you, every time i zero in ! on the optics, i m-we about 50 checks of all the switches in here."
shaft and trunnion look good.
"i'd like - i'd like to get a mag of that, too. start eating it...."
"okay. okay, you want it on vertical. pick up my ops hose."
i didn't - i didn't realize we wore you out.

"sure glides at one-sixth, doesn't it?"
starting down. starting down.

"and, houston, surgeons may be inveresvea to know cmps blue bag number 5 was comparable to grouna mest number 3."
"okay, ken, we're about 4 minutes from los. every- thing's looking good on this end, and just to pass on something about the guys on the surface, they've got a real good view of south ray from where they are, and they say that - that - that the crater - the ejecta from south ray is two different kinds of material. there's some dark material and then the light material that we call ray material, so he said there's other ejecta right along with it in all directions, where there's dark and light."
"okay, and it's going in bag 17."
the last couple of questions are in a lighter vein for ron evans. there has been a lot of discussion about missing a pair of scissors in the command module. who really lost the scissors?
"houston, apollo 16. over."
"okay, bob. i'll find it. 234/2.1."
i have vox now. vox sensitivity is up. pad c0_'s off. s-band's t/r. audio mode is normal. *** t/r. am's off.
"the reason i ask, ken, is for this p52, i need to be close to the right attitude to pick up the stars. 03 22 22 35 cml° it's the same set of time-line procedures we've been using."
"okay, here we goo what a super flying machine!"
"i understand your problem. separate, simultaneous communications in use link between cc and cm o6 o9 59 -- _egin lunar rev b9"

sure as hell can.
"(laughter) you got it' they didn't make the string quite long enough. okay? where is it?

(laughter.)"
whatever that means.
"and one additional weather report, i'm sure you're interested in. the weather in your primary landing area is looking great, and we anticipate no weather avoidance maneuvers whatsoever. things are great out there. and i'm thinking of going out and en- listing the apollo 17 chaplain, so we can maybe get some warmer weather for your arrival back here on thursday."

"okay. the first one is at 281:02 - 281:02. change the call ""manually roll left"" to ""manually roll left 60 degrees to a roll angle of 071."" we want 60 de- grees in a roll angle of 071."
"15, houston. our records show that you will be out of nikon film when you finish the lunar eclipse photography, and we'd prefer that you use it for the lunar eclipse."
"okay, we're in att i/rate 2, just in case we need it."
get your visor?

"okay, start 21 and no noun 88s."
"i guess we'd like you to just go ahead with your first lunar meal. i guess that deserves some champagne, i don't know."
"one minute, 305_ looks good. 124 on the h-dots 50 - -"

"roger, 17. we copy that."
you're the one that has to get behind it and try to talk to houston.

"okay, then we won't worry about that. okay, houston, as you know, the one i have the most trouble getting is that mirror in the middle which i understand is just a nav system anyway. but i got it as best i could and it's a lot cleaner than it was."

"i can't. no .... 10 02 27 43 _ how's that? there we go. now we should get our positions straight. you see it now, dave? okay. make sure we got a good seal."
"okay, falcon; endeavour. i'm getting some large updates on you there, dave, on the first mark."
right.
"well, the problem is, no matter how carefully you let go, you bump it just a tiny little bit and set it in motion, and once in motion there she goes. try that again."
"roger, jack."
roger. apollo ll is ready to copy tli plus 90.
"roger; on november there, it's - the seconds, 11.81. over."
put them under my seat.
"okay. okay. i'm still coming up, coming up."
why don't you go up a click and let us have a look at that.
"okay. we're at the sco x-1 attitude, as you knc_."
yeah. did you see that big thing coming down?
"okay, that's fair."
"roger, 15. thanks for the description, and the picture we're .getting down here is quite good also."
"that's affirmative. and that also prevents you from activating that saturn dap. okay, at 97:44, right after - right be - prior to the verb 49 maneuver there, put in ""load d._p,verb 48 (10101) (xllll.)"""
i'll be with you in 30 seconds.
a little better.
oh. 326
"must have been. 02 09 45 1i cc 17, houston. over."
okay.
"roger; we'd like you to use sysvem a _usv as long as possible. over. 0l 03 19 _$ cdr-lm okay, system a is - system a is now ope2_, crossfeed is open, and systb: e is closed. oh 00 20 07 cc and, orion, have you loaded the ags abor_ constants; ye_ ? 04 00 20 !!_ lhp-lm negative. 02 00 20 15 cdr-i/_ that's negative. over. oh 00 20 17 cc okay_ understand negative. 04 00 20 i3 lbip-lm we don't have the ags up yet, jim."
yes.
"yes, sir."
"all right, just a second. you're supposed to go to roll, 180, 269."
"fsrward cabin dump valve, open, then auto at 4-1/2. 03 23 54 59 imp okay."
sound a little weak over there. 10 04 21 b3 cdr we're smoking in there.
roger.
"okay, gordy. it's a little better."
okay; we copy that.
"apollo ll, houston. go ahead. over. (goss net 1) tape 6/5"
copy.
"the clock is running. pan camera self test to on (up). talkback barber pole, to five frames, and then gray."
"say, ron. you want to - actuator handle select lock to l."
okay.
0kay_ that's 197:14:18 for the pan camera to be running. we'll get it.
yes. i don't even see where the cue-card part of the data card kit is.
"roger. well, when it was retracted, you wouldn't be able to see it. that's what i'm asking. is it possible for you to take a look now and see if it slowly comes in to view?"
"jim, you'll get your feedwater tone shortly. 05 04 56 49 i_p-eva okay, i did. time to go to aux-water, huh?"
"and at - 79:42 right after the _lsf_i,update block there, add ""terminate emp 509 after p24 completed."""
save - save the film changing here. let me get you a bag.
okay. is it gray?
"okay. that's good information and during the time that we see you're continuing to pitch, if you ever get in a position where you think the aot might be of some use, wetd like you to periodically look out of it and see if you can see some stars that would enable us to get a p52."
four jets.
"go ahead, houston."
okay.
stand by.
...
fine.
you want a verb 58? 08 08 39 24 cml° is that what he said? 08 08 39 25 iatp i don't know.
okay. sounds good.
i don't think so.
yress reg a and b to egress?
"i got you, bob."
"roger. copy, fred."
huh?
saw a couple of flashes.
"okay, karl; i'm ready to copy."
we'll be waiting for you. we're here.
you guys should maintain radio silence up there.
okay.
waiv until he gets the sleee out of his eyes.
"and, john, verify you locked the forward hatch."
"hey, okay."
okay. - -
huh?
enter. wait a _[nute. we've got to load verb 25 - -
"that looks real good. yes, you're over mexico there, and looks like you're - oh - maybe a hundred miles south of the border there."
"- - the updata link, the dua breaker may not be in, jack."
okay. we copy that. you may bear back to the right about l0 degrees.
"oh, yes, let me have my tool."
mark's pretty happy too.
"go ahead, ken."
you want me to get my scoop under there? probably won't fall out.
that's great.
"no, that acts as a supplement to the surge tank. all right."
"got so many ... you can see all the - you know, you can see all the prominent features and little sharp craters like - i think i'm looking ay kepler. it's out there in the middle of the mare. it's just beautiful. and that's all earthshine."
"okay, dave, will you put these back in b-2 for me, please?"
"america, houston. we've got the flight plan update and a pan camera photo pad for the flight plan."
"okay. and for some reason here - we're sitting in reacq and narrow, and i can move the yaw - yaw - plot and - drive the antenna."
have you done the main reg check?
roger.
tranquility base. it's beautiful.
okay. there's one swath - about a meter long.
okay. let me go to the movie.
"okay, i got it."
that's exactly right. we did that for 10 days and never figured out why.
okay. oh - -
"ken, what do you want? we got a choice of scram- bled eggs, grits (laughter)."
that's it. don ev gloves. do a little grease in here.
at 3:55:54 - about 40 seconds - nonpropulsive vent will be opened on the booster.
i don't know which is the best way to do this here.
great. and we're standing by for that battery compartment reading.
"roger, dave. a couple of miscellaneous items i'd like to ask you about. first of all, the trench sends their congratulations to whoever's doing the p23 for us. the errors are less than 7 sigma - and they're awarding the honorary vasco da gama navigation award for excellence in this. secondly, we're puzzling over your remark about magazine romeo, which you reported to us was exhausted. and we're wondering if you just read - the frame number f_om the mag and, if so, what it read. over."
"houston, 15."
"oh, no. we're going to do the whole bit."
okay. we've got one bag left - we should have there.
"we've got about l0 more minutes of sampling, so why don't you just pick up what looks interesting to you there, and then we'll start closing out."
let's hope not.
okay. and it just dawned on me. i'm sorry about the zero on the noun 69. (laughter)
roger.
"i don't know what's the matter, but something is."
"roger. 09 09 0b 34 lmp hey, houston, 16. the lmp is on biomed now."
i will be unswayed by the facts when we get back.
okay. copy that.
"okay. okay, it's suggestive, but in the - in the final analysis - -"
"still looks kind of tinny to me. cdr-_d he's not going to have to do anything but thrust right into the - i might even get your roll angle zero for you by - by this maneuver_ okay, it's all yours_ c_ (laughter) okay, i've got her."
now let me get yours.
glass coated.
"well, th_k you. just a shot, you _ow, like maybe 30 seconds worth, then _uit."
"ken, houston."
"let me check something, though. on the way to - the hole-in-the-wall, we want to drive ..."
"no. it says ""remove center couch and temporary stow under the cdr couch."" now that ain't even in order."
"and when it's convenient for you, i've gos - - ci_p okay."
seven.
"... i don't know, charlie, ... i wouldn't think so."
"okay, gdc is aligned. stab control breakers. ail in and good shape."
"oh, okay. well, then, we - we've got three groups and when al soloes, he's going to use single bank b just like he's always done with the circuit breakers with cb sps pilot valve b in at the be- ginning of the procedures. is that right? f"
maybe it'll clean some of that dirt out.
"i keep being afraid, like in the simulator, to let go of my book; it's going to fall down on the - -"
say again.
"okay, houston. i forgot to release the docking latches. okay. i'll go up and release the docking latches i and 7."
well.
he's coming to us on b.
roger. there are the torquing angles. are you picking them up?
okay. we'll look at the frame count when you get to station 3.
"no, i sure don't. we never stopped between the lm - - 09 21 35 02 imp no, i mean between - say, up on stone mountain and at the lm."
"oh boy, we really do use descent water, though. we're down to 85 percent right now."
"roger, fred. readback correct, and we're getting a nice color tv picture now. if you have any commentary to go with it."
"this has been your docking practice flight, stu."
"yes, sir."
"aquarius, houston. you're watching the middle gimbal there, aren't you? go ahead, aquarius."
"okay. we have a good gdc alinement. all right, we're going to maneuver, leader."
"you've lost your chance to take this one, jim."
"john was reading the checklist, and ken was down there - we couldn't even see him, and all of us - every once in a while, a hand would come through this mass of beta cloth and mapping camera cas- settes and things, and reach out and grab something."
okay. how did our ... configurations appear to be working down there?
wilco.
roger.
"stick this in here. now, hold that section for me. - 06 20 34 41 lmp-eva okay. did before."
"well, i think they've just fallen a couple of times, and they're black all over."
"(la,_ht er )"
the mesa is touching the ground. the old low ...
does that mean i'm clear to do a verb 46?
okay.
"looks like a vesicular, very light-colored porphyry of some kind; it's about l0 or 15 percent vesicles. i'm right in front of the lm. they - quite a few of the rocks look of that type. sort of a pinkish hue to them. the texture is coarse, but i'm not sure how crystalline they are, yet. okay; back to work."
"ail right, sport. i'm going to head -"

real weird.
got a good mag? why don't you check it out and see if it runs?
"okay, we're coming off the ... c_ i just need that one visor down, don't i?"
"hope you can make it, geno, without that."
"hatch is closed, barely."
"okay, al, the first thing when you get to the central station - is vo check tlhe alinement an2 verify the alinement and leveling."
"what happened to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5?"
that's right.
"pardon me, ron. i missed that."
"man, that - i think we're probably pitch 20 and roll 20."
"goldstone should be getting about the best picture of the earth we can give them right now_ charlie. 01 06 58 _13 cc roger, mike. thank you much."
"okay, vance, it isn't - we're not looking into the sun - what we are getting is a large reflection from the sun behind us off the lm; and it is - it is coming on that quad i there, and that quad is reflecting back into the sextant."
that's all right. i want to get this closeup here.
yeah.
"okay, 13. we'd like to have you give us those systems test readings on fuel cell 1 and 3, please. ilma t)f: _j¢)/, ,) }'ag,e 17)_"
just need a wider chart is all.
i never had to pro out of it before.
"feels good to me, too, to get that over."
it was great.
14 - -
okay. we copy that.
it's a good one.
"here, i'll get it."
"0kay, this is oene. i:ve got a - a very inter- esting crater out in tranquiility i'd like to pass some info on for you - to you on. it's about in the central part of tranquillity. it's got a very sharply raised lip_ and it's got some very dark - rough rimmed deposits. it's got a - a very, very obvious .o. furrow_ looks like it's elongated, basically to the - generally to the east and to the west. i can't te!-i_ bu_ because of the shape of it_ and because of those a °.. darker rim deposits i'm sure there must be a vent there some- where_ but it's too dark down in there, i c_'t really see for sure whether there is one or no_. but_ if there is_ i imagine it's pretty big. _d i can't tell_ it's only sort of intuitive, but i imagine the elongation was produced during the thrust of the initial dynamics, the formation of the impact_"
"okay. coming up on the 88-hour mark. i'1] _iw, you a 2-second delay. stand by to mark."
"joe, this is 15 again."
"i don't know who's going to do it for you, ed. i c_'v get over there, and stu's going to be getting h_s suit on. you better - turn them off before you leave."
"maybe you can see mine, dave."
okay. you gonna - 06 22 00 3h cdr-eva gotta reset the uv.
i certainly agree.
"say again, charlie. 06 05 06 11 i2_p-e_ia i'll bypass - no, i'm on 9 -"
got it?
roger.
"yes, burn time is 9.6. clock's right on."
wait a minute. let me have the - l - the boost cards back. it's got the tli no-go's on it.
"ron, we're ready for pan camera power to off. and did you go to heaters after you set the self test switch to self test, when we started this?"
"okay, john and charlie. we'd like you to press on with the - the eva work. if we mess with that s-band any more, we'll do after the eva. i've got a note here. i don't know whether it's right or not, but it says that you won't be able to hear the yaw motor."
"hello. loud and clear, 17. we're with you."
... is still on. (eagle )
"pcm, lo."
which way?
okay. r_ere's one right under there. it looks like a good - a good samp - a good bet.
"apollo 12, houston through hawaii. how do you read?"
"and there's a rock box that's full of rocks. 04 22 45 05 imp okay. that looks good, pete. could we - put it in any other way? better put it in the middle - it's going to be right on that seal. there, it's in there okay. that'll do it."
...
...
okay; cover that - copy that.
"- - with the light material around it. now that's what it looks like in the - in the darkness. and then on the - let's see - southwestern rim of it, it almost looks like you've got a breach of the dark albedo stuff going out to the southeast corner of it in two spots. okay, then the light stuff turns into - how do you put it - a darker swirly looking type stuff as you continue on west of reiner gamma. it crosses kind of a wrinkle ridge, i can see a wrinkle ridge down there, now. it crosses the wrinkle ridge with the no - no apparent change in albedo, anyhow, as it crosses the ridge."
roger.
... i'll tell you.
"okay, start telling me."
okay. that's for future reference then.
glad to hear it.
"roll 232; that's a long way to roll, ... yaw is 62 ..."
"mark. then that goes - well, let's see, i'll come back and catch the pan camera, operate. 03 08 37 34 cml° okay."
not yet.
"okay. we want it in low, you say, jack - jack?"
nothing like this; i don't think i've ever seen a -
(laught er) you're right.
"okay, let's change this to roll, ll5; pitch, 297; yaw, 0."
yes.
yes.
"high bit rate. what a dope! 05 22 39 19 lmi° okay, go. if we start new, maybe i can do better."
right.
got it?
"and, 13, in the csm, we want to verify that all the fuel cell pumps are off, and we want to have you turn off the 02 fans in the tank 2."
....
"let me read you all the steps as i've got them, jack, and make sure we've got them right .... ascent eca, two, closed. step 2 will now be bat 6, normal feed, on. step 3, bats 1, 2, 3, and 4, off/reset."
"okay. and the residuals on p47 at undocking were zero, minus 0.1, and zero."
"okay, copy 475."
"and, dave, give us a call as you come up toward spur - -"
"90 degrees at 26.5. we're coming right in there, john. perfect. you want a lunar rock as a souvenir? they'd never miss it."
"- - everybody's in good shape. 12 07 08 28 r okinawa, recovery has a recovery beacon contact, bearing 175 magnetic. on station. 12 07 08 34 oki okinawa here."
"oh, yes. all right around the top. 07 21 24 15 t_p ..."
let me get around it. we can go a little bit further.
do you have the speed amps?
"this is our new garbage can down here, huh? good."
okay.
"fine. 07 17 12 54 cdr-e4 okay; b ascent feed 2, open. i can feel them in the floor when they go."
"hey, ineideutly, the backroom is really impressed. they are very excited about your choice of sampling on that inner wall of that crater - i guess it was at 5 or 6 - and think that you did - you had a good chance there of getting real descartes. in fact, they think they've got it in the box. what they're thinking right now is that the mat - the areas where you're able to kick up and see white under- neath are ray materials. but you didn't see that at 5 and 6. so, we think we may - you may have got descartes there."
"roger, jack. we copy that."
any suggestions?
"okay, sir. you ready to go on up?"
"i copy that, geno. good luck."
"okay, everything on the lm back side looks clean, just the surfaces of the - are flaked with the paint that are ..."
"roger. wondered if you're going to shoot a little pool today with colorado fats, there."
"yes, sir."
"it's a steep slope, isn't it? yes, i think we can ma- it. no, it's another fresh crater."
"what's the matter, charlie?"
"charlie, what piece of gear would you like first?"
yes.
"roger, trying to get one."
"roger, geno."
"yes, it is unlocked. lnp-eva okay. now push down and turn."
"and, jim, i just have to ask you, did you notice if the contact light came on or not?"
"forget it, al."
"me, either. what is it? just targets of opportu- nity out through there?"
"roger. and at 202:25 - 08 09 14 02 cm_ okay. just a second, i had - we hadn't updated our time this far. well, we're going to get a clock sync here when we - -"
understand. we have it.
yes_ we sure do. putting the map away.
"roger. po0 and data. go, data."
"i guess the question - i'm not sure if we got the right question and answer together. can we do the ptc refsi_{at platform change in the sco x-1 atti- tude? maybe that's the question you answered, i'm not sure."
anybody get that?
okay. we're just about to go to 50 percent. descent 02. we're there.
roger. understand you've scrubbed midcourse 1.
"no, wait a minute."
*** the pro.
"okay, and on panel 9: power to off. over."
120 degrees roll.
"y'all know how good that - water stuff tastes. ah! try to get way down there, john, and get a - uh-oh."
turn all the floods up all the way.
copy that.
"hey, bob, i'm looking at what - what jack was talking about; and it's definitely not a particle that's nearby because there is another one i can look at and get a three-dimensional comparison with. it is a - it is a bright object, and it's obviously rotating because it's flashing. it's way out in the distance, as i say, because there are particles that are close by and it's obviously not one of those. it's apparently rotating in a very rhythmic fashion because the flashes come around almost - _]_ost on time. and it's as we look back at the earth, it's up at about ll:00 about - oh, maybe l0 or 12 earth diameters. i don't know whether that does you any good, but there is something out there."
"now, this ought to shield that thing from the doggone -"
roger. we're ready to copy.
"roger. apollo 17 air-to-ground voice transcription 04 17 30 17 i2mp-lm okay. the lmp has got the rcu connected to tt,eplss."
steering is good; gdc ball's good; needle is good.
he looks bigger than 800 feet.
that's an interesting observation.
*** some cooling?
okay. are you ready to go back to it now?
"apollo 11, houston."
roger. two minutes from los.
okay.
"all righty. pad echo: 113:02 all zeros; foxtrot: _ plus 1013.4, plus all zips, minus 0050.0; golf: 113:57:00.00; hotel: 115:36:45.00. india: 112:49:52.35. juliett: 115:36:45.00. kilo: 117:35:45.00. lima: 113:14:24.91; mike: 119:34:30.00; november: 114:57:19.09. over."
area around the two spacecraft is cleaned up pretty well by now. there are just a few fragments moving around.
i think it's - i'm sweating.
"i still can't copy you, orion. i'm sorry about this. the quality is very poor here."
okay. say again the longitude.
"go ahead, tony."
i'm not sure if they have any of our beverage packs or not. i think they are all packaged in these expandable little things we're using for water - water cans.
roger. that's great news.
"okay. i'm not sure i can even drink coffee for you, ken. how about a cup of chocolate?"
sorry.
okay.
okay; good show.
"apollo 16, houston."
okay. we'll do so. thank you very much. but we'll be there in any event by 00:41.
mark lmp. flash; position 2 on the periphery; right eye; intensity 2.
gainstep to shield on.
"okay; hang on a minute,"
"the cabin repress valve, that is."
"well, i think it is in as good as i can put it back in, houston. but i wouldn't be surprised to see it hanging out some day."
roger. and i - i - think you know that we'd probably - that we - we don't want to go into those operations until we have got into the correct attitude.
"okay, and we're in the maneuver."
"roger, geno."
right.
"okay, charlie."
"ron, the hot fire checks are complete. you can go into wide dead band, att hold."
"oh, that thing."
okay.
"yes, i hate black and white."
"high gain, medium."
"hey, i'll tell you what we're parked next to."
they look a little large right now.
"and that's not on the map, either. it doesn't even show up. i guess - i guess my opinion of this place is that on our - on our traverse maps, the rimless features - the very old, subdued, rim- less craters - they just don't even show up, and they're just not there hardly."
how do you read_ _r_erica? you're sounding great now.
standby numbers are the same as the ground numbers.
"apollo 11, this is houston. go ahead. over."
i think the constraint to landing is you.
"roger. go ahead, fred."
"i_ey, get a bag for me, charlie. 07 00 25 01 lr.p-eva 0_eay."
"the residuals of noun 85 at the time we quit burning were plus 0.2, plus 0_2, and minus 0.1. i'll give you +_he angles. noun 20: 270.08, plus 011.74, plus 001.94."
yes. right. okay.
"loud and clear. i was just ... to houston, right now."
"okay, endeavour, i guess we're ready to start. i want to put one final note on the subsat launch. we'd like for you to reverify for us the talkbacks on the rcs after the launch."
right. a mickey special.
excuse me.
"well, i was - the answer is yes and no at various times. we think, though, we have a good handle on the problem."
"okay. camera's stopped, houston."
i've got it.
roger; copy. tape _7/2
"we have a tallyho on shorty - i mean of van serg. how about through there, geno. thanks."
"roger. t-start, 121:03:59."

right up to - the swan range there.
what am i going to run it to?
"okay. well, that's what we're going to do. i just wondered if those - if secondary was okay for you."
"well, if you - are you talking about over the dovetail part of it, or are you talking about off the aft end of the - of the vehicle?"
okay. that - that's what we ...
go.
i be a sorry bird.

should came over the horizon.
that's right.
"okay, ron. that - that completes the visuals on this pass. we - if you want to look some more, we've got some time. we do have some flight plan camera pads and all that, but no hurry on any of it."

check. get the old hinge pins - oop! out ....
"no, jack's still sacked out."
"yeah, 09:07. 00 01 28 15 cml° and it vas - yeah. and it was - the thing that bugged me vas that the pogo or the buzz that we got in the s-iv was the same frequency; makes me think maybe that was coming from, not from the booster, but from the understage or something like that. because it was a - i would have expected to, you know, to get a frequency change, wouldn't you?"
yes. 03 08 52 47 _ okay.
"no. it's funny how for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction, isn't it?"
i'll - i'll drop your seatbands in just a second there.
i don't. doesn't look like we'll get to use it.
"man, i am straight."
"houston, this is nell. how do you read? (tr_q)"
pgns and ags are looking good.
"that's a good idea. in fact, i'd like to wipe off the front of your suit in a couple of places. the only place you haven't got dirt is on - on your neckring."
"hey, don, you really can get some pretty stable initial conditions."
"- - yes, yes. _-_"
"yes, and there she came. i saw it."
"okay; that's good. beautiful, beautiful. right on the money. 06 01 31 _l imp-eva you can use that sound to lock in, dave. 06 01 31 h4 cdr-eva you know i did that, i didn't even look at that ·..; i just used your agc. all right. 06 01 31 49 i/_p-eva you also get the sound when you're locked on, too. 06 01 31 51 lmp-eva/ ... cdr-eva"
okay. let me picture this here where my big foot went.
"that's right, that's what they just said; they don't want that one."
"roger. 5 by, jim, and we're sailing free."
apollo 16 through canaries. how do you read?
"okay. 0_ 03 54 48 lmp that looks like it, john. oh, you want to go to - oh 03 55 04 lmp okay; we close. show 0.68 miles, 0 feet a second,"
"don one glove and lock. okay_ following that, panel 603, eva 02, off; and then don the other glove and lock it."
okay. okay.
okay. understand.
lm suit pressure locked up at 4.5. okay. some- thing about the watch.
coming right up.
"yes, sir. it's certainly an unusual thing; and, furthermore, it's very strange how this upper sur- face here has flaked off behind the - behind the - docking target, which i guess you - you can't see that on the tv. i couldn't see it on the monitor. can you see it on the tv?"
roger. we have our update at the state vector _ut there for you. reluest po0 and accept. dver.
go ahead.
"okay, houston. we're at the bottom of 1-8, and i'm standing by for your lift-off times."
"okay. a_ 230:20, ""laser alti?._ter, off."" at 230:29_ add ""verify all _f, off."" at 230:31, delete ""waste wkter dump."" at 230:40, scratch out ""lmp"" and put ""cdr don biomed harness."" jusv put ""cdr"" in place of ""l_."""
say a little word about this -thing.
"well, i can't get behind to see the monitor. i'll bring the focus in, but we're going to be looking down past one of the lm quads and one of the antennas almost straight down at the ground track that we'll be seeing coming in now. i guess there's maybe 2 or 3 minutes before power descent. 03 06 45 37 lm]_ all right, that should put the _i structure about in focus, and i'm going to move it out to infin- ity and then expand the field of view."
"ron, we're coming up on 5 minutes to los and just want to update you. we went around the room, and the spacecraft is looking great. we just have one reminder and that's at the end of the solar corona period. please use only one protect frame - one protect frame per the flight plan or per the check- list. and the other thing is - the lunar sounder - the little check you did at the beginning of this pass - the recorder is pulling film as normal. the glitch we saw was a telemetry grit - glitch and the lunar sounder is looking great."
"don't move out of that - your shadow. no. i got a big - is that glass, or is that basalt? look at that frag there. let me take a picture from where - it came from under that rock. 06 01 51 06 i/_p-eva think so?"
"yaw 2, mark -"
"okay, the s-band _a_ntenna,open."
"it's broken. see, it's flipped off up there."
roger. good night ali.
"a big hunk of south ray. right? they're the same rocks and everything. aridwe're traversing it right now. it's a big rough - big old blanket full of south ray material. 07 00 52 i0 lfp-eva look at those big rocks up on the - off to the west there, john, up on the - you probably can't see them, but there are about 10 - stand out starkly against - -"
"okay. heaters display, eps display open. and i've long since had all the lights off, floods, et cetera."
"yes. much fewer. not any at all, now. i'm not sure whether that vent gave me reverse yaw and roll - left roll - that's - if that's what it gave me."
okay. i think i'll take the - go out of the retract position on the switch and just wait for your word.
"well, i wouldn't be surprised but what a big im- pact crater wouldn't - wouldn't change your magnev- ic field some. 07 00 _3 23 lmp-eva tony, my impression right now could be proved totally wrong on the sample read - analysis, but -"
yes.
... be chipped.
"looks like it's in attitude now. 00 o1 18 2h cmp well, it is. i just don't want that little bugger to blow up back there, and get a leak - -"
"roger, char!ie. and they are not quite ready with those up-links."
okay.
"nol n-o, no. /- iaip alderbaran is your star. oh! do you read me?"
"aquarius, houston."
okay.
okay. it's plus 0.26. over.
"go ahead, houston."
reach?
cabin pressure's are ...
yes. that last rock box.
yes. *** and i'll be on my way - work on the toe. *** it.
"hadley base, this is houston."
you're getting ... for a ...
yes.
"yes. we got plenty of time. this is a long haul. 05 23 10 59 _ yes. i know it. this is a good one. just trying to get organized, here."
"27. i'm going to take an r-dot right here. clipper, that'd be 253, 254, 252, clear, 503, minus 0s 2540."
"okay. aha, here's another chart d."
"yes, sir. you're nice and protected. okay. good velcro."
"all righty. starting with bat c: 37.0, 37.0, 37.0; rcs a is 56, b is 50, 48, and 52. and i guess everything else has been done, and you should have got your e-memory dump. we pressurized the cabin with the ops, and when we got to about 57 or 58, the ops was down to 800. and i reckon that's the size of it."
"i'll block the sun from - impinging on the instru- ment panel. 04 1047 03 cc well done, jim."
roger. over.
"i thought there was one here. ob 08 28 28 cmp i think you was going to put it on the flight plan. okay. there 's one here, dave. ob 08 29 25 cdr ... that waste water's something that's got to go. certainly have a lot of it."
"oh, i see. okay, we'll close it after a bit here."
"let me just - i can see down there,"
okay.
yes.
very well.
it would help.
yes_ it is.
"shovel width, and it's all the same material. and i don't see any layering in it or anything."
"3-d, al."
...
"okay. how are we in respect to the cable? 04 18 17 45 l_ i'm afraid you're too far away. 0b 18 17 _9 cdr well, i wanted to get maximum length. i'm moving on in. 0b 18 17 53 l_ that's better. let's see. yes, i want to do that, too. %confident,"
okay. i'm with you.
"okay, i've got my one glove locked. one of them - one of the old fist covers."
you can stick that in the ground if you -
"okay. you'll be in the configuration plus-x for- ward, and will be taking g_mma ray, x-ray, and alpha particle data, data during rev 60. we want you to do at 19b plus 45, a p52 option 3. and we're going to add a map and pan camera pass sometime during rev 60. and i'll be coming at you with the necessary data for that. also -"
okay. i guess now is as good a time to start as any.
we got to pitch to 152.
"okay, joe, i'm ready to start the - experiment."
"okay, we got everything - we're yaw at zero. 04 14 16 56 lmp-_ okay. at 7 minutes, 67's your angle, 26 - 27; that's great ... - -"
"the other can is down. a jett bag. i mean, the bplss bag."
"- - we've got los on the clipper, and we'll see him at 13."
"okay, i'm approaching. your attitude looks good. i'll tell you when we have capture."
that's verified.
"falcon, this is houston. over."
"okay, john. here's a - !ooky here. can we whack with a- hey, that's - look at that. see, it's glass coated, and this is just fractured off. we could pull that off. big chunks of that'll come right off."
that's affirm. check mtvc.
"and, bob, this is gene. i can confirm that it did not fold back easily, because i - i checked it yesterday. i didn't check - i checked to see that the hooks were over as well as where the handles would fold back, but i obviously didn't check to see whether that one was seated. but the handle was locked."
and we'll need emu checks.
"okay, jack, if you haven't put magazine hotel on, we want to recall that amd make it magazine golf - gail."
"casper, would you give us accept, please?"
yes.
okay.
"... okay, wait a minute. thc - trans control power - we need rot control pow_q direct, two, main a/ main b - should have already had all that."
"no, sir. i'm here."
we sure agree.
"okay, understand, joe."
okay.
okay? okay. now we need boulder stuff.
"well, i was happy until you said it again. okay. i've got voice, on; data, on, off, and low."
did that co2 drop?
"okay, vance. we're in data and po0 and the circuit breaker's in. go ahead."
"right, it will be the 0.5 - well, actually you have the 0.2 on there. why don't you do the string of 0.2_and then we'll come back and get the 0.5 near the double core."
"i have plus 2.8, and minus 0.3, plus 6.2."
... i'm right with you - -
"hello, houston. the recharge on the lmp: 95 percent."
"goldstone comm tech, net 1."
now how does that look to you?
"it's auto. cdr-i2_ okay; on 16, cabin repress, closed?"
"gordo, in reference to these boulders, everywhere _' i can see out of my left window and out ahead of me in referring to that boulder jack's talking about which is just a little bit on my side at 12 o'clock, it appears that the dark mantle has filleted and, for the most part, covered - or it has covered part of or is up on top of some of the crevices and the crannies in the boulders them- selves, with the exception of - well, i'll take that back - even the very small ones. i'd say from a population point of view, boulders of the size jack's talking about that are visible through the surface anywhere from i to 2 to 3 meters - a very small percentage, but when you look at them at our level, it looks like they are quite popu- lous. i'd say there are maybe about 25 of them in view between myself and the - where the horizon falls off down away from us towards the south massif. the area back towards station l, at least the other side of trident, looks like it's more heavily strewn with some of these filleted and partially mantled large fragments."
okay. go ahead now. i can hear better.
"roger, al. i'll tell you about that some time. and, 15, we're configured for the e-mod dump, if you fellows want to give it to us."
getting pretty good - getting the old ... in there.
"roger, eagle. coming in with the short count - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. houston out. over. 03 11 10 55 _ roger. are you copying my low bit rate? over."
okay. we're ready to follow.
"got you. i'm holding. and, houston, a1 can read you part of the time and not part of the time. i think it's because the relay's off over here, right now ...."
"what do you call tomato soup made with cold water, tony?"
(yawn) okay. connect the ops 02 hose.
pressure - pressures look great. tank 2 is down just a little from before.
"well, here's a spare - -"
how many pots has the mocr gone through already? tape _7/9
urine transfer.
"okay. 00 00 40 57 i24p you working on that one, dave?"
"eagle, this is houston. we see the optics zero switch on. before you take some marks, don't forget to cycle it back off and on, and then on. over. 04 ,0 50 12 lmp roger. houston, eagle here. i wish we had one of those optics. i'll tell mike _0out it."
"go 'ahead, challenger. zi_p roger. give us a call when you want us to go through the oormmconfiguration. amd we're going to leave the cabin fan on a little bit, keep airing out - filtering the cabin. _.d don't les us forget it."
(laughter) okay.
"charlie, you can go ahead and start getting that c_nera out. we'll work up .the lines here."
okay.
"well, we'll have plenty of them to give out. yes. we ought to save them for all the hookers in titusville (laughter). 00 00 46 04 i24p huh? he said we could either carry them grace- fully or otherwise."
"okay, houston. stand by. break. orion, i am in wide dead band, att hold. okay, i'll go free when you give me the call. break. houston, this is casper. go ahead."
- - this is an impressive one.
huh? oh - -
"okay; you're readable, fair amount of noise."
do you think it'll go in the scb number 2?
"apollo 15, houston. your gamma ray, gainstep, shield, off, please."
"orion, we read you much better."
okay.
"aquarius, this is houston. go ahead."
"mark 15 seconds to pan camera, off - on, pan camera, on. sorry."
okay. i got to get out of here first.
okay - -
"all right, houston. step 4, ags rate command cold fire, 4-jet secondary coil hot fire check. hey, ron, we're going to have some hot fires here."
roger. it's coming up. don't think i'd come all the way out here and not let you guys see the alsep deployment.
"and the bird looks great, and we 'll see you when we wake you up. you can sign off any time."
don't you use that in your iv?
*** these suits are *** these boots are sure ***
"okay. wide deadband att hold. that's what i'm on. and amer - houston; america, i missed t2 on."
okay.
"i guess that's basically true. i guess that's basically true, dave; however, they would like this little glass ball. you could also put it separately in a bag before you leave with the rover, or i guess they really wouldn't mind, if they know particularly what it is, if it was part of the sample - contingency sample."
"okay. we just talked it over, gordo. after the radar check, we went from voice/range back to voice on the vhf a."
"i don't know what to set it on - 74, i guess. we're not that far away."
"that's an alternative that in the - the heat of battle did not occur to me at the time. it should have, and it may have occurred to some of them."
"aquarium, l[ou_;i, on, how do you ready"
roger.
"very good. 04 22.49 40 lmp yes, i guess it does. get some of that loose stuff."
roger.
"oh, my fingers. they do not have the dexterity that they once had."
did they give jack any more procedures on com- maad module powerup?
"okay, chartie, hold still a second and let me get your - old plss strap tied down on here a little bit. 05 23 05 53 i/_p-eva 01d plss strap tiedown."
okay. perform the coarse aline function.
"oh, boy. that's going to be tough, al. i'd just head out toward doublet out there and let's lcok."
"okay; understand 293. you want to let - torque it, dave?"
just need to move a little bit.
"*** i can't see. my hands work just as well as my visor, as a matter of fact."
"okay. as you might have expected, front pages around the country are headlining last night's eva with photographs taken from tv monitors show- ing you and jack going about your tasks. i might add that the tv camera is really spectacular. it couldn't have been a clearer or more beautiful picture, both for fidelity and color. in other news, south vietnam's president thieu has sug- gested that all prisoners of war be released before christmas. he has also asked that all vietnamese parties be included in peace negotiations. south vietnam and the viet cong are now not directly rep- resented in the secret talks now under way in paris. meanwhile, kissinger met for more than 4 hours yes- terday with hanoi representative le duc tho. the two negotiators are expected to meet again this afternoon. the former president, harry truman, is still resting quietly, although his condition re- mains serious according to his doctors. american poet mark van doren died at the age of 78. he was a professor of literature at columbia and a winner of the 1940 pulitzer prize for his poetry. presi- dent nixon announced yesterday that he wants to extend price controls beyond the scheduled april 30 expiration date. he also plans to freeze new hiring, promotions, and pay increases for executives of the federal government, which doesn't affect us, i guess. the republican national committee has a new chairman."
"yes, i'm sorry about that, joe, but i'm pretty unstable without that seatbelt and there's a lot of feedback into the controller. --_"
okay. i won't do it yet.
read loud and clear on vox. okay?
that's auto.
"okay, i'll do it. okay, you got it - b data."
"roger. what are you looking at again, ron?"
"boy, that is great."
"ron, we're go for retraction on hf antenna 2, hf antenna 2. you're go for retraction."
"man, i never - (laughter) you can't believe how tough it is getting around this rover, on this slope."
"okay, we're going to block."
"yeah, i ain't do:se nothing right since i got out of bed this morning. 04 0! 31 02 cdr okay, we're getting - we're getting behind the time line probably -maybe."
"okay. and were those last high gain - i guess they're still good, huh? you want the high gain on it?"
"actually, you can see ..."
"i'm so d,_n happy; nobody could give me any better service."
okay.
"okay, unlock. brake is off. four is coming in. okay, bob, the upper - the upper 5 centimeter - 3 centimeters mixed with that upper half centi- meter, is the next sample."
i'm going up there.
"i tell you, houston. i'm just cool as a cucumber, and this sun is so bright you can't believe it."
we copy.
outstanding.
now5 let's see - -
yes.
roger.
okay. apollo 15 air-t0-ground voice transcription
how about the leb?
probably.
"l0 bravo, apollo."
"okay, high gain."
yeah.
yeah. 04 01 i1 31 lmp what do you think?
what?
"hello, houston. endeavour reads you loud and clear."
"oh, i know - hey, how about giving me - do i have g&n power at 8:217 00 00 41 07 i2_p yes, sir."

did you enjoy your hot meal last night?
okay. engine start.
okay. i'll torque it at 58:10.

"roger. i docked in cmc auto, and as i said, i wasn't really sure of the moment of contact. i kept cross-checking the docking probe indicators. i got two barber poles indicating that the three capture latches - not capture latches, but the three ... latches had made, and we were soft ((l,o,cll net ] ) q':,.pc 96/2 i'ttg,,, !,27 docked. and at that t'j]ne thc uit, uat, iou looked very stable. so, i went to cmofree, f_l_anccd back out the window and it still looked stable; and i fired primary 2 bottle. and at that time, a gyration began between the two vehicles due i'm not sure to what. perhaps the lm thrusting or perhaps it was building up prior, and i hadn't noticed it. but anyway, during the retract of the probe, there were yaw - my yaw excursions of, i would guess, around 15 degrees, and i had to ec_e hack on, take the free switch and throw it back to auto, and try to damp them out; and i guess neil was doing the same in the i_. i'll let him tell you about his side of it. and i though that we were not going to get a successful retract and hard dock. however, in about - oh, i guess 6 or 8 seconds, i did hear - could see the situation damping out, and then we heard the noise indicating the docking latches had fired; and later on when i got into the tunnel, all 12 of them had properly engaged."
couldn't be better.
off.
roger.
roger. we still don't have ...
its tracking's real good. f
"houston, the lm doesn't seem to be holding attitude."

"hardly room there, is there?"
whenever you're ready.
"roger. 10 i8 17 27 cc america, houston. we're going to have to have the high gain for the dump and also for a little additional work with the hf antennas and the sounder that we're going to read you here in a n_nute. so, in order to get it, we'd like you to pitch up 20 degrees in your present attitudes; and when you get there, then we ought to be able to reacquire and go narrow. _p okay. tape173/2"
"yes. yes. this rock box keeps wanting to go up in the air. oh, the heck with it. i think i'll put them in there."
one burn!

the src doesn't have to be all the way closed does it?
"okay, and if you turn over the page on power 8, we have the spacecraft functions remaining to you. we've got low bit rate tm. however, we don't have any vhf. we have cwea. we have glycol pumps. we have suit fans. we have cabin repress for you, and stand by in attitude control here. okay, 5n attitude control, we'll have hardovers for uses in emergency, and for normal usage we want to have a 15-minute delay to get th__ heaters on to warm them up be f'ore une. how do you read? 03 ]0 16 06 cdr okay. i.or emergency, we have the hardovers and for normal use it requires a 15-minute request to get the heaters on. 03 ]0 16 16 cc that's affirmative."

"well, but you were talking about changing station 5. i think station 5 is a pretty good spot."
it just got dark.
"and there's some beautiful north overhangs all around the block. well, (laughter) on the north side of the block."
all right.
got it?
that's correct. and i thought what i'd do now is reset to zero and start.
... counts.
"no, we're not there, al. we've got a ways to go."
okay. verify that the glycol was pulled?
"houston, 15."
roger. can you verify the position of the p - pu valve at this time for us?
roger. go ahead.
no.
bmagmodes to rate 2.
radar test to landing.
aren't you smart. _at you going to do with your hat7 04 0! 29 10 lm_ i don't know. _at's it doing down there?
roger.
"okay, real good."
"all right, sir. thank you."
"okay. at 239:30, those high gain angles should be minus 16 and 58."
you were counting the seconds; i was watching the clock.
okay. it's flowing again.
"okay, stand by."
al?
"oh, no; we're still at the same place."
(laughter) i think that's called a ch_rmion event.
roger .... on that.
"okay. the shot's been taken on the closeup, counter number 317. sun angle was 8 o'clock. the - this particular one is only about 12 feet long by about 4 feet wide. it's about one-third buried. it's old, very weathered. there are some evidences of some crystal shining through some of the fractures."
"well, i looked for him before, but couldn't see him, while i eot the monocular."
"looking good. (eaglz) (,4 0 r t8 09 cc roger, nell. we got a - if you will give us po0 and data, we've got the loads for you. r:!_ 04 18 kj ij_p okay. you've got it. po0 and data.

yes? yes.
"no, i'm continuing to push. yes, it's collapsedx"
"can we hold off on that a little bit, joe?"
"apollo 15, houston. about 2 minutes to mass spec boom deploy. and we'd like a delta-t on the length of time it takes to deploy it, please."
okay. i'll start my watch.
roger. look at it like this - -
"we're all set to go, mike."
roger_ gene. do you have a scale on the size of the crater?
"okay, karl, go ahead."
okay.
"oh, yes. you can see the slide on the thing and definitely see the scarp going across through there. i was primarily concentrating on looking for the various craters so i didn't spend that much time, you know, concentrating on how the thing looked. but in the marks on the thing, the first about four or five marks were on f crater and then i saw sherlock about halfway through it and i got about five marks on the sherlock for 17-1."
"okay. we'd like you to close inverter 2 circuit breaker, and select inverter 2."
okay. thank you.
"before you go out though, let me turn around so i can watch you."
"oh, oh."
"yeah. that was one right up there. uh-huh. yeah. that's 30 meters away - up there. getting out of this little crater is pretty, pretty hard; but after that it's - i think you'll be able to hack it."
stand by.

"oh, there are several of them, bob. what i'm talking about is about 100-meter-long lines where the boulder trains initiate and they are - there's one about - looks like about halfway - maybe two-thirds of the way down in perspective. another one that's probably about halfway - they're just sort of scattered around on the massif."
roger.
"go ahead, dave."
"roger. that's correct. on step 5, perform step 5. under ""primary glycol loop activation,"" step 1, line 1, ""cb(16) ecs: display - close."" that's a crew option; you can have it if you want to. omit the rest of step 1 and step 2. perform step 3. over. a ,i,oi3 air-t0-grotrj]_voice tr/h_i l'iption"

"16, houston. we'd like to proceed with the mulfunction procedure."
i'm watching it right now.
"three - no, that wrong. something -"
"(laughter) oh, that is a good thought. no, it's just that every once in awhile at these termina- tors, you know, you - you have some real good shots, and we just can't schedule them, you know, all the time, because sometimes you can't do it. but you take one or two shqts of each terminator when it comes by, you get some real good pictures."
... ready to capture that cable.
"it takes ... easy going to do it. i'll tell you that, because i got mad at them yesterday. didn't do any good. 07 22 20 _0 cmp well, that's right. it won't - won't alter any- thing except -- 07 22 20 _3 cdr tee the big boys off. 07 22 20 _4 cmp that's right. you get a speech from chris, and that's about what you have to look forward to when you - when you talk back. now i take my - now i know why the arabs eat with one hand and urinate with the other. they grew up in apollo."

roger. you're about 3 by; clear enough to understand.
it extended. it's there.
"that's affirmative, jim. after you get oriented in the attitude you want to burn in, do an ags aline which is - an ags body-axis aline which is 400 plus 5. when you get enter, this will bring ball up to 000, and i want to confirm that you - that you said engine gimbal off. 0-f-f. over."

maybe we better turn the heat up a little in here.
they will.
"oh, okay. this really is a posigrade burn is what you're saying. and i really won't be able to trim it?"

"okay. well, we'll go to tunnel vent for a little longer, must just be slow then; we've been in it for probably about 15 minutes."
"well, what i did the other night works like a champ."
"tony, how do you read?"
"okay. and when that's done, gene, we're ready for you and your dust brush to hasten back to the lm and dust each other and climb in."

"houston, 15."
"and the second c_e is it looks like we'll be delaying your mapping camera business at 150:10 in the flight plan, and we'll get back to you later on exactly what we'll be doing and when on that. and now if you'll turn to 151 hours, we have a mapping camera photo pad for you."
"no. sure don't. yeah. maybe there is. when we get closer to it, we'll be able to tell better. i see some funny shadows up on top of it."
"juice for you, charlie. what else do you need? 07 22 29 44 i_mp i might of been ... 07 22 29 50' cmp (laughter) well, i'm ready to say, at this point, i don't care· all they can do is tell me to ccme hcme, which they have already done· and they ain't gonna take my next flight away from me, so -"
roger. good idea.
"15, are you reading houston clearly?"
okay.
"let's see. we installed that the first day out, i think. and it's been on there ever since."

"i was just sleeping in my sleeping bag. i mean - all i had to do was get up and put on my - my jacket and trousers. up to then, just getting in the sleeping bag was almost too hot."

that's affirm.
"... is this your ..., jim?"
yeah. and then here's -
"roger, al."
"okay, we're starting out late, as you know; but there's nothing aheadthat we can see that's time-critical. so you might try to hurry a little, but don't - don't go to any great lengths to try to catch up with the flight plan. we can slip the _ telemetry activation without any problem. over. okay, we got you. our biggest problem this morn- ing is keeping ron from going back to sleep."
don't have any room there is right. any place we can put your bag on it? isn't your -
wow woozle i

there it is. see it - -
"okay, i will. yeah, that penetration rate was a little fast. thanks for reminding me. tony, if there is some way we could get that connector off of there, we might be able to take the be - take the whole - the electronics - naw, we can't do that either; the whole thing's hooked up."
"that's where it zeroed. yeah, it - it's still showing about the same numbers, hank. the biggest change was in the - no, they're all - they're all ball park, within readability, from one reading to the other. okay, so out of that, i come up with a '_fes""answer and i'm going - looking at block 12."
roger.
"already. cdr-e_fa well, let me just tweak you up a little bit. okay, i've got you tweaked, right in the middle."
"of course, we could screw up the - we could screw up the suit loop, couldn't we? if we - -"

"go ahead, houston. 03 04 h4 03 cc okay, we'd like to get the high gain, whenever you cazlcrank it up."

"okay, the reason for these changes, charlie, is after we watch mc-6 and look at the system pres- sures there, we got some new data; and, for your information, we're kind of predicting that your nominal values are going to be oxidizer 200, fuel 170, and - for your onboard readings. so based on that, we need to change these burn rules. and i believe you've already made one change to it, is that correct?"
that's sherlock over that rim over there.

what's the other question?

"3.1, is that all?"
"casper, houston. you're approximately 5 minutes from the mountains."
they may be talking to yankee clipper.
you hold - just hold the handle.
that's good.

come around behind my shoulder.
okay.
"okay, joe. on the shorting switch, i'm reading about .8."
(laughter)
okay. where do you want this trench? on the side of this crater?
... getting into the tv cable?
bruce. is any appreciable dust flying off of these boots? i'd like not to take all that dirt in there.
"you know, jim, i got a checklist on the left arm for one thing that's going on now, and a check- list on the right arm for something else that's going on now (laughter)."
"okay. what i have on the board here to perform at - i guess we'll call it c-prime - is a sample, and i guess you already got a pan - i thought some- body did - and the lpm then."
"we haven'z heard anything about sensors in the last couple of days. 05 21 37 32 i2_p l;o,maybe they gave up."
"when you get into the presleep checklist, you can delete the stir cryos, which is in the checklist. we won't stir the cryos, and then as you get further downstream closer to los here - the sleep period, we'll have you turn the h2 tank 2 fans to the on position. i'll give you a reminder on that. /"
roger. i'll be working on that in just a second here. i'll start equalizing.
"yes, mag n."
"ron, we're standing by."
"okay, ken, the umbilical thing is really - i don't see how you get any thrust out of that thruster that's pointed right at that umbilical thing. shoot, it fires right on it."
"function, enable."
do that?
yes ....
mark. __
"okay, we've already stowed most of this stuff, bruce. the tether - the 100-foot tether is already in the isa (clears throat ); the lec waste tethers can go in the tsb and so can the 30-foot tiedown webbing. the colmmander's hasselblad, we can put in the isa; the eva gloves are already in the isa."
okay. thank you.
within 30 seconds.
cdr's at 50.
that's a nice one.
anybody got any suggestions down there on how we can warm up the cabin a little bit? it's getting a little cool in here. can we go - do like we did on launch day or whatever it is and maybe run the secondary loop without any coolant on it or something? time skip
mags?
this is gene. how do you read me on alfa?
"okay. you guys ready? okay, houston; 15. the side hatch dump valve is coming open."
"well, lock it, charlie. 05 02 l? 43 lmp-eva how do you do that? by pushing down?"
"minus 1, plus 1, plus 1. okay."
... tricky; wish we had -
take it away. isn't this great? o0 00 44 23 _ isn't this marvelous? dnfide
"okay. o1 03 29 52 imp okay, tony. go ahead."
that's several large rocks there.
"roger, jim. we were hoping that in your ptc that you occasionally see the earth coming through the window; and, if that's true, then we'd like you to have to - just damp the rates with the earth in the forward window. and then we '11 give you the burn attitude via the forward window on the earth momentarily. over."
"_ - ... mandel'shtam, i took another - took another look at the craters we'd talked about. and, t_ere are two places on there where i think i see these flow scarps that i was talking about. and, one of them is at - let's call it 16b degrees east and about 2-1/2 degrees south. and, you see a little blob that the artist has drawn in there, and that looks like that is part of - of what i'm looking at - that appears to me to be a - kind of like a flow field."
"and, jim, there's a esp experiment over 240 000 miles."
"it goes further than that, charlie. the docs may have caused the panic, but somebody had to realize - someone operationally should have realized that - that no matter how panicked they were, they couldn't do any better than what they had already planned."
okay. they're migrating toward plus y.
"okay, we got them all. we're coming off with a main vent line."
stand by.
"yes, we got you. we got you. just working great."
okay. we're setting our ordeal at 100/_rth.
"we know that it was within 15 kilometers of where it was supposed to be, gene. we could not get a visual on it. it was quite obvious that the geo- phone saw it and all that - there's no question aoout that, it's just that, as it turned out at the last minute it was pretty hard to pick out where exactly it was going to be in order to have the tv camera there."
roger.
"negative, jack. we'll have to have the narrow beam width."
"okay, dave, we're going to have to sack that one up and think about moving on."
*** try.
"okay, ar.di verify i am in slew and not in auto."
"challenger, this is houston. going up to you through bermuda, and your - you should come down through goldstone. how do i sound now?"

and that - and that should be a good enough - and that should be a good station 5.
"roger. exactly. and then a note - well, let's see. the note is - just a rehash of what we've already told you. the burn should not exceed 1 second if it's possible to avoid it. and then, exit p47 immediately after burn."
"11, we have no complaints at all. we don't see that waviness on our picture. it's just really great. over."
"roger. loud and clear, charlie. time skip 421 09 06 35 23 _ and it doesn't look like it took, pete."

"that's one of the blue-gray rocks, bob. and it's got a light-colored fragment that runs the full height of it, about a meter and a half thick. and then it's got the gray or blue-gray rock on the other side. as a matter of fact - let me look at it closely. it's a fr_mment in it all right."

"okay, 3000 feet, braking down to 20."
"yes, what do you need? you mean the one from hawaii back or something like that?"
"okay. now, why don't you face the wall over there and move in as close, and i'll get the overhead valve."
"well, like he says - it seems to me what he means is that - is that the thtng's just going to deplete the helium in there."

"yes, and it's just about - it's like two-thirds of the window, if i've got my hand no more than 6 inches from it. you know, on the - on the dark side, you can see a big dark disk, and i think the reason i can see it is it's the solar corona that's illuminating around the back side. and i can see a star within - well, maybe it's within a degree of the moon's disk."
okay. you were kind of clipping there for a little bit. i got the last part of your transmission.
just a minute.
that screw you up?

"well, joe, i didn't think we had any extra inflight garments aboard, but we're going to check right now."
did we ever get a piece of glass in place?
"and i'm on secondary, or number 2 pump right now, and i'll hold here for a couple of seconds and then switch back to number 1. 04 _j 40 35 cc roger."
east massif has outcrops on it. i can see now on the north side. and they also tend to have linear upper terminations. and some of those line up as if there's roughly horizontal structure within the upper one-half of the east massif.
"i don't think we have another color mag out here, do we, joe? we'll have to use black and white - -"

there's nothing in there.
okay. next - -

"okay, jim. this is a new step completely at 60 hours. we did say something at 57:45. i'll come back to that in a minute to make sure that's straightened around. but at 60 hours, after the step in the flight plan, s-band al/x,tv to off, add two steps. and they are ""pan camera. self test to off"" and ,'mapcamera, on to off."" over. tape .$3/7"
i - i don't know.
yes. i think that's going to do it for the side. that was a tough one ...

there sure is.
okay.

okay. tlme skip
okay. that should be the water sep.
"yes. yes, we really got that one messed up."
okay. it's activated into low.
"i see you have your e_ entry check coming up. if there is any chance of my slipping in this change of procedure on contamination cloud photog- raphy i'd be pleased to - at this point. ll 05 26 42 _ okay, give us a couple of minutes to reconfigure here. we'll have time to do that."
"casper, while you're maneuvering there, would you want to copy the abort pad?"
"yeah, i see it."
"okay. and we can check back and inform you more specific on what the times were there in terms of your exercise period, also. i'd like 0mni charlie, please, there, 17. and we might mention that oscillations like this have been seen on the ground under somewhat different circ_m_tances, but oscilla- tions like this have been seen on the ground in ground tests previously. and i might say, also, that as far as other things in the spacecraft are concerned, everything looks absolutely normal or nominal, as the case may be, and in great shape and emph - i'd emphasize again that we've seen none of this oscillation again since 71 hours. over."
i'd better change mv bag.
i did the same thing.
"ron, is the smallest cell you see about ar_ eighth of an inch across? 01 22 09 27 c_cp the smaltes cell i see is a four-sided one; it looks like a diamond. and it's an eighth of an inch on one side, an eighth of an inch on the other side, and maybe 3/16 on the other two sides."

set it down just outside the shadow here. right - whoa - right there. that's good. there's still some good clean ground there. okay.
"oh, as a matter of fact, joe, we made a good thor- ough search of the lm before we let it go. we went from top to bottom to make sure we got everything, and i'm sure we got everything we brought up off the surface, and i'm pretty sure we did - did fairly well cleaning up the surface."
"okay, at 271:50, change the roll in the verb 49 attitude to 140. and the high gain is - - 09 19 53 06 cml° from lhl to lh0?"
roger. we copy. press on with the - with the - turning it on.
okay. that's sort of towards the end of 3-9.
okay. and scb 5 is one for the lmp if you want to take it off the gate.
"it might work if we had to do it, fred. right now we're looking at a comfortable excess of water through the sublimator. we were talking among ourselves this morning about having you try out the plss to ascent tank water-transfer situation and we decided not to do it, not to recommend it, because we figure it'd take us 30 hours to empty one of the ascent tanks, which you have to do in order to get plss water to it, and we'd rather use the descent water and we don't think we've gotten any sweat. over."
"roger, jack."
sklodowska.
"hey, listen, you gonna have to just take it easy; we ain't really in no hurry."
ok_f. stand by 1.
okay. and we still have the vent valve open. we'll close it one of the last things and looking at lm/cm delta-p right now and i see 0.5 in psi indicated.
looks like you can't have an eat period and see what's on the flight plan because you're gonna have ...
how about let me use the center window for a second?
"okay; copy ""35 oxidizer greater than fuel; 5 oxi- dizer less than fuel."" gl 00 34 14 cc okay. and the final part of that is in the ""tight constraints"" there in the box. it says ""greater than 160, and greater than 80."" we'd like to change that to ""greater than 168 oxidizer, and greater than 153 fuel."""
coming up on 20 seconds.
"roger, joe .... 06 03 12 40 i_4p-eva bend over a little, dave."
*** don't you just go turn the sep receiver off? ·** did that. the receiver's all done.

"okay, vance. while we're waiting, just for your information, the command module has been stowed per your checklist with the exception of the two hasselblad cameras."
did you get some pictures of it?
"yes, they're rate 2, pete."
"no, that's a good card. we don't need that up yet, though. you want to leave that up for eva and everything?"
you got it?
"yes. now, check your tape motion."
yes.
- -the gloves and helmets off.
"eagle, houston. request abort stage, reset, ... prop reset, and mode control to att hold when you get a chance to."
okay; 1 minute mark at 28:43.
"okay. i've got that much more. that's the end. you may have it tangled on something, pete."
because we - i'll have to get into it - damn - have to get into it to find out what we're looking for there.
roger.
what do i turn that to?
...
okay.
you've got it.
yeah. if we were on hot mike - -
"okay. thanks, joe."
greater than 5.
okay. you got a pro; i've got to get my heaters down ... all that stuff. they're auto.
"roger. we overlooked the fact that you are taking these photos in the midst of sim bay operation, so a couple of little things change. going back to page 3-352, you can first of all delete, below the damp rates notation, in - you can delete ""inhibit all jets,"" except the jets that are there, and just keep the jet configuration you got right now. l0 07 05 43 _ okay. i copy that. do you have any other comments?"

"okay, houston; america. had 50 percent on mag charlie charlie when i changed mags there for the landmark tracking. and let's see, frame ]_lo,i think - or ll2 - let me look on that one."
"roger. readback correct. i have two more short comments on them, but i want to wait just a second and make sure i understand them before i pass them to you. 01 04 52 25 ij_' okay."
"good morning, joe. that got everybody up. 11 22 32 55 c_ morning, j.p."

"no doubt about it, geno. l_p-lm don't be too pessimistic, joe. i think it's going to happen."
go ahead.
"roger. ron, inc0 just asked me to remind you that those high gain angles that you see in this block here are strictly if we lose lock here during the manuever. that's the reacquire angle."
"my ears have cleared up, john. i mean my sinuses."
okay. it's right in the middle.

what? i don't have - -
"it's on, charlie."

okay. i'm done.
get the what?
"roger. thank you. 04 21 44 16 cdr-i_4 what we'll do is get all hooked up to the suit, and then let you check it out, and then climb into the suit, just to make sure."
lower your foot if you can.
"okay. and, ken, getting back to that flight plan, there's only one more change that - at 167:30 - 06 21 20 10 cml° ail right - go ahead."
"the high gain is holding on there, but we think we can improve our - the time we can hold on to narrow beam width a little bit if you'd tweak it to pitch, plus 15, and yaw, plus 185, please."
"roger. 03 03 0b 22 cc apollo ll, this is houston. we observed your gimbal test down here, and it looked good to us. over."
"i like the kind of ship you run, ...... happy."
we're still accelerating.
stand by. we got it. we just had one circuit breaker out of position.
we should have gotten ... 00 02 15 lb cdr what?
"no, i didn't get that yet. do you want to let it run on through until i come out aos, or do you want - when do you want that terminated? 04 20 35 49 cml° okay. time skip 04 21 29 07 cml° okay. thirty seconds, and everything looks good here. 0k 21 29 23 cmp okay. ullage is on."
"jim, when you get finished moving your stowage around and it's convenient, we'd like to terminate the battery charge for a little while to bring up the cm tm so we can take a look at the temperatures again, like we did yesterday. advise that right now on your batteries, you have lll amp-hours; and, eventually, we hope to have them up - peaked up to about ll6. one other point, we - we can either read that procedure up again which involves cranking up the telemetry, or, if jack still has it, we can use his notes and - but i have one or two changes to - to make on them. over."
"oh, don't bump into that."
"ok_f, hank. on the first part of mine, i was - first 30 minutes, i was right side up in the leb with my head against the optics covers. and now i'm upside down in the leb with my head against the optics covers to see if that makes any difference."
- - hardware here. we wonder where scb-2 went?
i'm getting them.
"... oh, i see ..."
"which one, the eomm thing?"
hung up on something.
"no, no. we won't. we'll use the checklist straight __ through on the rest of the burns."
okay. okay. i don't know what happened to the co_.
"i'll lock it. i'll just push that latch- that latch is just sticking, that's all. it's just dust, i guess. i don't know what you do about those problems."
you'd better take all these pictures; i'm running out.
come back this way when you do. i need tha_ rammer again.

return is egress.
"well, i guess we all probably have a different idea on which would be the single most exciting moment of the flight, and maybe we'll just run through it one at a time. i guess the most impressive moment i can remember is standing up on hadley mountain - hadley delta, and looking back at the plain and seeing the lm and the rille and mount hadley, and the whole big picture in one - one swoop. and i think we've got some pictures for you from up there, and i believe the tv was running at the same time, and i think that was probably the most impressive sight that i've ever seen. al?"
that's correct. yes.
i'll get the sesc.
"okay, we've got a i_4/cm delta-p of 0.6. we'd like to go ahead and pressurize the cabin and then get ready for the lm entry."
"okay, and you, you're not going to do anything in the presleep checklist with the vhf, because we've just given you all these others, and you deleted those two steps that were in there. 06 09 22 40 c_p yes, sir."
"roger. dave, you mean to say that these small bright craters seem to be clearly related to the ejecta blanket. is that correct?"
you know what we really need is rita to fix it for us.
"just in case you were wondering what in the heck went wrong that time. and, i have a tei-37 any time you have time to copy it."
okay. stand by. i'll see if i c_n get something worked out for you.

"okay. hey, i see what you were talking about, gene, on this blister. something has really blistered on it. like quad alfa. there's a good one? okay."
go ahead.
"roger. we copy that. and if you've started it, we don't want you to reinitialize the ptc until about 2400 on the time line."
"... you, yet."
that's okay.

05:41 is the correct stop time. we just - this is just putting in words what goes along about that time.
"hank, is - are we okay with the t_tl° in valve in manual? with this setting?"
"- - 165, 060, and 338."
su:re that's exactly what you wanted ...?
"plss pump, off, and fan, off. l_p-lm okay."
"well, we ought to get a good sample at the bottom of this."
roger.
okay; let me look at something here (laughter).
"say again, ron? cml° these unit vectors of saturn, aren't they in my - planet unit vectors -yes, stars - oh, here we go."
"charlie, this is houston. how do you read now?"
roger.
okay. hand me the eyepiece. i got scorpio.
okay. onfiden .
"okay, houston. panel 276, instrumentation out and reset - -"
roger.
okay. 32021.
got the earth in the tube. okay.
"yeah, it does. okay. you want a - you want a helmet wipe? you want to - i - you want to wipe off all the little windows in the cockpit?"
okay.
"ok_ r, i got two gloves that are locked. you checked my helmet."
"okay, we copy. 07 09 17 58 _-_,! i - i tell you, this thing really flies beautifully."
"bob, you could probably see this rock if you look over this way. we're high enough."
get back over here then. is it losing it? 04 o0 47 32 imp little bit.

"okay. are they planniag on a g&n entry or using another system, like _s or something 1lke that?"
"okay. ""if glitch occurs, use rhc to stop maneu- ver. verb 23 noun 20 enter enter. verb 40 enter. verb 62 enter. manual maneuver to attitude."""
go ahead.
i'm not about to argue with them at this pcint.
"okay, jack. vhf b, full decrease. 4-4 '_' '_[_' day 4"
"okay, we don't have _lything for you. our only concern is that you'i! wake up somebody; is there anybody sleeping right now?"
okay. i'm ln reacq. want to go back to auto now?
"okay, karl. i've got all the camera setups for the solar corona. and they're all checked out and ready to go, so i'll stand by for your pad."
i'm looking out window 3.
"flood should be in, and asa in on the second one."
"okay, that's good. and i have the - the other pads if you're ready to copy them, or if you want to press on, then we'll come back and pick them up later. your choice."
"whereabouts did you find it, john?"
"i know they are. we're climbing, jack. because i've been full bore most of the time, and all i can get out of it is 10 clicks; and when i deceler- ate, she decelerates in a hurry. what's our next stop here, a sample at 3.9?"
- - these flight plan changes i've got for you coming up later will be all some items farouk has on camera pictures on the - that spot jack thought he saw the light spot and a few other changes.
goodness knows we've tried.
"gordy, this is jack. what did they see over next to the sculptured hills on the gravimeter?"
"okay, gordo. let me disable all alfa and bravo first."
"you got it? you said you did not have a tone, is that correct?"
"get this squared away. bright - coming in the window here, i can't see my dsky .... gdc - well, this could [?] be 20 going first. enter 2-2 - enter - we use option - -"
houston. roger.
"okay. can you locate that occurrence for us in time when you first noticed water in the suit, either by mission time or relation to any particular event?"
"i was saying that, houston, *** stop and take a photograph or something and then want to start moving again sideways, there's quite a tendency to start doing it with just gradual sideways hops until you start getting ***"
okay.
roger. understand.
"okay, i'll handle it. yeah. i recommend they enjoy it as much as we did. i'm sure they will, because, i tell you, we really have - we really have had a lot of sights to see. i'll admit that, in a lot of cases, we worked hard, and - and i suppose the people on the ground were able to tell that. but we got all the support in the world from the mcc-houston. i - i mean, i could tell, from every decision that came up from the ground, that - that there was a lot of work put into it. and all around the country that there were a lot of wheels 11 _ page 515 turning and people working late hours and solving these problems. and i'm just really happy that ken, charlie, and myself got to do this. and i think it's a wonderful experience."
"okay, when i terminate the emp 509, you want me to write that between rate, high and ems to normal? and it looks like the - i would do the verb 48 back to my original vslues, but it looks like i would not be resetting the average g flag. or do you want that reset anyhow?"
... that?
something's funny here.
use the 85-millimeter lens on it.
"okay, in your surface checklist, page 5-7."
"and the suit loop's going up over there, too."
okay.
"casper, houston. go ahead."
c_n't hold everything still to get the thing in there. _ bag go in there? got it all stowed?
"okay, don. we're ready for a dump."
"that's it. plss 02, off. can you verify that i've got mine off?"
"we're sending you a state vector, a target load, and a refsmmat."
"()kay. wells you're at 4000 feet now at 5 feet a second, ken."
"we're seeing apparently some biases in the p - in the rcs sensors up there. stand by - wait 1. wa'ii get you some readings, ken."
"cabin pressure relief, close at 800 feet. l0 04 35 29 cml° ... 800 feet_ we're at l0 right now; l0 04 35 33 r recovery i has visual."
that's what i'm doing at the moment.
yes - lower left they - they go obliquely up the slope.
okay; cover is closed.
"bob, i - i think i don't have too much to add to what i said, near the end of the eva, is that i do not have an intuitive feeling that the regolith has been derived from most of the boulders that we're seeing. but - because those boulders are fairly light-colored, they look like they're probably 50 percent plagioclase. the - it could be that the regollth is derived from some other material that has blanketed the area. i don't think we have that answer, yet."
okay. ·// 04 12 16 30 cml° and i'll go see if i can get papa papa out here real fast.
yeah.
"okay, now. stand by a minute, joe."
i can't feel any difference between 1/6g and any- thing else right now.
"everything's in great shape up here, you guys."
roger.
"good show. tapa, 97/'_6"
"well, we got a little bit off jack. the - it starts high in the lmp's window and goes low in the cdr window. oh 10 5] 37 cmp so we've got a little b_t of a wobble on it. of course, the command nodule venting doesn't help, either."
"just hold off on it 1, jim. we'd like to take a look at it."
"houston, endeavour. if you're copying the dsky, the gyro torque angles are up."
"oh, okay."
"orion, will you go normal voice?"
i think ...
roger.
roger.
fire.
or words to that effect.
oh.
"okay, yes, let's write it down there in the - why don't you write it on the back page, or something like that, so we'll know where it is."
"okay. i copy that. cdr-iai bob, the boulders - the boulders we are sampling - i thi_ jack and i both feel that it's probably - we feel we sampled the subfloor because we saw on the sides of the craters where some of these boulders were exposed _lmost as if they were bedrock down there. in driving back from what we called station l, we - we could definitely see the light mantle out in the area where the potentials of a slide are."
"... 09 03 26 59 _ you've been out about 25 minutes now, ken."
yes.
"... copy noun 60, noun 43. over. (tranq)"
"that's the whole idea of the thing, ron."
that's a low metabolic load.
"okay. yeah, that's enough. okay, i'm going to intercom/ptt."
"okay, we got everything - we're yaw at zero."
"okay, that's what did it."
"okay, jack. we want to put the primary and the secondary evaporated water control valves to auto. q5 g6 24 37 cmp okay."
"okay, stand by on - pitch and roll."
that's correct.
i'll tell you the guy that could really milk this son of a bitch was john young. i think that's all he did was figure out every thrust before he went_ 03 19 15 49 i24p ... matter with dick gordon ...
yes.
okay. fine.
it doesn't work. b is better than that. there's omni a; how's that?
it was a lot slower than i thought it would be.

"well, but ... it's part of these fragments around here. i guess turning point rock is l, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, - 6 meters high anyway. it's a - well, i'd say it's a very rough subrounded type of rock - by the face - let me get this, jack. okay. there are two fragments in that sample."
"yes, which way do we want to go around? i'll tell you -"
okay.
"roger. and, on the insulation and foils, i guess there's a question here - were any of them burned or discolored? you probably already told us that. were any of them torn, or were there any attach- ment failures?"
"you can go recorder, off, now, ron."
"roger. and if the rover's fairly level, we'll give you a nav update - later on."
"apollo 11, houston. could you give us a few com- ments on your crew comfort with the csm hoses moving the air around? over."
"john, ... 08 08 34 4_ cdr here. :take the pictures, charlie."
okay. we'll give you a little more report when we get a little closer to it.
"yeah. mine are the same way, and i cut mine. i don't think it has anything to do with that."
which one? l_-eva make sure that's locked on there.
"okay. at 1 minute, ""master arm,"" we scratch. at 35 seconds, scratch the first two lines. ""manual ullage"" will start at 9 seconds; we're scratching the blocks at 02 seconds; and the line beneath that, at plus 1 second, we ""terminate ullage."""
"... mauy minutes. verb 32 enter. okay, houston. we're verb 32, and we ought to have pretty good n_mbers."
i'll be quiet - -
"houston, apollo 13. i'm about ready for any flight plan updates that you have."
"dave, this is houston. jim's feedwater pressure's a little high. we wonder if you can - are in a position to - to see water coming from his sub- limat or? over."
"and, john, verify you got the mesa."
the alignment is way over here. let me - -
"okay, joe. let me review the - -"
and mine are locked. confidenti/iil
"17, houston. the evasive burn is complete, and the lox dump will be at 5 plus 24 plus 20."
that's locked.

"gee, i wish i didn't ..."
yes.
"you're clear. il8 _:_, 3 !, '"
"okay. good night, stu. yes, sir. thank you very much. you've been a big help."
okay. my - the cross is one-half bar width - -

"okay. we got a hack on it, ron. if you started it, we started our clock."
"okay, understand. ail right. in the ""flight plan update"" section, on the four emp programs, we'd like you to add a fourth - correction, a final termination procedure to each of the four programs. so on the ""shortened p23,"" we'd have a step k, which reads ""verb 25 noun 26 f_nter,"" and then the ""four registers, enter all balls"" - correction, ""three registers, enter all balls."""
oh ....
okay. understand you have opened the drain valve at this time.
"yeah, i got you."
all right.
"okay, but you probably ought to yaw about 45 de- grees now anyway."

"okay, as far as you can tell, so that we can look at it over night, the rear fender - the part that's remaining - looks in fairly good shape, right?"
okay.
"negative. we still need the computer, ron."
"*** we're there, and we are."
huh?
"we have gathered the materials, and i can put jack on the headset and he can copy the instruc- tions ... do you see any need for - or should i copy it to give them to him, or do you th_nk they're too detailed?"
there's a b_nch° why don't you open it?
"houston, apollo 11. the next time we pass through roll 0, we're going to stop ptc and that will give us 90 degrees pitch. now, i understand you want us to move from 90 degrees pitch to 0 degrees pitch for the platform align, option 1. is that affirmative?"
"yeah, i - i've got second thoughts, right now, as to whether or not that was luck or skill. i thought it was being pretty skillful because i could see all the way to the - i could see all the way to the ground and then we got out - and i noticed that we were kind of close to a crater, so i went forward a little. then we got out and, shoot, we hadn't landed more than about 10 feet beyond this big thing."
okay; right there.

"okay, gene. can you look at the capture latches? i've got it preloaded here, now."
"well, let's see, just kind of fouled that one up. really wanted 142, narrow dead band, don't you, at 142, 269, and 0 - and 359? thought we were already in that attitude."
where's turtle mountain. right here?
go _ead.

go ahead.

"mark. gravity .... okay; now let me get to work. - okay .... my fender got a little kinked here, which isn't going to help us ... f cc hey, jack. and we see your gold visor is up. you may want to put it down out here in the sun."
yes. looks good.

stand by. we'll get with the goldstone tv guy. we don't have anything here at houston. stand by.
"okay. that does it for now, ken."

"wild, isn't it? f"
coming up on apollonius. that area now is that correct?
"*** jack. that's really fighting it pretty hard. we'd like you to put the uht in the socket and rock it very firmly. don't pick it up, but rock it very firmly from side to side in all four di- rections about - move your uht about 6 inches in each direction while you're doing it. 06 23 27 34 l_p-eva okay. okay; i rocked it. *** swinging. and the level bubble is - -"
"hey, houston; america. we can take those words on the weather in the recovery area, if you like."
"why don't you just leave it there if it's centered with the level bubble within the inner - within the inner circle there. that's the requirements as far as we can tell, and we'll just have to leave it overnight again. and why don't you come on back to the lm."
"are you maneuvering, ken?"
"that's right, jack."
"*** got the lock on it. okay, now. bob, say again which reg a you want left."
"hello, tlouston; aquarius."

"roger. read you 5 by 5, and we've just got one final thing to do and that should sew it down for the evening. just wanted to double check that you've got your suit hose connectors red to red, blue to blue. 05 10 41 08 l_p-_m deke, we're just going to get them. we've been drying out the suits. we're going to configure the ecs for sleep momentarily."
i don't know whether i said it or not - -
"there you go, good show."
"yes_ we could tell that, jack. great job."
"there's a very interesting little fissure just below us here, bob. it looks like there might be a little flow coming out of it, but it's - it's almost an arrowhead-shaped affair. and, it cer- tainly doesn't have any features like any - any impact. it's very sharp and distinct and makes a very distinct arrowhead. and here we come up on the ridges on the west side of serenitatis, just at the foothills of the hadley apennines. and you can see, there is - there is some relief as we look back to the south there, there is some very distinct relief in - in - in the shore of serenitatis, with some wrinkle ridges that follow the contour. and some - what look like fairly distinct arcuate rilles that also follow the con- tour. i think that when we get up very close here, you can see - in - in the field of view there right now, is a lineament that looks like it might be some sort of a collapsed lava tube, and you can also see down in here the - the mare material looks like it's pooling in the - in the foothills of the mountains; and in some places, you can even see what appears to be a frozen shoreline, so to speak."
"yes, i'll get them. i want to do a little bit better documentation on this thing - bob -"
"that's right, the heat flow probe."
understand. no circ.
"roger. we're watching that middle gimbal. we have as a roll, 27172. our yaw is - that's register 3 - 3300. how did we get this?"

roger. we copy.
"you want that buffer in there tonight, don't you? 02 10 55 19 cml° i don't know. it's a - i - i can't vouch for how much chlorine went in. perhaps - very little. it's up to the - the guys who have plumbing re- sponsibilities. i - i just can't tell you how much chlorine may have gotten in."
"*** other one, is it? no."

"okay, houston; endeavour. we're maneuvering. go ahead with the rest of the pad."
okay. we copy that.

okay. you're not having to worry about the photos yet?
and the guard is down.
"okay. we're observing middle gimbal angle getting a little bit high. the lm appears to be deadbcund- ing okay within its attitude_ but just wanted you to know that we're keeping an eye on it and if it does get too high, we might want you to punch off early. 05 21 ]5 32 cmp okay."
okay.

go ahead. over.
"roger, dave. as luck would have it, we lost our comm just as we got the delta-p number from you. we copied 1.9. verify that for us, please. and, also, would you make sure that the valve is still in the vent position."
i'm glad to hear it was fit to print.
"yeah, medium on the high gain."
"okay, 15. we got it now. couple of big holes in the ground out there."
empty.
"you want to turn your numerics up, so you can see them a little better?"

"houston, we're trying to get oriented here so we can perhaps pick out some of the features near the landing site. there's quite a bit of shadow now, but we have aristillus and autolycus very clearly. and with a low sun angle, the surface between those two large craters and the rim of imbrium - the eastern rim of imbrium is very rough, quite a bit of debris, and it looks like it probably came out of the two craters. i be- lieve we can see hadley c, just barely on the shadows. 03 07 3b 21 cc roger, 15. we copy that. did i understand that the rim of autolycus is standing up in the sunlight? ob 07 33 31 cdr yes, that's true. aristlllus and autolyeus both have their eastern rims exposed to the sunlight, and we get a pretty good look at the elevation on the rim. and autolycus, to its northeastern side, seems to have a - a saddle or somewhat depressed rim, and as you come around to the west - the eastern side of aristillus, it seems to be rela- tively level or horizontal, with a few subtle saddles and depressions. autolycus appears to have a - a relatively horizontal or - or even rim all the way around, and we can see sunlight on the northwestern side of autolycus on the rim, just barely a tick of it."
we'll use the seat.
okay. it should come straight out of the _sa. ail you can do is jiggle and pull.
"from left to right. %hat's affirmative. ,; 04 13 02 32 cc of course, the only other thing that we'd be concerned about is what change in your velocity this might have had and what delta-v it imparted, and we'll have to look at that for a while before we are able to determine it. and, if there is no significant change, why, we prefer just to leave it the way it is."
okay. we copy.
"- - we're trying to be subtle there, guys."
here's number 2.
okay. 08 23 5_ 51 lmp steam press pegged; 90k.
... - -
"roger, jack. say, you might want to put something in the back of your mind here a minute. we made a run of the dse recording just now of the tli to get an idea of the quality of the dse recording, and gene came through loud and clear. ron was very weak and almost unreadable, and we never caught you, jack, in there. we don't - maybe you weren't saying anything during tli, but we never did catch anything you said."
that's verified.
"15, this is houston. how do you read?"
roger. that's correct.
smells kind of funny in there. what'd you guys do? (laughter)
"hozuston, aquarius."
okay.
okay.
"- - and rear to d, and rear to d. drive power forward is going to a. i didn't feel any earth- shaking rumbles like i do in the - in the trainer, but let's see what happens."
"man, will it ever."
"yes, indeed, you made a lot of people in the back room very happy. they're looking forward to getting that film."
"okay. the surgeons are, first of all, request that ron press on his sensors. they're looking like they're getting loose according to the data here. they also reco - recommend for ron that if he's still using the nose drops - i guess he has been - they recommend that he take one decon- gestant pill before going to sleep and one after breakfast in the morning. it's a suggestion. it's his option. the thought being it might help in clearing your ears during that final descent. you may leave the optics power on for more heat in the cabin if you wish. we'd like you to stop charge in battery b. over."
okay.
okay. we'll just leave her go.
"okay, here come the gimbal motors. ready, al, pitch 1."
"ttouston, 13. 05 03 56 115 cc go ahead, jack. ()5 0_ 56 ;19 cmf ()kay. we're still in {_ood shape as far as water goes in the lm? _)5 (_3 541 5(i cc ()kay. we copy.

we have inboard cut-off.
i don't know whether we do or not. let's take a look at it.
"i guess they're all there, aren't they? l_-eva i think they are. there are three clasts, anyway - or three fragments that we got off."
yes. plus ... right ....
okay.
"friendly hu - houston, anything else before i hop in?"
"15, houston."
pull it off.
engine arm is off.
"okay, guys. we're going to follow an apollo 16 mode and put stuff in loose, because they'd like to segregate stuff in the following way. like to put the long can and four core tubes in the src. i guess it's going to take a long - going to take a while just carrying stuff back and forth. but they'd probably like to get this in, because it's a volatile stuff. they'd like to get the long can and three core tubes in the src n_nber 1. and then we'd like to get all the scb-_ samples in the same src. over."
okay.
"pressure flag, and i still got an 02 flag."
"it's okay. okay, it's 3 minutes into the burn. we're coming up on tight rules very shortly."
- - and the receive power switch is on.
"yes, let's put the sesc someplace - -"
"okay, i go to bus charlie and the circuit breaker is cycled. no forward steering, joe."
okay.
"okay, what's the heading down survey ridge, where i think we are right now, charlie?"
roger. we just had a really big thu_derstozrm here about a hour age. couple of storms around the area ... over.
okay; thanks a lot.
okay. now. 144:38 - -
i've got a star in the - -
verify the filter down on .05g. 11 o1 23 59 cml° that's verified.
good.
okay.
and your logic power b closed? :' ial 5 _ 1-23
"here are the gimbal angles. command module, 356.69, 163.42, 346.67. aquarius is 302.26, 345.92, 011.79. over."
"okay, we're operate. barber pole and a gray."
"and, apollo 15, you're 5 minutes from los, look- ing good, and go for the burn for doi trim."
you'll have to turn the optics power on before you're going to get anything.
all right ....
got it.
okay. are we in this card here?
"well, i don't see what's back here that's not battened down .... up here; ... over there."
"okay, will do."
well - *** doing?
what was thepitch? but that makes sense because we're ... in pitch.
"roger. john and charlie are at north ray now, and, boy, is that a big hole."
"bob, as long as we're talking about consumables, what are you showing down there for water? because we are reading - oh, about 60 percent on descent 1 and 2 now."
"they're between tacquet and mel-mel-melanes [sic], aren't they? yes. i see them ... okay. yes, little bitty ones. they're about - oh, a little bit bigger than shorty. yes. those are - those are the ones that i called the other day. it was a very, very light tan. i guess you can put aa orange tint to them. i_mp gordy, to put orange into perspective, a_ leas_ as far as the lmps eyes are concerned - from orbit, i would say that it's a orange-gray. zv's still a gray, with an orange hue to i_. _md _._.en i use any blue or tan or ar_yvhing, i-o'sa hue os. gray; and -'ii usually try _o say g__a_,ir::zkere. bu:cto sa_r something's orar.ge, i thir_k_ would be misleading, it's really arkorar,ge-gra_r_ buz i%_s clearly a diszinct hue."
"okay, _ke, what happened is- you know, you were sitting there monitoring verb 16, noun 20, and at step 7 you went into verb 24, noun 01, and keyed in the address and then information information; and on the final enter of that 35400 enter, right after that, it - that then put you back into the 16, noun 20. then when you did the verb 24, enter, you were really entering the information in the actual cdu; and when you got the two entries in, in register i and 2, it was an - at was an instan- taneous change in the actual cdu, and the cm dap looked at that and saw - saw what at thought it (goss net 1) tape 102/4 had. my - my gosh, i got a 600-degree-per-second rate. and it turns on the jets to try to take that rate out. and the rate filters that it's looking at - it - well, the rate it's looking at is filtered, so it doesn't really sense the actual rate until the thing is already built up, and then it starts reading the rate filters, and it says, ""well, i really didn't have 600 degrees."" so then it turns it off and tries to slow it down. but until that happens, and it is some time lag, and that's why the rate was building up. the jets were on, and they were going to stay on due to that instantaneous 600 - suspected 600-degree-per-second rate. over."
"okay, jack. let's take bmag i off."
"hell, yes. 03 15 31 26 cml° how about the backside sand? go play in the sand on the back side."
"okay, this ought to give the folks back home some- thing to look at right here. okay, we're at our first stop. okay. power this beauty down."
roger. maybe you better watch your step.
"okay, fred-o. we don't plan to use the steerable antenna, although we want to leave the heaters on. so it looks you ought to open up comm s-band antenna, but leave s-band antenna heaters closed. 02 12 48 33 _ roger. comm s-band is open, s-band heater breaker is still closed."
we got it right here.
yes. i thought that po0 and data might get you in trouble. okay; how's that?
what did you say?
"i am not sure, vance."
"anything over there, jim?"
eighty degrees' bank angle. running around 3g's.
"that's affirmative. vega and altair should be good. vega is 36, altair is 40."
"okay, 670 155 201; 670 155 201."
you're loud and clear.
roger. houston - -
right. you're gonna be docking with - you're just slowly drifting to the north. you got the vertical line-of-sight rate killed.
okay - that's - you're first.
"get new - new sample collection bags for us, jim?"
"well, there's some very, very smooth places in the floor out here."
"yes. 07 04 57 30 c_r the pgns says 2 and a half forward, and - and 1 right. that sort of agrees. 07 04 57 38 i2s_l okay, ags z[sright between the two. minus 4.1. 07 0_ 57 47 cdr okay. i think - yes. think we'll just stick with the pgns. 'fnat's good enough. we're in the ball park. you're saying forward. everybody's saying forward."
"okay, we're eating."
"roger. we sure will, charlie."
okay.
"okay. 202. ¥_at do we want? 04 12 _9 54 cdr verb 21, enter. we want a 12 - oops. clear. 212, enter; a pro. and are you ready for an auto maneuver? oh 12 50 12 lmp which star are we going to?"
about l0 minutes on the waste water. okay.
"apollo ll, houston. we got a recommendation for you on your stowage of theevva's. over."
"okay, thank you. that's a couple of quick answers; appreciate it. that - that will help us in our planning. _-_ 09 09 47 17 cc okay, that is only a preliminary estimate on that midcourse 5 though."
mark cmp.
(laughter) that's right.
"aquarius, houston. ow_r."
"you can just read it off your cuff, man."
"in fact_ dr_ _ra!_z_ here: just decided that you guys get another half hour _n the morning if you wanted it. b_t you better tell us now because we'll wake you up at 56 and ask you if you want the other half hour then, _u01ess you tell us."
"casper, this is houston. how do you read?"
"okay, jack. how about the flag right over here in this little mound?"
yeah.
"that son of a bitch has gone all over the sky. it shot way past 291, the other direction."
it's still looking good. we're just standing by here - -
yes.
"mark it. got it. yaw 2. 01 tl 26 13 cmp mark it. got it? okay, got the trim, about a plus 12 and a minus 0.1. tvc, tvc, tvc, tvc. 01 il 26 29 cmp okay, give it to the computer. returns to zero. go tvc tvc. okay."
right.
okay.
"we're sort of around 27:30 in the checklist, more or less, and you want the power amp and tm to high?"
"okay, the next cae is target number 7, al. it's the bright one."
yep. okay.
"okay. i'm going over and kick off on the strut here. boy, that shadow is getting short."
okay. now are we sure that this ptc mode is good enough so we don't ... get crossed up later and get out of configuration.
where's the third core tube?
"all right, jay. yes, i - no, as a matter of fact, at one time i looked in there and saw the sextant was really blurred and i thought, ""oh, here we go. just what you'd said."" and i got to looking around, and i found that these eyepieces vibrate on there quite badly. and i guess i shouldn't use the word vibrate, then, but they unscrew, and i've got a lot of tape wrapped around them now to keep them on. and they change focus. and i had to refocus the thing. and once i got it focused, it's - if i turn the reticle lights up to full intensity, why, i get a little bit of a smear. but not much at all, and when i look at the images on the ground like in the _tracking - i took a look during the practice tracking period - and, boy, i tell you, that was just as nice. the only problem was, when you're down low and looking through that 28th power, your field of view is so small you wouldn't recognize your own house if you flew over it."
"yeah. in an area that that wasn't - that that didn't go in, right?"
33 -
you really sit high.
"okay. two on 5. 196 confidentia day s 04 16 47 08 c_ okay. the 8:20 _ent just as advertised; 2>0, i0, and 5. so far, the only thing extra was the - one on the - first one. 04 16 47 50 gmp 16, 8, and 4 on ll:l0,"
"okay, jim, i'll give you the comm. 04 15 h7 40 cc aquarius, there's no great big rush. if you want to let fred come up to speed slowly, why maybe that'll help out."
"okay, fine."
i can't.
locke. yes; right between them.
"should i watch the thrusters? and if the limit is 30 seconds, if it's a two-jet burn, we'll have - after 30 seconds, we pitch 180 and - -"
got your vhf beacon on? 12 07 l0 2h cmp 3000 - -
"question number ll, again for al. you said, after your spacewalk, you wish you'd stayed out longer. what was it like out there between the earth and the moon, and why did you come in so soon?"
"yes, it's pretty easy to break up; it's really not very coherent at all. i24p-eva you know, i thought last night, bob, that i should use the word aplitic for a texture that we saw in that inclusion yesterday on the south massif."
"hank, i'd also like to verify that it's okay to leave the csm-to-lm umbilicals hooked up in the tunnel."
okay.
roger.
"okay, mine are verified. 04 23 29 i9 cdr okay. don ev gloves."
i wonder what that - guess we're out of power. (grunt) dumb thing.
"no, a little bit more than that."
...
"okay, i've got 59 and 30. how's that? okay?"
"hey, that's a lot better, joe. i thought we'd lost you there for a minute. _"
"jack, we think you've got the steerable up as good as it's going to get. i think you're right."
roger. that's on.
"okay, the - the electrolyte pads may be still ex- panding a little bit so i'm going off the air briefly to start getting into the suit. and i'll talk to you in a little while."
i already got it.
"okay. this is going to be for one last vent on the dps tank there, so at the top of the page just after eps inverter 1, close, add - okay, after eps inverter 1, close, add prop descent helium reg/vent close, and then after stabili- zation/control aeld, close, add prop displays/ engine 0verride/logic, close. over."
"okay, those are really getting dusty. i'll hit those with a dust brush next time around."
"okay. we'd like to brief you on what our plan is. we're, at this time, water critical in the lm. so we'd like to use as little as possible. to do this, we're going to plan to make a free- return maneuver of 16 feet per second at 61 hours, which is 37 minutes from now. then we're going to power down the pgns, and then we'll - at 79 hours, we'll go ahead and make another abort maneuver to kick what we got. but we'd like to get that pgns powered down as soon as possible. that would be after the midcourse and - so how do you feel about making a 16-foot-per-second burn in 37 minutes?"
"okay. on shorty, i still have the - that light orangish-tan-type material - it's essentially perpendicularto the line of the slide area there in the northern s_micircle of the thing. i see f-crater. boy, i can't hold these crazy glasses still enough."
"good morning, charlie; it's nice to hear your voice."
...
are you through with the 500?
that one just didn't want to work any more.
"that sounds good to us, jim and dave. i think maybe you could put another section on that."
okay. they're coming off.
"yes, i know it. shit, that pissed me off! i talked about it before. wait a minute, let me - hold it right there. can you get this stuff out of there you need?"
"yeah, we sure do. how abomt rolling that one over?"
go ahead.
okay.
i'll get 16 noun 20 ut.
spacecraft control to cmc. yes.
"pete, we show that you're 3 plus 38 into the eva, and you've got a fair amount of consumables; so don't - don't rush too hard getting back in - just do what you have to, and do it at a safe pace."
okay.
that's a beauty.
"we copy, dave."
"roger. and down a little further where it says ""55 and 5,"" we want to change that to ""41 and minus 19."" 02 19 48 21 cml° okay. we've changed ""55"" to ""41"" and ""minus 5"" to ""minus 19."""
"ah, got the cap on the can."
huh! roger. understand. go for the aps tpi. thank you.
"okay, charlie. we'd like magazine foxtrot on your camera."
that can go in one of the z-bags.
okay; i'll just leave the dump valve in open. okay.
god speed the crew of apollo 17. lmp-i_m who signed it? i forgot to read it.
okay. copy that.
absolutely spectacular!
"it had 46.5, dick."
okay.
"that will be fine, dave. we'll be standing by for your call on that, and there's no hurry."
off to the left and ahead - aro_ad that little crater. they're all from this same area.
"aot - cl, angle, all zeros. that's done."
tell us when.
okay.
"apollo 11, this is houston. over."
"well, you got any familiar answers?"
"okay, dave. we've got the data. and we're working on the picture."
"so, when you're ready to copy some of those things, that's - might be a good thing to get started on. go ahead and finish squaring away your cockpit. and, while they're putting together an official summary, i can tell you my unofficial summary of eva-3 is that that sure is super. you've got to wavch those tapes when you get do_n. that's really a - that's really a spectacular place, as you can probably see. and they found a lot of mighty interesting rocks there. jack, being a true geologist, is making up new geological terms as he goes along."
"charlje, i just barely read you on the _'or-,.'ar3omnl"
okay.
"- - disable quads c and d. roger. 02 07 1_ 56 cc okay, 13. we've got fred-o on tv."
"translational hand controller, armed."
wait a minute. start over again on that.
"yes, except i noticed with the slight slope we're standing on, i keep falling in the back."
"okay. and we've got about 20 minutes before los, so there's no hurry on those pads. i've got them standing by when you're ready, and didn't know what you - what you had in mind about working on these things. we might get - you might get started on the hatch integrity check, if you get to that point, and i can give you the pads while you're waiting for it to bleed down or whatever it turns out to be convenient."
there' s more badges (laughter).
"yes, fortunately. i still got them. i even got them tied down this time."
"don, this thing was made for about a size 6-1/4 or something head. it's really tight on me."
"i can't - forget it. i thought i saw something. 05 1_ 39 08 cdr i'm beginning to think that these rocks that look red to us, if we'd just crack them open, we'd find they're plain old basalt rock on the inside. we just don't ever have any cracked. we ought to pound one of those things with a hammer in a minute."
"i tell you, i fell asleep with my hand on the inte- gral lighting the other day, and i - and it - and i woke up still holding on to it. funniest thing i ever did in my life. boy, that tape recorder switch's just going like crazy."
roger; we're - we're copying loud and clear.
"okay, tv's coming off to go to the tripod."
okay.
"that's negative, clipper. 04 12 28 52 c_5° okay. i'll secure it."
yeah.
thank you. i was going to ask you for that. it's really not quite the same as if you had scs only because you got the information there what's the right thing; but it sure helped to - be a lot cheaper about your rcs.
"go ahead, challenger."
"i think, with a little experience in this business, you might have picked those two out of that mass. but it's not _m_ediately obvious."
"yeah. hey, tony, it seems to me this is a - a more subdued surface over here than going towards south ray. not as many craters. it's almost - except for three or four meter-sized craters, it's all s_bdued and just hummocky and rolling."
"no. i don't think i'm going to fiddle with that right now, jack. they're not in my way."
yes.
"houston, aquarius."
"you know what, bob?"
wait a minute. do you - you fight roll by using the ttca left right. that's what you need to play with.
it's got to head away from - central station - away from everything. probably ought to point right over there.
copy. 90 both.
it's a 1202. (eagle ) o6 38 32 12o2. (eagle)
"endeavour, give us six clicks on the gamma ray gain switch, please."
mark.
"charlie, can you verify the tv pole's aligned?"
"roger. pick you up at 01:17:24. 00 00 58 2_ imp roger. sto (r w 1/2) 00 o1 17 25 imp hello, earthlings. we're back with you."
"yeah, we're on the back side, aren't we, ken? 08 o0 06 14 cml° yes, sir. 08 00 06 15 i24p okay."
"and at 95:30, we're going to start - we're going to move the activities that start around 95:47 to 95:55. so it will be moved up to 95:30."
very good.
"hello, 17. hello, 17. how do you read us this morning?"
"boy, you're not kidding. 05 09 26 -- begin lunar rev 28"
okay.
"odyssey, houston. over."
"no, couldn't be."
"five minutes, 278."
"... i don't understand. yeah, that'll be all right."
"houston, 15. we've finished the photos, and a1 had the moon in the reflex part of the nikon all the way, so i'm sure the pointing was okay."
"i don't think you can make it work, man. there's a lot of trash in here."
"roger. no, we're not going to trim those ..."
"ken, we'd like to see the turnoff of the sim bay that's on 3-6 before you turn our data off."
"... that down there's got ..., that's got to be volcanic."
"let's see, we probably ought to put that sesc in your bag."
"hello there, falcon. this is endeavour."
"12, houston. you're right smack dab on the tra- jectory; your iu's doing a beautiful job."
"and, 17, you might be - -"
"that's good news, bob. let me give you another one here. while it's ... i'll tell you i'm in to the bottom of the white marks, and that's - oh, about bravo i again."
"i guess they don't. okay, ....."
roger; 1/8th.
"copy that. and don't forget the scissors, guys."
sure.
it sure does.
endeavour copies.
okay.
"jack, you might worry about whether your camera lens is dirty or clean, jack. i don't know what you could do about it."
"that's an edge of a crater, i guess."
"okay. and on coll_mu delta, line 05, we will change that number from ""01571"" to ""01605."" over."
"oh yeah, i see it, it's taller than a - there it is. right there. see it? ? i"
"okay, we're standing by."
"okay, and don't move the high gain. the hi©n gain has been taken care of already. c_ ckay, i'll do that. lunar sounder is verified in standby. data system is coming on. high gain [_ already working. sm/ac _ower. jack, could you turn on the service module ac? i'll get it. yes. okay. service module ac power's on. lunar going to standby - -"
"okay, jack. i'm going to turn these lights off."
1.2. okay. we'll try to get block and soil.
"stand by. and in the meantime, have you put tape over the canisters that are filled with water there? and if so, we're a little worried down here that you may have taped it so well that it's making an airtight seal now, could you comment on that? 05 20 39 08 lmp-in we put the locks back on, joe."
don't walk over them._
"and, ron, just a reminder, we will bring in that voice from the - the rev 27 backside pass."
...
"roger, houston. i've been in delta the whole (columbia) time but it doesn't ..."
... 03 13 51 54 lm? i can't see anything but stars.
"okay, the hammer's on. rammer's on. 06 19 52 52 iaip-eva are the caps?"
none so we can tell. we'll get another reading here when we see it on the ground here.
"oh, i got one partial pan of abou_ three-quarters of the way up of the entire wall, and then two ray - two vertical - almost two vertical rays - -"
and the lmp's on 120.
"well, i hate to tell you this, but it won't - it's just not long enough."
"okay; very well. by the way, how are the biomed harnesses working out for the surgeons?"
"oh, yes."
"question number 13 for each of you. would you, please, in your own words, tell us what you gave the american taxpayers besides a few hours of good television?"

i'm not sure. coming through 7.
"gentlemen, we'd like to continue the press confer- ence in a few minutes. but, in the meantime, we'd be anxious to get - start - get one of you started on the lunar-eclipse photos."
"you can't tell the degree on fdai down here anyway. i mean, there's that n_ch dispersion in the instru- mentation. you know that. idiots."
roger. be advised we'll be monitoring your maneuver here in case you get in your gimbal lock. and the high gain angles in case you lose antenna lock in _-_ the new attitude will be pitch of minus 45 and yaw of 024. over.
yes. beautiful. going to make it nice to see in.
"hellc, houston; apollo 14. how do you read?"
it sure is.
okay.
okay - -
okay (laughter).
we're reading you loud and clear.
"that's real good, john. we'll hold it right there."
remember when we went out there?
okay; closed.
"yes. i guess he was a real - he lead kind of a tough life, didn't he?"
okay.
wait a minute.
"we got two core tubes and solar wind anl about (tranq) half of the big sample bag full of assorted rocks which i picked up hurriedly from around the area. i tried to get as many representative t_rpes as i could. ((;();;;; ni':'i' i 'i'apt7]4/5 l"";l,_·';,t427"
keep talking.
"15, this is houston."
"how's the bulk sample coming, nell?"
what happened there?
"okay. new cow,,attitude: 165, 060, 338."
"it was just mind boggling, as freddo says here."
"okay, set target number one. azimuth 14 and eleva- tion 48, and say again what you want me to make it, tony."
...?
roger. we're not going there yet. i'll tell you when.
"hey, gene and ron, this is the csm capcom. thought you might be interested. your buddy up on - above you there is chugging on and about ready to bed down himself, right now. and he did take a good look at the landing site through binoculars tonight and took a good look at shorty crater there, and noticed quite a lot of variations in color. that may be the same color changes you saw in that orange soil and that, but we're trying to match it up. and farouk and ron are working it out. we're trying to match it all up and see if we can get a comparison there."
"and it looks zero now, dave?"
fire.
bowen - bowen isn't much of a crater on the map.
"there are similar things - i tell you what it looks like. if anybody'd walked up the rim of kilauea iki in the ash out there, and on top of the ash, there are bombs that were fairly clearly molten when they hit, and they had just - just enough spring to break when they hit. but they - the individual pieces didn't move very far as ail. and you can see that pattern on kiiauea iki. and it was the same kind of thing, except that there was no directional aspect of it here."
roger. -- cmp-eva am i on the tube?
that sounds like a good burn. roger. we'll do that.
"okay, i'm keying."
"very good. yes, i hope this one works."
"okay; and, jack and gene, the score is l0 to &0 at the half."
"okay, do another one."
"okay, pan is complete. okay, we need the surface samplers - samples. and that go - starts with the beta and then the velvet and then a skim and a scoop."
"boy, do i sink in. wow!"
"that's affirmative. we have two of them, falcon. 04 06 59 33 cdr-i_ roger. torque to 30."
see how my pulse is doing.
is that all?
"eagle, houston. we got the biomed on the commander now. over."
i think there will be enough light in the cockpit because it'll be daylight.
"okay, you can go ahead and torque them."
"you know, lots of times when those things happen, it depends on - you can just be in a certain atti- tude and it'll happen - - l0 00 40 55 cml° yeah, yeah, yeah. sorry - sorry you got to isolate that to a bit when it's - -"

don't hit the fillets until i photograph it.
"okay. we dropped up-link, it looked like, for a while. signal strength went to zero on all antennas, and i had a command reset, and we're omni alfa, if that's okay."
"who's this, who's this, who's this?"
"okay. we're moving on down the hill, now. okay. can you see weird from here? 05 13 45 39 lmi° no."
"they called us from the control center a little while - well, before v'eleft the surface, and said now, on the docking - on the normal docking, the first attempt, they want us to thrust plus-m with you anyway."
copy that.
"roger, challenger - -"
we're just standing by for your comments you wanted to make. i think we lost comm there a minute. we're back with you.
"let's do this .... seems to be level - oh, good. thank you. _at i want to do is get the sun shadow in there. and you had it for a minute. no. til_ it a little more this way. oh 20 16 20 lmp okay. just hcld it right there."

roger. copy. sounds very good. thank you. (tranq)
"oh, yes. that's not bad. not a bad picture. 0ops!"
okay. go ahead.
here it is.
"okay. well, we've got high bit rate data on all this. they can take a look."
i don't think i could have run that mile in that ·suit ...
"and if you have any other goodies you think we ought to check over, might as well do it this evening."
"with the exception of the verb 49 maneuver, the other pages are complete."
which direction? that bright one there?
"twelve days from now, you won't believe it."
"casper, houston. you're cleared for pan camera power, off. the lens is tucked."
roger.
we'll veer over that - -

"okay, bob. i think i'll hit the hay. how does everything look to you?"
"you ought to really smoke this baby over from one end to the other, when we get - the food's no problem, but anything else is, you know, get rid of it. like you say, if we could get rid of those turds, we'd have it made."
look at that son of a bitch.

"okay, i'll do it at 10."
"okay; any time we're doing that - i assume that means like in - when we're doing the landmark tracking, both high and low, and it's my under- standing from the comments we got now that the only time 509 can get me in trouble is if i leave it enabled during thrusting."
okay. and 5b8 is another sample of that material - a little dustier.
"okay, ron. we got that."
"isn't that neat, the way stuff just floats around?"
(laughter) that's the greatest.
we're looking at 4 point ... -

"hey, ron. we hear an intervalometer going off every 20 seconds - -"
"okay, everything is in order up to this point as far as the checkout goes with the exception of the loc. when we pushed in the lgc circuit breaker, we got a program light. with a 400, an ri, a verb 5 noun 9 gave us - gave us an 1105, which seems to be of little consequence. just thought you might like to know."
okay; let's go to narrow. 09 06 35 12 imp okay.

"okay, got those two. got a couple of pictures there, houston. let me tell you what my camera reading is now, and then we can try to keep up with it from time to time. next time, i'll come over here by pete and we'll - -"
"and, john, when you bag that, we'll need a bag number."
"jack, just for information, the last heart rate we had was 103; and it's - we lost data right now, so 103 is max we saw right now."

yes.
it's just a backup monitor anyhow s_d se it's - setving it to 100 is probably the first thing to do.
okay. we change that to 3.4.
"bob, you got any of the lmies in there today? 1 cc any of your lmies? roger. they're all sitting by. just gave me a big thumbs up, jack."

"okay, houston. we're station""keeping at about 120 feet or so."
"ail righty. i would say, houston, that most of these boulders are the same brow_lish gray that we've fouu_d. but we see one that is definitely almost white in color. a very definite differ- ence in color, which we'll document. we noticed that beneath this dark brown regolith, there is a very light brown layer. and i think we'll get a - a core tube right here to show that. as a matter of fact, i think i'll do that right now."
"okay. and you might as well scratch out those words where it says ""eat period"" on that line, and down at 181:23, add ""p41 - p41."""
"eagle, this is houston. do you read? over. 03 11 15 40 i/4p houston, this is eagle. roger. read you loud and clear. how me? over."

off to 2 o'clock. it has no rim to it -
"- - two things that look like flows. one of them is a - yeah. well, i - obviously, that's one of the things that - and i don't think we're gonna be able to answer that question; at least, i can't. but i - it looks like - it looks just like the - material that you see coming down the side of the mountains to the north of flagstaff. i know that's lava, but whether this is the same sort of thing or not i don't know, because there's so many places on the back side where you see what appears to be flow lines and if you follow them far enough, you find some pla - place where they get lost. now this one is a - has a real dark set of material - and when i say real dark, i mean dark compared to the rest of the moon. and it's - it seems to be - consisting of two different flows, or two different units: one - much lighter and closer to the regular lunar surface; both of them are darker though, and the dark ones look like the same kind of dark material - i'd say it looks the s_ne as what you see in subtle expressions in the little domes in king and along the central peak."
okay.
"okay. i understand you dumped it into the src and the bag's o_ the rover, still."
"and the third one; there's king and then one, two, three craters up to the north - it looks to me like this stuff along the - the - the easternmost of these two tails that come north out of king, which is - has the whitest material around here, that - that stuff that runs along a - a topographic rise, looks like a plateau, and then this plateau sort of drops off as it goes over. there's a couple of craters - i just get the general impression that these things drop off as they go along. every- thing around king has these same lineations running - right now they're running generally - generally radial to king. 05 09 30 5b cmp all these black things that are in there - along those little white peaks in the northern end of king - are places where there's boulders and things that are sticking out of the sides - the same as we see in central peaks _l_ost everywhere else, except here there seem more of them along the walls. on the western wall, those just seem to be places where the residual mnterial is hang- ing out, sticking together consolidated. i think this is all slumping. you can see places where there's a - looks like a piece is pulled out of the side, and there's a lot of slump down below it. then there's big pieces that have seemingly resisted. then on the - out on the western rim, there's one of these real white spots, just a different color. the floor, is not that must dif- ferent in texture, but it's just a real different color. as i look north up along those rays, it doesn't look any different. you don't get any more impression of anything than you do by looking at the photographs we have. now the thing that i do see as i look to the north-northwest of king is that, going up towards sir don [?] rille, we see a - another large crater here, very subdued, and - all along its walls are these places where it looks like something is draped; and i'm trying to figure out now whether that's slumped down or splashed up. i can see the margin - and i just can't tell which way it's going. apparently, those are slumps coming down. that seems to fill all of those craters along there, and - and the demarcation without the binoculars makes it look like they're sliding up the sides of - of the craters, and with the binoculars, it looks like maybe they're - coming down the sides. and you see a lot of these very light, bright patches, and you don't see that in the highlands material any- where else. and now i'm looking at these things that look like exactly swirls. and the material has - from this angle, it looks like nothing but coloration; no other differences whatsoever. except there are places where i know some of these swirls do indeed have - have topographic expression; i can see that. but then there's other places where it looks like the swirl is just sort of a colora- tion that's on the surface. the general texture of this material hasn't changed any, the albedo hasn't changed a great deal, but the color has kind of darkened a bit."
okay.
(laughter) what kind of tape did that bag have on it when you opened it? (laughter)
"sps injector valves, gimbal motors, tvc - -"

"okay. well, let's do that thing and get it - get something done on it, because i'm gonna have to watch it."
mar}[.
"al, we'd be pleased to have any general comments you had about the sim bay experiments, otherwise than what we 'ye specifically asked you. did every- thing look in order?"
okay. i'm not proposing you change it. i'm just suggesting you consider the big flap that goes on when three guys have to suit up in here.
affirmative. had a beautiful lift-off. got to watch all of it almost.
"yeah, it's okay. ©kay, i'm in the house."
"twenty-four frames per second for 2 seconds, you want? let's wait until we get an answer from them on the pcm."
"gee, i wonder what it feels like to be at 8 to 10."
"just for kicks, though, i'm going to show you one on frame ss that is really fascinating. and i'm just on the eastern rim of ptole_aeus. i mentioned it last time. i'm going to take a little strip of these."
"okay. pitch, minus 28; yaw, 96. and stu will be in in a little while to talk about changes to your entry checklist. but that should do it for the flight plan. all your systems looked nominal through the night. we don't know about the mid- course 7 yet. right now, you're in the corridor and it looks - it looks pretty good - like maybe you won't have to do one. if you did one, it wouldn't be any more than a foot and a half."
roger.
"pressure looks good, still."
question 10: could you - -
"okay, karl. i'm ready to copy tei-12. r"
"okay, now we got to in - reinstall the hool - the tool harness."
"okay. and, the sample bags are on the ***dividual - seats, joe. i'm going to get the rake."
"well, according to the pitch meter, it's not. it's pegged out."
"wait a minute, is that it? is that it out there straight ahead?"
"well, but you knows one thing that may distinguish it is the - the bright-halo craters are brighter."
okay. do a verb 22 noun 79.
"- - ... copy this or - okay, i'll just copy this on a scratch pad, and we'll put it in the appropriate place, if that sounds reasonable."
that's what i'd do; carry it or something.
"okay, i gave you two lists - -"
okay. and could i get your final frame count?
okay. so the kind of thing you want me to look for are information only. is that affirmative?
"okay° the lmp: cinnamon toast bread, mixed fruit, instant breakfast, coffee, lemonade, peach an_rosia, one vitamin, one slice of bread, grapefruit drink, gingerbread, orange drink_ and i have one com- plaint. somebody slighted me on a caramel candy in meal c."
"okay, that time when i went to do a verb 40, just about the time it should have run its time out and blanked the dsky, we got another program alarm, and a - shows 3777 again."
"roger, dave, and power external, tv remote."
okay. i understand.
"yankee - yankee clipper, houston. i have the maneuver pad when you're ready to copy."
i'm going to clean those critters this morning.
"roger. understand. start it normally at t-start, and if it is in barber pole, just leave it until __ aos."
"okay, i copy that."
"okay. and next, on the second line under the noun 68, there's a comment that says ""negative (if plus: ems)."" and there's a certain amount of unhappiness with that statement down here. they say that you can have a positive h-dot in p67 nominally and, therefore, the statement on the cue card that this is a fail indication is not a good idea. i understand vance discussed this with a1 beforehand."
roger. i have some switches and circuit breakers we waist you to take care of to try to improve the corem s_tuation. i'll _ive them to you as soon as you're ready to copy.
"crater, if you will. i know you didn't get a chance to look at it because - if we can tie up the - what you see from orbit on shorty to what we know we've got from the ground truth, we might really have something here, as far as matching up on some of these other craters."
he told us to go ahead.
okay -
okay. will we be jettisoning at about this attitude? that's okay. i'll align the ags with the pgns. you can tell me a little later if you need some help.
"okay, in the meanwhile, i'm going to take the computer. give me a holler when you are ready. 0_ 12 26 00 lmp okay, now - i am going to start shooting him, now."
roger (laughter). 06 oh 03 52 cmp next thing you're going to want to know how it came to be there.
okay.
"unfortunately, owen wasn't listening."
"affirmative, jim. close the deca power."
"okay, charlie. do you have that pin in john's suit yet?"
okay.
"tony, you ... look anywhere but - well, i mean the gear's working exactly like we - and i'll tell you, those guys - covington and all of them and jerry ... and bob kain and that group are all - ... - they were all slave drivers, but it's really paying off, i'll tell you."
"colt_nbia, this is houston. are you aware that eagle plans the eva about 4 hours early? over."
... 80 degrees - - 03 15 54 06 cml° 80 and - what time is it?
"and if it's okay, i'll cycle the h2 fans."
okay; the rest of the test was go.
*** (col ia)
right - right - we're going to pass over it in just a second. you can probably see it out dick's window. two of them: three of them.
roger.
okay; let me get your straps with the tool harness.
i thought i put it in the top pocket.
"i think we were. the - the original impression had been mostly volcanics to look for, and i don't think we found the - the highest percentage of volcanics as we had originally anticipated. so the rocks that we found were unique, that we had never seen before in any of the lunar samples, we feel, and so it was a surprise."
"yes, right."
"if you always - as soon as you take sc_ething off, put the cap on. you'll never have a bubble. and i need to - 07 22 03 33 _ defecate."
"roger, pete. looks good."
"tony, if we'd have gone - okay. if we'd have gone to 353 on survey originally, we'd have been down in a big depression."
"yes, sir. and you're looking good, just as stable as a rock. go ahead."
"dave, you're loud and clear."
"okay, thank you."
"okay, two ullage breakers going closed."
"yeah, you ought to have a little sun. well, it's really - ought to end up in here."
they're both host rocks; we can put them in the same bag.
**_ just about 1 second off. *** on. timer's set. it's right on. o_ 11 52 23 cdr okay.
roger.

roger; p63.
"okay. 04 08 17 lb lmp if no ignition, you start pushbutton, if we get ullage."
h0 -
"okay, and copied, ed. and was there any noticeable dust on the large boulder?"
everybody's happy with it down there?
"bmag mode, three of them, att 1/rate 2."
"copy that. and when we leave we want to take ep number 8 with us, guys. %_e'd like the sep turned back on and the blankets closed. okay, jack, i guess that's your option, you may - -"
go ahead.
all the way out there. it is?
"that's really a beautiful sight, though."
no kidding. huh. okay - -
"okay. trans control power, on."
i've sort of lost track - -
go.
47 degrees.
"that's affirmative, columbia. it's about 4 miles long. stand by. we'll have you a map location momentarily. over."
"al, you can go to block now. we've had some con- flict in cow--ands in that update to you and you got your lr - rls update, but you didn't get the new refsmmat."
- - on that chain of craters you described?
suit loop's fine. it's - that was more than 30 seconds. that was a minute and - -
roger.
"i've had two gingerbread bars and a brownie, so far."
"houston, columbia went uptei,emetry comnand, (columbia) reset, to reacquire on the high gain."
"oh, there's all kinds of tape around here."
"charlle, we - we would like to get the memory dump, and we'd like to keep the high gain until we get that."
in?
"okay, bob. she went in - she's going in like she's in some pretty dead stuff, and then i hit some rock here. i'll watch it - i won't lean forward. i'm not putting too much pressure on it."
m_k. 07 02 hl _6 cmp got you.
"roger. you're really down low, scresming across, huh?"
"yes, mar - marginis is the name; right."
yes.
"okay, thank you."
"i'll turn this camera off, pete. i'll check descent reg pressure, pete."
happy?
"casper, could you get the laser altimeter on, please?"
i'm glad there were - - cdr-ii4 i thought that - - lmp-l_ i'm glad there were two of us.
i'll do that rate gyro test while you're doing that. ' lmp good.
"go ahead, 15."
"now we're going again, joe."
okay. copy that.
"okay, al. are you ready for the sim bay questions?"
that should - that should do it. okay.
you know -
"that's the cockpit temperature. i've been noticing a little gage, and it (laughter) - it doesn't ever move. i think it's got a - i think it's plugged into a dummy load somewhere. but the cockpit temperature does, in fact, change quite a bit. and on the way out, in ptc with the three of us in here, it never really got cool enough even for people as warmblooded as charlie and i. and we were wondering, you know, gee, if it was like that in ptc, what was it going to he like when we got in orbit. and the first day in orbit there, it was - it really was kind of hot and stuffy. and i don't know when it got cool, but last night it was nice and cool. and, in fact, i woke up this morning because i was cold. that was the reason i woke up. and in the past, i've had a hard time sleeping sometimes, because it was warm. i don't know whether that's a - that's caused by going to the 60-circular orbit, or whether that's caused by having only one body to take care of in here, instead of three. but it was very obvious. unfortunately, we'd get a chance to - i couldn't tell you yesterday. i was wearing a suit, and so it was never really comfortable most of the day. maybe when john and charlie get back, we'll notice again, and see if it gets hot again."
"3, 2, i -"
"they - then - then, they have your error. right there, they'd know what the error was you put in. apparently, it doesn't do that. it just freaks up the way their processers work. if you - -"
"yes, it works. okay, 1 and _ on high taps."
not quite at 65 yet. wonder why it's - -
yeah. 04 04 31 16 _ okay. i just wondered. he looks like to me he's moving on out there some.
"don't worry about it, dave. we see you starting to come into view now. - -"
"okay. a cross-check with houston prior to pdi, and we're not going to bother you unless you want to say something. looking for you - not going to say anything unless i call you."
the ... we're approaching - -
"oh, oh. let's get that baby. get it. okay. i'll hold it open. yes, because that water - -"
"now turn out all the mdc lights, and just let - watch the dsky leb - if - if you can find one down there."
"... let you lean on me. lmp-ema no, i got it."
"okay, rob, i guess we didn't have the gamma ray out, so it's going out now."
"no_ we're just going to turn it off now. i'm sorry, charlie."
"endeavour, this is houston. we'd like to have the gamma ray gainstep up three times, please."
"okay. to the west, it goes clear on over to africa. but to the south, it cuts off about 30 south, or not quite all of australia."
okay. no sweat. i got the gamma-ray gainstep back on.
"that's a good point, john."
"america, houston. don't bother to answer, but we'd like h2 tank 2 fans-off. that's hydrogen tank 2 fans, off."
"bmag mode, three, to rate 2."
okay.
he doesn't - he doesn't want to get pregnant.
"when i put out the skirt of this foil, it doesn't want to lie down. i guess because it's been folded so long. i guess i can just probably just put it out. it acts almost like it's got an electrostatic charge on it that's resisting the lunar surface. i'm sure that isn't it."
both reset.
"that's affirmative. you will be running right into the sun; and directly at your 9 o'clock posi- tion, you'll see the lm; a couple of more steps and you'll be right there."
okay. tape9_/48
"now, if you look at the massifs, jack. i don't know if you can see it over here. see, they're almost like a series of linear boulder tracks, but they come crossways down the slope. *** looks like there may very definitely be some - *** there's outcrop on top the massif, too."
"roger, houston. the only trouble is that the sun (tranq) is in number 5, the closed one. and it appears to also b_ close enough to detent 6 to shine on the far side of the cone. and it completely obscures detent 6. i'm - unable to use that at all."
"stand by on that, jim. 05 18 12 146 cc aquarius, llouston. 05 18 12 118 cdr go ahead. 05 18 }2 49 cc roger. we want you to go to the service module sep attitude. 05 18 ]2 54 cdr okay."
- - says it's just ... - he got word from the back room that farouk and his boys are ecstatic. and the sim bay stuff is all working very well.
"okay, jim. we copy starting with 224, 60529, 29402, 60406, 00572, 32664, 54401. load 373 with plus 08574; 254 plus 08817. over."
"okay. the heat flow is level; the gnomon is good. and, bob, i verified that that dirt is not on the mirror. it's on - on the white stuff that - that, you know, is horizontal to the surface of the box."
"hey, jim?"
roger.
"jim, we're happy. give us an emu status check, please. we'd like a frame count off of dave's camera, and then we're ready to move out."
"i - didn't get that soil bag number, gene - jack."
"see any color tones on that crater at all, ron?"
"roger, challenger. we need a 623 plus 10,000 in the ags. over. _-lm well, those are the angles. cm_-lm how about an - an omni - -"

"oh, i'd believe that."
"let me show you something. how easy it is in 1/6 gravity. now, lend me your flashlight."
tt_at's right.
"no, sir. sure didn't."

"okay, houston. you have it."
okay.

"man, i still got a clump of air. now let's monitor - -"
okay.
i don't think you're closing.
"roger. the lmp and cdr have recycled the impedance pneumogram, and we just wondered if you'd seen any improvement in data."
"oh, that's a good name. good name for a big crater."
"ron, we're watching the cabin. it's 2.2. i'll give you a call at 3."

i beg your pardon?
"and, ed and al, we've already eaten in our 30-minute extension, and we're past that now. i think we'd better proceed with the sampling and continue with the eva."

"yes. now we're getting into the blocky stuff - about 1 foot, quite angular, irregular surface."
"aquarius, enter on the 203."
"hey, you know, i haven't - hadn't gotten around to looking for planets. that's what i was doing the other night when - when things went to worms, and i decided they're probably trying to tell me something. it really is pretty out there, the way you can see all those stars. they - they really stand out. looks like a planetarium, there's so many."
"okay. and i guess over in the notes column, we're still carrying 11101. right?"
i show us now at about 0.9 of a mile. is that correct?

you got a couple in the roll pretty soon.
"okay. ready to copy the power removal from the command module/lm umbilical. 0)j!5 35 _°= _.,.,._. i'm ready to copy. go ahead. oh 15 35 40 cc okay. this assumes t_at all the descent batteries are on ]ine and ascent battehry 6 is on _ormal feel), as we said earlier. first thing you do is go in the csm and look on panel 5 circuit breaker. lm t'ower-2 main b, op,_n; lm power-1 main a, open; c_rcuit breaker eps ',_i]ns(s)irgnal main b, open. 04 15 36 18 cm_p hey, jack."
.... 56.
"roger. 00 00 l_ l0 lmp houston, can you confirm - main bus tie a/c, off?"
"right now. 05 22 42 53 _,_ okay."
"okay, you've got p00 and data. okay, we're off hot mike now."
...
"say again, bob?"
"and, ron - -"
okay.
"ye_ah,.it'_ a_l right."
"now, i'll dump the potable - potable, too."
you're coming through my side.
do you have an earthrise?
roger. just a reminder you have to disable charlie and delta here as you've done in the past. over.
"i'll do the gamma ray and mass spec booms se- quentially afterwards, so i can pay a_tention %_ the times."
they're off.
roger; 253.
that sure was a sporty lift-off.
"okay, challenger. there's no change to 047 and 053. i do have a k-factor for you."
"15, this is houston."
"go right. fire again .... left. good one. up forward, forward. good one. good. good. okay let me turn the page. ""pgns rate comms_nd (cold fire), ags pulse."" cb it, attitude di?_ect, alcse, !l!_lp6t2_/27"
"yes, sir, bob. it'll be there."
"tranquility, houston. i have your lm ascent and csi data pad's when you are ready to copy."
"okay. sorry to hear that. 0i 21 15 45 cc ron, we see your 52; and you can go ahead and torque."
"yes. yes, we'll take it sort of slow here going down-sun. 06 o0 59 40 imp-eva yes, we're heading 278."
switch ...
roger.
"okay, the residuals were - for the pgns after the trim - were plus .2, plus .2, and minus .4."
all that's there.
"yes, that's pretty straightforward. okay, i see the earth so i've very wisely shifted to forward. 03 10 4h 17 cc good boy."
"roger. houston, apollo 11. loud and clear. (goss net 1) tape 2/5"
"houston, america."
okay. panel 380. suit circuit return valve to closed.
"ken, how do you read? over."
"well, and there's - you know - there's places on a spacecraft you could make it on, where you could put a - you could - you could put some ... - -"
there's a better way.
"okay, geno."
"no, where?"
"okay, we're all set. when do we get the 210 up, jim?"
"i'd better be watching the flight plan for this page, because there are a lot of little notes i put in there that -"
"okay, what you would do then is - we're gonna set saturn dap in average g in order to prevent coarse aligning in the event middle gimbal picks up spurious signals. and to do vhis, we set verb 48 with a noun 46. digit a is set to a 3, and we set the average g flag with a verb 25 noun 07, address 75, bit t, set it to the 1. then we should call p52 normally, and if the glitch occurs, it'll be ignored. i assume from this if the glitch occurs s_ne time while we're in the process of taking marks, that we get some kind of garbage out of p52, b_ it should be obvious. and from what you gave me on this list up at the top, it looks like no:_mally we would not run across tvc enable during that period. at the completion of a 52, we go back into a verb 48, and now we take noun 46 back to its original values. then we reset the average g flag by taking channel 75 bit 1 to a zero, using verb 2_: noun 07, and the restrictions on this em_ is shat we will not use verb 46 at any sime while this is punched in, 02 02 48 oh cc that's affirmative, ken."
"okay. just a second here. i'm stuck, can't get this - (laughter). oh, mr. clean. you guys are so dirty. i'm going to make you sleep in the tunnel. let's see. h2 -"
1.
"okay, it's azimuth, 100; and elevation, 77."
okay. let's try it now.
okay.
okay. good enough.
okay - -
"it looks about equal; that's right. very interest- ing. i don't know what the means of transport, but it's - it's just built up around it."
"and after that, an attitude of 184.28, 5.82 - -"
"the biomf_d is off, jim. ' 04 00 31 50 cdr i've drifted off in attitude."
okay.
"about 4.0, and the cabin is 0.3."
two.
good move.
stand by.
"okay, here's 5 - 5 - here's a pretty pristine area right over here, john, we haven't been walking - we can just go over here and get it. take the shovel down there and i'll - is that 5 meters?"
"okay. okay, we're at 5, ken, at 600 feet. make it 540 feet."
"okay. well, no problem. cml° ... --"
"well, i'm sure they do, and i don't mean to short- change our geology - geology back room, jack, but on the other hand, i think - i think really we're just waiting to get the answers from you or tie up maybe their thoughts with you. and i, you know, from a bystander's standpoint, if i read you anything that they've - maybe conclusions that they may have made, we just may be fudging the data because there's - -"
m__rk.
40 percent.
"yes, that rake may be a good thing - because it doesn't look like we're going to have any - piles of chips around."
and the first one is from the upper 2 centimeters.
okay. good.
yes. sure - - _ day 1 % page 39
"falcon and endeavour, this is houston. evidently neither of you are reading each other. we'll stand by until you get overhead and give it another try. i'll give you a cue. over."
"and, endeavour. it's your computer."
"i don't know whether i can get that or not. let me see. 05 lh 32 49 lmp we'll get it. that a boy. there you go. 05 14 33 oh cdr okay, let's head for blocky crater; _ick up a couple of more of these enroute."
"okay, 172:29:39.00."
"yeah. every time you put it up against there, it le_,_ ._ mmmmm mm.a.. . ..j"
"15, this is houston. how do you ready"
"bob, do we have an extra ep?"
okay. how mauy did you have to start with?
"and - yes, that cm-5 is ... okay, about six of them around sulpicius gallus there. there's 22 to 500."
"okay, gordy. we're down - we got the pyros safed and we're just about to go to po0."
"roger. lmi° okay. okay, gor - gordy, the ir is coming off now."
just be comfortable. just be comfortable. you got another week to go.
"we are, jim. i got it hot for you. don't worry, pal, we won't forget you."
"yeah, maybe. there's so many subtleties to this program we ain't figured out yet. lot of °.., very subtle things. that's why ... glitches. i'm just amazed that we worried about anything happening."
"that's all right. look at that. i thought it was rela - this must be fra mauro we're going over. 0b 14 08 32 lmp can't tell, pete."
i cleaned them up for you. what more could you ask?
"houston, this is endeavour. be advised falcon's going hi bit rate, we'll give you another call."
okay?
(laughter)
okay_ charlie.
"it's just fine, karl."
i been work - i been working on that all morning.
...
"and we're going up a slight slope, following our track."
"yeah, we don't even -"
"okay. thanks a bunch, guys. we'll being talking to you again in a minute."
... 00 00 35 08 _ you want to ... them all?
"okay, let me teli you w_t 2% was, gordon, i think, is the - the outlet was - was accidently open, probably at - at some other time, and the - the bypass was closed and the inlet was - was open. that's probably been the indications on the line. 00 o0 19 _7 cc roger. understand."
"houston, america; the waste stowage vent valve is closed."
okay.
"- - do not pick it up. okay, go ahead, jack. tape97a/19"
okay. normal repress. aria 2 (rev 2) -_.
"damn good, i'll tell you."
i never got the true picture of this before today. 3-71
good thing we're well coordinated human beings.
okay.
"okay, stand by. okay, go ahead."
okay that.
i say it's searching now. i don't have a visual. 05 22 00 33 l_ okay. we'll give him a tracking light.
okay.
- - we're showing a slightly high 02 flow. we're just wondering if all the waste compartment vents and all your dump vents are closed as per the flight plan.
"okay, standing by. and i'd like to verify the cryo configuration with you and make sure that - i'll leave a battery a on charge overnight. there's no lithium canister change tonight and it looks like when you get the up-link in and i give you a verb 74, we'll be through."
you have - -
i'll be ...
_ud then the rest of you will stand on your heads.
... going at 50 feet per second.
...
"okay, apollo 13. over."
"no, that's not until 46. we got some time on that. it's a verb - change of noun 78."
huh!
that's affirmative.
"... up there. could have stopped in the middle, i guess. okay."
what if those bugs get out of - get out into here with a- -
okay. have you - are you in attitude hold now?
"yes, they're both open, and all four have been dusted."
roger. that and m_ scm. okay. that'll hold steady.
it's in the volkswagen pouch down there.
mark it.
roger.
"you're upside down compared to me, and when you say down s you mean you're going - you're going down on me. is that correct?"
...
i was saying. it was 1.80.
"the computer's yours, 16. 10 03 49 15 imp okay, hank; and we've got the fans on."
i don't think you ought to.
okay. we hadn't planned to take our suits off; we're just going to break off the helmets and gloves so we could get something to eat.
no.
i don't know. whatever it took.
apollo 11. roger. we got all that.
"okay, proceed, 16. 3"
"... come on all day, you know? ... never see them again."
"roger, apollo 12. send your contact report, please."
yes; okay.
does everything look good up in the tunnel for the burn ?
"roger. pc plus 2, sps/g&n; 66313; plus 1.23, minus 0._2; 080:29:13.47; plus 3189.4, minus 2437.0, minus 1356.5; 175, 079, 332; all other is na; ullage, none; other, burn equals sps docked. over. /-"
okay.
look at all the water's coming out of that thing.
"well, i tell you, i woke up at one time - and i listened to the noise, and i thought the thing was off. i thought to m_self, ""great, somebody got up and turned the cabin fan off."" 0b 22 l0 ll lmp i was burning up down there. i just about got up and got the hoses - ... them down there. 0b 22 l0 16 cdr boy, you should have done that before you went to bed. get yourself some air."
"the first thing we arc going to do is to coarse aline the platform an6 get it inertial_ based on the refsb94at that you have in the present slot inside the cmc. we'll then go - and do a p52, option h - correction, option 1."
"just to put your mind at rest a little bit about eva-i, we're looking at a pretty nominal eva-1. we'll probably give you some new targets for the uv camera, and we can do that real time, eandwe won't have the tv when you get out. we'll get it when you get the lcru ap. but otherwise, it looks pretty - pretty nominal right now."
"sure did. it snapped right off. yes - yes, they're supposed to be used to prepare ... if you need them."
"how many chutes we got, al?"
can you get that? thank you.
"roger. we're seeing it, fred."
"hold up, vance."
that's what this is. this isn't rocks.
we believe you now.
"that's verified. it's dark in here. oh. okay, i'm going to push cabin repress circuit breaker, if i can turn around here."
"hank, are you still there?"
"houston, america."
that - -
"okay. we copy that one, jack."
...
"go ahead, dave."
"iu up tel, accept."
"and digital event timer is set, po0, spacecraft control, cmc, auto. maneuver to pad burn att 2; we did that; zero, zero, zero; boresight and sextant star check. what about boresight star check? rasalhague, huh? i didn't know we had to do one of those. hey, there it is, by god. yes. prob- ably see it."
"and, houston, i saw at least two other examples of impact craters in the highlands south of seren- itatis and south of the sulpicius area that had veinlike distribution of red, brown, or orange material in them."
"hey, houston; this is 17."
we've got l0 minutes to go.
"well, it'll go in there. it's not that big."
surge tank 02 coming off.
"okay, bob. we copy all that. obviously, you're going to have to catch us in real time on some of the details there - on the charges and the task deletion. one question, did you say we were going to delete the trench at station 3?"
want to take them off?
ail right. why don't you?
what?
"it does change vibration modes with the mass, doesn't it? 00 02 32 05 c'n_ okay. there's 3:30."
"no. that's - that's not the problem, jack. i think our concern was more that you - that you were taking enough - enough onboard internally."
bumping anything?
"okay, hank. i'm not sure how to answer block 6. i'll go to block 12 if you like."
okay.
"aeld, abort stage."
"okay. a minus 4. thank you, jack - -"
"apollo 15, this is houston. we're having some ground problems in communications networks, and we'd like to have a comm check."
"okay, jack. and we have - -"
"okay, close the secs - -"
there's nothing else - -
yeah.
outstanding. that's got to be a first.
"roger, mike. good readbaek. out. (goss net 1) tape 85/4"
well - -
"and that's - your cue. you know, all you need, i guess, is the ignition signal - when the light's on."
"i hope you did a good job, john."
we're chewing on it.
okay. fuel cell purge is complete.
that's affirmative. pull atca pgns open.
"no. keep the knob up. there, you got it."
"10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 -"
"aha!! look at that piece! here, let me get it, john. back up. i'll go get it. there it is right there."
- - so my maneuver is not going to hurt them.
okay. sounds good to me. sounds like a good - good candidate for a cap.
"i understand that it got a little warm during the day and cooled down a little bit when you put the shades up, but you're still a little bit warm. do you have any moisture condensation or an?thing like that on the wall? (goss net 1) tape 18/8"
"okay, good show. and we'll need a reference soil."
"okay. yeah, all right. fine."
"well, just the general thing that they pass around after a - a day or so, i think, is the time frame they work in."
"- - take the filter off the front of my camera, would you?"
go ahead.
"*** go to the - oh, you go to sep. that's right."
okay. and you've got an image motion. you want barber pole.
"well, you just can't get a grip on it."
roger. we're standing by.
"both walking hinges were open, joe."
"henry, another thing that turns out to be a - a pretty nice little gadget is these nets that are in the stowage comrartments. particularly when you get in the food locker when it's about half full. _nings are able to stay under some semblance of control. and that's a mighty nice thing."
"that's affirmative. well, actually, hank, i just tried it in ma_al. it occurs when - the noise occurs whenever i'm in an extremely high rate. you know, like using high in a max shaft rate."
"you know, houston, this is america_ i guess i.uthe terms of some of the grumman people,_ down in flori_ut, the lm is a ""wop-off."""
"and, rover, you should be able to easily follow your tracks - -"
roger; it's in the flight plan. but it's just before you're going to get busy on that orbital science photo. you might of - you might go to the window earlier or something.
"okay, houston. that - that does the pan camera pass over hadley rille, and you can let me know when the lens is tucked in."
yes. that's what we thought. apollo ll air-to-ground voice transcription (goss net 1) tape 102/1
"okay: 114 is x, 361 is y, 356 is z."
"oh, okay ... 04 22 24 3b cdr go ahead and get one more. zing. i feel like ebeneezer scrooge or something whistling across the plain."
...
understand.
"well, i think i'm more or less on your track. it wiggled a little bit."
"11, houston. buzz, how does the alignment look, there?"
"no, it's got a bag around it - it's all bagged."
"hey, jim. we got about a 3-degree r011 command in."
"roger, jack. is that with the monocular you're looking at it?"
"no, we missed you. 0_ 05 45 07 cc okay. i'll - i'll try it again here. the service module rcs secondary propell_t fuel pressure switches, four, open. and the purpose for that is to prevent primary tank fuel _ank depletions during tei."
"hey, loud and clear."
"well, we better take a look. okay, i'm coming over there."
off what?
okay. 08 08 31 18 imp she's gray.
looks like an excavated bedrock.
"intrepid, houston."
you caught a boulder with your wheel as you went _round that corner (heavy breathing).
"mark; gene. it's a very short - very short line, upper left hand of left eye going towards the right."
what do you need?
"jack, would you mind opening the vent and watching the system meter concurrently with it? l_ stand by."
"how do you read, houston?"
"okay. stand by, america. we just barely read you. go ahead. c_ okay_ just a second. i can read you loud and clear now."
"let's worry about - let's worry about it at sta- tion 7, if we're going to worry about it. press on."
"144:12. there we are. j, onfidentt. _"
"okay, dick [sic]."
"okay, if you ws_nt to - okay, that's right here - i'll move around to put the tv camera on the scientific equipment bay. 0b 19 03 10 i_p okay."
"go ahead, ron."
roger. we confirm skirt sep.
"0h, yeah. okay."
"okay, we've got the right bearing. we're at 1.4 now, joe."
okay.
okay. i got that.
here comes earthrise.
how you understand.
"***find the lec; hey, come on, babe."
station 4 was on the south side of it.
"if we can do it in the lm, i guess that'll relieve a lot of the load here."
"okay. station 7 is nominally 208 and 3.3, but it's any group of any significant boulders you want to stop at in reality."
"okay. we're heading out, tony."
let's check the aps card right now.
"r_nge/altitude monitor, range/raj_ge rate."
"no, it's not car. let me try it, jim, you just stay there."
okay.
"hello, aquarius; houston. how do you read?"
"apollo 16, houston. we'd like to get the main bus ties on a little early, as we talked about."
think we ought ...
"copy that. _4p-eva and pray for me, bob, that i don't lose my camera. okay. hanover is very- - quite a ways up the slope. i don't think we'd have gotten to it, as we planned that time. but the appearance you have of the scarp - north massif contact is one of the scarp being smoother textured, less eratered, and cer- tainly less lineated. and i wouldn't be a bit sur- prised if it's, as gene says, younger."
that son of a hitch ....
you don't think so?
"okay. we're going be tight. we're still doing the integrity check,"
"it's probably that - already, huh? yes .... down on there. l[,lp-eva rover - rover warning was up. 06 17 30 (!7 cdr-eva *** right there. ii._p-eva it 's down."

"you mentioned that the lineal chips were all on the - in the xx plane, and we're just wondering - do you mean along the xx axis of the spacecraft?"
"roger. john, you can anticipate a slight roll transient at ignition because of c.g. position; and, on the rcs, of course, we'll want normal configurasion. and your rcs quantity system a is off because of the high pressure in that system. it's off by about 13 percent. 04 07 56 56 cdr-iz okay."
"okay. go ahead, joe."
you're in.

"i got a poor map, ron. all i show is - next to neper, you have the border sea which is northwest of neper, called the border sea. i don't know if that's the proper term you want or not."
"okay. start 158:49:35, 158:54:38."
...?
aquarius_ are you reading houston?
in case you didn't get the clue.
"we're reading you now, al."
"6:28, okay. i think we'll skip the tv here and - get the rest of these things done."
every time i try to - i can't take that doggone roll out. i got to wait until they get around to the bellyband.
"got that etb to left floorboard? load etb, left side."
say when you need it.
"huh? they were not breccias, i guarantee you."
... 07 14 13 17 _ ... back over there.
"no, let's forget the down-sun."
4.2.
yes ... verify the red one.
"loud and clear, pete."
"okay. we po0, enter for no coarse align. okay. pro. 0_ 12 _6 50 cdr so we pro and enter."
boy howdy. that ...
"question number 15 - for dave and jim. how many times did each of you fall down on the lunar sur- face? did any of these falls hurt you or give you any problems? ll 06 47 57 _ well, i fell down twice, and it was never any real problem. actually, i could have got up very well by myself without any help."
let's try it.
"okay, forward hatch closed. let me see if i can't lock it. okay, it's locked."
roger.
"scme more light. 08 23 h2 33 cmp yes. thank you. beautiful. we need cmc, rate ccmm_rnd, in case we go scs; and, other than that, she looks goo_."
"well, i'll give an update. it - it's working per- fect. no problems at all, and we got good sim bay data on everything. the uv, the ir, the lunar sounder, and everything that %*e - every data point we can see is just great. it's - it's just hardly any anomalies at all. everything is just wonderful."
roger. sort of underneath where you probably had the solar side of the cosmic ray experiment there. between the ses - between the footpad and the atmep doors there.
we'll - we'll get the reading we need for the nay update. do you think you can give us the heading right now?
... the moon.
"okay, houston, i'm 351, e_rgency cabin pressure's off."
_m.s says we're going to have a slight overshoot.
you have a go for undocking from here.
"16, we're about a couple of minutes from los. everything is looking good, and while you're behind the moon, we'll change shifts and pick you upon the next rev."
...
keep after me.
... five.
we're in 35. 95 22 2_ 41 ____vl okay. verb 93.
- - i think that's what it was.
"no, we're not that close. uh-uh. cochise is up at - see that rim where those blocks are? ijqp-eva no, that's a small crater."
"hey, was that about what time you expected or was i - am i using it faster than normal?"
copy that.
"roger. understand we have update. it's coming in. and, ron, while we're sending it up to you, we'll also send you an update on the zero trunnion bias, as per the flight plan."
"... 42, the sep lights are out."
yes.
okay. good deal.
"fao, cap comm. is the tca time in the flight plan pretty good?"
"oh, i think that's a good idea. i don't think we're going to get any more variety of anything by going farther to the east on the - on the front, joe. i think we've seen the variety that we're going to see - except for working our way back."
"biomed switch, right."
"okay, i think you're going to be stuck with it."
...
"charlie, houston. 01 03 35 58 hmp go ahead."
"roger, jack."
"well, have lots of coffee anyhow. good night."
"okay; i'm on my way to the experiment. charlie, can you hold my feet there? 09 03 37 58 imp yeah, i got you."
that's affirmative.
"gordy, we're pressing on, but if you've got any good words, like news and what have you, where we are, we'd appreciate it."
let me - i'll get it for you.
97 03 30.
"yeah, we realize that, john. the problem is - we don't know what - what's causing the glitch. we just, at this time, can't say."
"houston, do you have the angles?"
"and, dave, you're setting a new outdoor record with each toss there."
"ckay. we're here. 03 16 oh 33 cdr mom, i coulin't have said i like that. terrible! 03 16 05 00 ipdd well, stu? we better get with it, baby. , confidential 03 16 c5 07 cer better start configuring the c:s_mera. finish dinner !at er."
okay.
"boy i just flat can't understand you. 05 23 48 05 i_p ... clear, 316 ..."
"and, 16, we're showing the image motio__, on, arid we'd like you to go off, if it is on. 08 08 51 0b cmp okay. that's in work. 08 08 5_ 05 cc roger."
that's affirmative. that's - that's why i wanted to wait until we're on the omni to make that switch.
i didn't want to touch anything.
"orion, houston. voice check."
it won't stay closed.
"waste water's off, huh?"
loud and clear. ieon fiden-
everything's okay.
"okay, nothing up in here that i see. no screw- drivers or anything - tools. okay. within a minute."
"is there anything else you want me to do while i'm out here, houston?"
good readback.
"okay, we got the message."
"okay, houston. we'd like to get a hack to set our mission timer here, jack."
okay; thank you.
"on the bottom - see, it looks like - a light gray microbreccia with some white clast of millimeter size in it, and that's about all. and, the bottom side has slickensides. and i do see some glass spattered on one side. and i also see - one little - looks like an orange crystal in there - like it might be a little piece of olivine. it's got definite reddish-orange color to it. --_"
"we're reading you loud and clear, ron. no problem."
me either. the fra mauro - -
"okay; 47. 08 23 _7 14 cdr needles converging. nicely. nicely. 08 23 _7 27 sc (sound of camera running) 08 23 47 28 lmi° okay, there's 20 seconds. rrt. 08 23 47 35 cmp see you're - now, see you're starting it here a gocd minute before a_nything happens."
we have a pitch 34. it'll probably stretch out after we go to the single bank insertion.
stand by.
"roger, gene."
and that's something you can do while you're packing the etb. can do it tonight. over.
"hello, houston. how do you read america? over."
"charlie, i'm gonna offload the lrv, i guess."
endeavour on omni charlie.
what time's the chronometer say?
"dead band, min."
"no, sir. we don't think so. we just thought may- you might have read it earlier."
okay.
"well, it may have been named by a gentleman whom this crater was named after, langrenus. langrenus was a cartographer to the king of spain and made one of the - one of the early reasonably accurate maps of the moon."
map_{. final comp.
okay. did you get all yo_r circuit breakers? 03 13 56 00 cml° i have done it.... again.
"this is one on the - about 50 meters right on the rim crest of henry, almost due - the west rim - due west rim. now locke is just ahead of us. it also has boulders in its walls but has relatively few on the rim."
okay.
yeah.
"naw, i gonna clean up the camera. wait a second; let me put this down - down right here. okay. i - i wanted to clean the camera off, too. get that dust out of there, or we'll never get the mags in. okay."
"say again, jim."
"stand by on that, ron. let me look at the book here. and i'll get farouk to help me out on that j'""/' one."
"that's enough, jack let me -"
"well, it's very soft and it's going to be very hard to level for it."
"twenty. hey, there's about a 4-meter boulder off to our - with a good fillet - -"
"no, that's correct. burn. maybe after the burn you can get a urine dump and purge on all those things so we can a_ the sim bay going later. that's okay_ but if you"
"i'll tell you, looking even that way, with that sun angle - oop - why, by golly, it's pretty bright. joe, i'm going to swing the camera around towards the ground. and now it's pointing back at the lm, but down. i want you to take a look as i move it up slowly. make sure that we're okay on what you see. okay?"
"and that thing is so friable. hey, i got it!"
"no, it's not in the mare floor at all. it's up there in the edge of the haemus mountains. but that was the same type of material; it has the same color difference as the - the material around the tacquet rilles back there. there now, see all those bright orange craters right in the - in the suipicius gallus rille, up at the north end of it? jack calls them an orangish-gray; i call them an orangish-tan."
"looks like you guys don't understand the problem, do you? i can't believe that. we all dumped the urine into the same bag."
ail rigr_ty.
... but we have to do this.
that's really the only thing.
"okay; 21129 and 22060. (no comm for 18 minutes) 07 05 00 27 i2_p-i2_ okay, tony. orion here. we've got the scbs in the sample containment bags; 7 is in 7, 6 is in 6, 4 is in 8. over. 07 05 00 h2 cc roger. jim's on now, charlie. give me those bag numbers again. and we have some information for that weight suzmt_afyfor you. 07 05 00 54 i2_p-lm okay. scb-7 is in sample containment 7. scb-6 is in sample containment 6. scb-4 is in sample con- tainment 8. over."
"select is in 1/2, the source is in attitude set, and the attitude set is in gdc."
"okay. i understand, vance. it's much easier if the ball is up to fly the needles; that gives me a drift of verb 49, 58g maneuver. we could fly that manually."
"i'll give it a try. wait for me there, just a second ..."
"here let me look at it. i'd say stay put, but i don't think you have any choice."
"i think that's it, but it's no1;a bit smoother than the other. i'll be darned if i know what to do. 04 _9 51 02 cdr well, we'll move on a little closer to doublet."
that's a smart one.
"what are you doing there, man?"
"16, want the mapping camera to standby, and the gtdv_a ray, shield on."
"out valve, close. 00 00 33 29 l_l° the in valve, close."
"okay, al. now i guess a - a word about biomed configuration, today. in order to get some very interesting base-line data, medical data on you, al - and, jim, for your eva coming up later - we're requesting that the two of you give us that biomed data today. i think, dave, you were scheduled for it, but i guess we'd prefer jim on the line with a1 to get base-line data for later. now, al, let - let me run through in just some blocks here the next revs as we see them, and the approximate activ- ities. and then i'll come up with specific data concerning those revs later on, perhaps actually during the revs. on rev 61, we're going to have the uv - -"
"okay, you're free, and i'm free. let me dock mine first, and i'll put mine in."
dsky blank?
go ahead. try me.
"yes, sir_ i'm sorry."
huh! _ we're moving it. i can't believe it!
we agree - we agree to that - -
that looks good.
sounds outstanding.
"ken, it's been running awhile. we're going to rewind it, and i'll get it back to you in a minute."
yes. 06 05 19 03 lmp-i_ but mine worked pretty good with - in the stowed -- position.
"no, no. we just noticed that they were closed at an hour. apparently in the shuffle here, somebody probably bumped the one switch, which would do it."
very good.
"okay. it's 0.4. we're about 20 meters up - 30 meters up above it, tony."
"yes, it sure would. i had that happen in the pre- chlorination there on the pad before launch. i had backed off on the nut and, instead of just filling up that ampoule, the water pushed the ampoule off the needle and then, once it's done that, the water just goes back around and comes out those two holes. 02 10 53 29 cml° well, i can't say that didn't happen. the first problem occurred with the chlorine injection."
okay. can you stand on the porch?
"okay. *** on the gravimeter, huh?"
okay; it's converging.
"yes sir, i'll do that. jack, here, let's get the antennas."
"shutdown. pro, charlie. 07 07 39 0i l_p pro. super, no trim. 07 07 39 oh cdr okay, 07 07 39 07 l_ insertion!"
"ail right, got it in sight. it dug in real well, too. it's probably - it's right, in fact, it's right - dug in right to the top of the - -"
number 2 is right.
okay. stick it in there ....
"okay. you have a uht still on. 04 22 12 07 _p okay, i'll take it."
that did it.
you ready to retract?

okay. we want you to power up your eight-ball. we want you to get your rcs heaters on. pres- surize the rcs and open up the main sovs. over.
"columbia, houston."
okay. i got it (chuckle).
"okay, the battery compartment is sitting right at 1.5 volts. so, i guess the next time we go to do a dump and stuff, it wouldn't hurt to vent that, too."
"well, i thought we wanted to keep them on."
"roger. i understand. eagle will power down the comm, and we are just approaching 27 volts now. it looks like we won't have to bother with the high taps."
5.1.... ?
roger. we copy.
"and be advised, i have some new rendezvous radar angles for you, dave. i'll explain them when we get there."
okay.
"he's going to get a quick grab here of a rock, and i'll - i'll photograph it because it's got same tremendous fillets in it."
"t_nar£_you. 07 05 36 55 l}_ fine! %tiank you, al. good to be back."
"well, i don't have any direct sunlight on my wheel. it may be off at - let's see if i can get some direct sunlight on it through this other window now. looks like somewhere around 8; maybe a - 7 or 8. it doesn't match any of these things. it's always off a little bit. everything you have up here. it's very frustrating. you'd think it ought to agree, but it doesn't. it's like a lot of tests; you can't tell when you're on, you can only tell when you're off. it looks like it might go some- where between 8 and 9 when i hold the lighting card in the - in the shadow of the spacecraft. it's somewhere between 8 and 9, and i get the impression - i'm gonna try the tans and see how they do. well, they don't do so badly either; it's 14 - nope, that far off. and the one we picked yesterday was 17. that was in the direct sun, and that's - i think that makes a difference. i think these colors lose their - some of their vividness when they get in bright sunlight. okay. we're now coming up - let's see, time for a camera change to - o5 o9 25 o2 cmp 1/250,f/5.6."
yes.
"find the flight plan, too, while up there."
"hello, a-_rica; this is houston. good morning, sir."
i do not read you. do you read me?
are those the high gains we use?
okay; understand. one quick word from fao's - -
i don't think i will ever find it in here.
okay. i'll get the image motion now. - 05 08 08 50 cc okay. you're 10 seconds to a - t-stop.
you got 8 seconds grace.
"falcon, houston. computer's yours."
"roger. that's bessel you're talking about. the top of serenity? no, no the one back."
"right now, you mean?"
okay. secure the hoses - the lm hoses.
"no, we're taking - we're taking the pictures out of window 5, and that's where the scientific in- strument outlet is."
"okay, and i'm going to ac2 on telconn group - ac2."
the breaker open and the valve closed.
"yes. we wish we could send you a kit and it would be kind of like jutting a model airplane i together or something. as it turn_' f,_t,this contraption will look like a mailbo_ ,_hc_you get it a]l put together. 03 08 22 28 i_m-__ what do we make it out of, vance?"
...
okay. how about the - if i'm standing by with a blank page and just let you read me a new time line.
okay. we'll set them up.
"gordy, the zero-phase point now is off the coast of chile and ecuador - oh, maybe 10 or 15 degrees of longitude, and it is fairly dull. it does not seem to indicate any great amount of choppiness or wave action in that area."
roger. we're copying them.
we thank you. ed thanks you.
he does dress pretty well.
"okay; i'm looking down at mendeleev again, and - guess one of the things that i'm starting to notice is that - in this outer rim up here, we have a - a fairly smooth, cayley-like looking material. it's the same as what's down on the floor, then we have what looks like an old slump material. and on the outside of this smooth cayley that's at the top, looks like more smooth material. it's non- pitted, which means non-cayley. the margins of all this stuff are all very, very indistinct. just can't see anything. there's no flow fronts, there's -"
stand by.
yes.
there he is.
we copy. thank you.
"okay, guys, you want me to address first those to gene - those to jack, and then address them to gene later on, or you guys both want to answer them at the same time? lmp-i_ well, we're both listening. we can answer them."
"copy, 3.1."
"i was just thinking - i don't know why i didn't think of this before, but i bet you could get moonset on that thing. give a little burst as the moon goes down."

"(chuckle) i'm very well pleased, geneo. your - your language is superb. apollo 17 air-t0-ground voice transcription"
"outstanding. 42 degrees, pete."
"okay, houston. appreciate that. thank you, and we'll call you back."

... - -
what is your report on descent stage venting - was it venting? anytl_ing else going on? any more venting?
"16, houston. on that panel 382, in the manual control, the mixing valve, looks like we are going to have to play with that valve every time we change attitudes. so you might just leave that panel open or closed, for the two of the fasteners, so it will be easy to get into."
... pallet?
- - a little early.
"okay, go to it. day 5"
"no, we understand."

"- - relationship to that crater. man, there was practically no dust, just a little bit of a film; you had the ground, all the way to the ground."
"okay, yes, that'll be good."
"okay, you have it."
stow ops hose and actuator.
okay. we've got them.
beautiful picture.

"okay, karl. and we're looking okay up here. getting ready to do the gegenschein calibration."
roger.
look at this.
no.
"okay. we copy that, john. very good."
"copy that, fred."
"i want 001, huh?"
okay. i'm going to flip over one; i just want lpd to the right a little.

"okay. on 16, stab/control, aeld, closed."
"geno, don't change anything. we think it's a ground site situation here, and just stand by."
that would be a - that would be bad.
i changed my mind.
it's working.

okay.
where is that?
"the things that look like outcrops in the northern flow walls - got all these little fingers, these little white things that stick out there. and i don't know that i really see outcrops. 05 05 3_ 2d cmp oh! 05 05 3h hh cmp what i do see are the same old globs of material that cast shadows - that are just like the ones on the central peak. the dark material in there does seem to be mantling over the top of the white. there's no question in my mind about that. and it forms a lava - let's say it forms a pool, and the dark material does in fact lay right on top of that bright white stuff. well, let's see if we can look out to the north here and catch some more of that line of things that runs out of there. well, there's an interesting thing; let's see what that is. holy smokes! ahhhh! beautifull 05 05 35 3_ cml° that's frame 34, and that's on this big crater to the north of king, and it's a beautiful little crater wall in the side of this big crater, and it's got some black material that looks like it's just oozed out of the bottom of it. it's running right down the side. it's really something. the first - it's really dark material on really white sides. haven't seen anything like that anywhere up here so far. you see little splotches of material, but this is just really spectacular. this is not slumping - let me verify that i got the right setting on that. i sure don't want to mess that one up - f/ll, 1/250. time skip"
...
"bob, what i'm looking at is the - northwest portion of gatsby, where there's a very very concentrated block field on the inner wall, except where there are, on the southwest, three stream_ and on the northwest and north a continuous stream, if you will, on band, radial band, of mantle that is bur - appears to be burying that field, overlying and mantling the field. we got some pretty pic- tures of it, i think."
okay. i copy that.
"and, gene, as you get started there, we'd like a couple of rover battery temperatures; at least one. we know what theother one says. and, jack, we might get a frame count from you - oh, excuse me, we already got that; thank you, because it's changed."
you're right ... kicking too much.
make it okay?
yes.

- - i can walk as fast as you can drive.
"yes, there has been such a thing that i think you're referring to. i guess there's a more formal ver- sion coming that's supposed to be due out tomorrow morning, but there was a summary, fairly lengthy, on entire science, including the field geology, r which i'll try to dig up and maybe read to you if you wish. over."
"for all you nonbelievers, i verify he really is there."
thank you.
"let's go, al."
"cb sps pitch i and yaw l, open."

what's your plss 02 pressure gage?
it's only about 100 meters or so from us.
"we concur with that, buzz."

yes. may be a little messy.
"so we get where there's more - more frags down here, i think. 06 21 54 29 i_p-eva looks like they'll be large - too large down there."
that's what i've got. i'm watching for them to come up on the - on the horizon and see earthrise.
"okay, you're on the erectable antenna."
the point is my hands w_ll be much better off without them.
"okay, houston. go ahead with the earthshine pads."
several i thought were rocks turned out to be clods.
roger. we copy.
okay.
"okay. thank you, charlie."
"okay, jim. we're kind of watching this ptc a little bit. fred's been giving us a few lpd angles as we swang by the center of the earth - center of the moon. we noticed that the comm has been degrading just a little bit so you might have to talk up."
are you serious?
"now turn this - no, no, don't turn this damn thing over. just leave it right there. 5o lun i! bn/ia4., 5 04 13 20 47 _ 500 readout. coming up on, let's see how many degrees i'm off. oh, ... at your second?"

that's what i'm saying.
what comes up very shortly? check what out?
"we got enough right now - we got enough right now, but we didn't have the reserves for midcourse. we were within, say, 1 percent of running it out of gas. so - -"
"okay. you want to close the lm hatch, and i take it you want to install the command module hatch."
oki. both my gloves me verified locked. *** that gr_ you?
"yes, i read you, a1 - ed."

"okay, karl. we'll spin them up then."
"roger, 13. because of the 02 tank 2 quantity sensor drop out, eecom wants to keep a little closer track of the cryo quantities, and he's going to be asking you to stir all the cryo tanks at slightly more frequent intervals than had been planned, and the first time is now, and we will be calling you probably every 5 or 6 hours, ex- cept during sleep period and high activity periods. we'd like you to do it now. over. ) 02 03 07 hh cdr okay. we'll start it ... now. 02 03 07 _6 cc thank you."

"just like you called it, jim - - 06 00 26 24 i_mp-eva sure does, dave."
"okay, endeavour, houston. we're a minute and 20 seconds from los. your ascent capcom's going off duty, and i'll see you back on earth. it's been a lot of fun getting you up there."
to your left is that crater.
"did you copy that, don?"
"fantastic, that's a recordl"
i have to park about 045 because i've got to be pointing uphill so we can get out.
"that was premattlre. okay, i'm off the peg with the altimeter. ll 01 44 36 i24p okay."

"isn't that a good boy, al?"
"yes, i probably can."
okay; i'm going to bring yaw gimbal number 2 on.
wait for 30 seconds.
i can call joe when we up - unload that.

"okay. we copy, and you're spoiling my good record of two watches without saying anything."
"okay, charlie. i'm going to deploy this -"
"mark. flash in the right eye, right side."
*** help with that one?
"cabin pressure, close."

"copy. 07 09 21 bb cmp houston, 15."
"yes, there's two collec- -"
just a second. let me do a couple of things. do this ... take ... a little bit out of there.
"okay. well, we - okay. we passed - we are not close to any of them right now. we're in a very smooth area. we're in this - at 3._, at 190, we're down in this area where i've just described it. it goes into that big pit off to our - our west."

"okay, houston. i'm parked on a slope toward the - of about 10 degrees, or 5 or 6 or 7 degrees - toward the lunar module, and it's my guess that this will help your cooling some, because it's looking towards deep space - space a little, and i'm about 100 yards directly aft of the lunar module. is that where you want this contraption to be?"
"- - middle part of the page, it starts emergency powerdown, and we'll m_rk that up."

"yes. the water flag's clear, joe. oh, that feels so good. 06 04 23 00 imp-eva okay, i'm going for the rover tracks."
"glad you like it. okay, you're in sunlight, huh? yes, there he is."
"okay. aridpain camera to stereo - jack, ... help me get it. verify standby on stereo. okay, pan camera power coming on. 0ops, stand by here. okay. v over h, high altitude. 09 __ 31 59 cmp okay, p_ c_era to power. okay, got the power. okay, we've got a t-start coming up here at 24:07, 12 minutes .... suppose that's what it should be ... yes, ... let's see, houston, america. i only have one pan camera pad here. is that correct?"
dang right. where are - which way should we pitch to get to you?
"ro_er. 07 21 5-i0q c$_p there. 07 2] 51 50 chp .go ahead, flank."
"okay, we copy you, charlie. you've got a lot of hash in the background, but we can make do. it's about like yesterday. _"
"sounds fine, end i'm holding a tei-73 pad when you're ready for that."
"roger. ? 04 02 31 28 cc falcon, houston. bring up your steerable, please. see if that helps our comm."
"i guess in sim bay atti_ude, the only thing we have been able to see sc) far is sea of kovalsky, and _harlie said he got a view of it out his window. so i guess we've - just about now we're able to see the whole moon. boy, we're really movi:ag away fast."
"roger. morning, dave. waking you up an hour early because we've got a little problem on board we need addressed. when you get a moment to get something to write it down, let me talk to you about it in detail. the problem we're looking at is a leak in descent 02, and we're trying to determine whether we got a small cabin leak or a leak in the oxygen system itself. over."
"very good, charlie. you're right up to your old peak. 04 10 45 49 i24p-lm coming down on - okay, coming down, tony, on descent it looks - as john has described, there's a distinct ray pattern across our landing site from south ray, and the boulders get - effectively disappear by [sic] we get to palmetto. and then they don't reappear again until almost the flank of north ray. you can see that depression that trends southward out of north ray, and you can see / the ridge line that i think will be an excellent way to climb up to north way - ray in the rover. now this was all from 5000 feet, so i might be a little off on that, but at least the general impression was good. we could see dogleg, we could see cat; all of the craters that were on the stops were plainly visible. hopefully, they'll be so when we start navigating on the ground."
"i'll tell you what, i'm gonna put it up here just - i don't want to lose this one."
"is it hitting your neck at all? 0k 18 42 51 cdr no. the p-flag goes out, huh? 04 18 42 58 l_f°i yes. mine's out."
looks like the lock on this etb - i mean the lock on the lec is - jammed with -
you read me.
"and, falcon; houston. observe you're starting your ags load, i'd like to give you the pad be- fore you do that."
"houston, the problem, as you must know - it was 085 at 0.1 - is that such a reading puts us through a crater that's about 18, 20 feet deep, and it's too steep to climb in and out of."
okay; descent water going closed.
"okay. i'll turn around and start in. (laughter) rud-a-dub-dub. okay, you got my umbilical in sight?"
"okay, it's a lm impact tca and it's _ime is _'p0:35 a_d vhe camera data is cm5, el, 250, cex, _/_.6, z/lz_, infinity. _z_d magazine _ao_a kappa or kilo kilo, and you can use up lo i0 frames on it,. over."
"yeah, but that ain't 180. 06 03 53 21 _4p-eva okay; excuse me. (laughter) everywhere - i think you park in a crater - everywhere you go, there's a crater. i might as well just t_<e my chances. i'll take this. thank you. see that little hole you parked on there?"
"... pressure's coming down, though. pressure's coming down."
i've got it. cdr-_ an.d that's the landing site down there. we pitched right through the landing site.

okay.
you need two cross-sun and one down-sun.
roger; you got it. po0 and accept.
_at's affirmative.
"i guess there won't be any need to go back and change the checklist on that, but there's a lot to be said for maybe going to a real good stable condition and then getting a good firm checkout before you go into that downvoice backup mode and things like that. and i think that's what we'll do in the future."
but i don't see a track.
okay.
"time to open up the lrl doors, charlie."
roger; go ahead.
"okay, jim. your present configuration has the following features. we got the electrical buses cross tied through the bal idad circuit breakers, and we have a[_o cabin repress. one thing we'd ]]ke to do right now is to giw, you an uplink, so immediately we have to, on p_]e2 11, close the updata link circuit bre_er. go to po0 and data. over."

okay. di_ you give them the bag number?
"- - at your tracks, could you tell when you picked up the softer regolith? on the tracks that you came out? 07 01 02 06 imp-eva they've all looked the same. haven't they to you, john ?"
"okay, i ran out of film, too."
"oh, that's right. yeah."
... 06 04 16 15 cmp
it doesn't look too cold. looks pretty good.
roger. just a reminder on that. and eecom is over here trying to figure out if you changed the canister or not. just a reminder on that one.
"... the old purge valve, valve 208. it came from the taurus-littrow landing area of the moon. okay. got the purge valve. boy. okay, just looking at some ... (laughter) okay. it's low, is it?"
"hello, houston."
"okay. the good fido gives us a vacuum perigee at the present time of 23.6 with a flight path angle of minus 6.25 degrees. that's without a midcourse. he's kind of tossing around the idea of doing a midcourse-7 maneuver at 5 hours before entry. if we do it, it looks like it won't be more than 2 feet per second. over."
"okay, there's a maneuver to p52 high-gain attitude. fdoi [sic] trim required; roll, pitch, and yaw. well, beautiful, they didn't give us that one. did they? did they give us an attitude to go to, jim - after the burn?"
okay.
"houston, america. we've got the pgas in the bag. (laughter) hope that's right."
"as a matter of fact, it just doesn't look like (tranq) it sunk in at all. 04 09 46 -- begin lunar rev 16"

stand by. it looks on the map - -
go.
"loud and clear, jack."

okay.
"roger. seeing you coming. 05 02 24 13 i2_p-eva what's the - what's the heart rate when i'm going like this, tony?"
"... go bong, bong - -"
"okay, what you want to set on here? it's reading 65 now. we're supposed to purge to what, 49? 09 23 57 57 cml° forty-nine. so that's only 15 percent."

"in fact, we ought to be - rhysling ought to be off to our right."

ail right.
109:59:59:94.
"okay_ here. i was just looking at the wright brothers [?] crater as we were going through there again_ _md the outer - crater rims on that _,_._ are kind of like the one - ... about rev 62 in the picture_ but the outer rim - is sloping in vhe opposite direction from the normal cra_er, or something_ in other words, the steep slope is on the outside of the rim, and you have a gradual slope up vo the - you _ow, from the censer of the crater, you've got a gradual slope up to tho rim, and then it _ops off _o tee steep slope on mhe ouvside. _md the steep slope on the ouvside is maybe - oh, 35 _o _5 degrees. the slope on _he inside is _roba,biy - somewhere aro_a 20 degrees z _zouid guess. _aa _kere is one porvlon of _ke r_m - _l_m _ on the western _orvzon of z_he one _kaz z was lookzng av_ _ayhow - im's almosm a delta-shapes ring."
"i really don't think this camera's pointed right, ron. it's boresightea right down - looks like the junction between ptolemaeus and alphonsus. but, anyway, my - both targets a and b - had no trouble acquiring these and no trouble sticking with them. even a is the - the hardest; it's not quite as straight. now b had a - had a bright rim and showed up at the very start of the - of the obser- vation. a is - is a little more subdued, but it was quite easy to pick up and hang on to. and that's - that's really a no-sweat on - on this one, much - much easier than the - those on the back- side. in fact, i rated some of those with zero. and i'd have to give them up on - on both these targets - cone crater."
...?
"okay. we don't need the floodlights, i don't think, but we can do it that way, i guess."
deep?

okay. cabin gas return to egress; verify.
"but, maybe there's just about eight or 10 bubbles in it. 01 21 52 36 _p that's three turns. the fluid is essentially ... and we're still going on the first - fourth, so for turn now, and it's still develops a meniscus around the lower baffle - the smaller baffle."
"that clip got away. come towards - me, in the cabin - there."
"right. just wanted to verify - we had poor reception when i was talking to you before - i wanted to verify that you understand that the sun check you made earlier in the a0t was good, and that's what we're riding on. anything that we told you in the past about looking at the sun in the front left window or looking at stars, like nunki through the aot, why, we want to forget."
what is the present get? over.

"okay. i think the big one is too big to put in, as usual. of course, we'll never be satisfied with that, but i'll take some of these others."
"okay, both dqe& and the other switch."
"okay. how about that - the pse - the passive seismic cable. is it tight? what we have to de- cide here is - if you move the central station, will it disturb the pse? that thing is uncaged now and you can't recage it. so we can't afford to move it. 05 19 29 58 i_p-lm well, he said it's - he thinks it's pretty tight, john does, but i can't remember. how far do you want to move it?"

"okay, joe. the time consumer here is the seatbelt operation. because we definitely need them, and in 1/6g, we don't compress the suits enough to - be able to squish down and get the seatbelt locked without a certain amount of effort."
"well, we could wrap them in tissue."
"okay, i'll do a hatch integrity check then. 04 03 bi 40 cdr okay."
"probably cught to start a verb 49 maneuver. ,53 15 49 55 cdr okay. now we can do."

let's try reacq and wide. and you won't try to step to narrow. we won't try to step to narrow. 09 06 34 20 i_mp okay; the pitch is osch - oscillating right now between about plus - minus 10 and minus 40. tape145/5
"that's correct, j_m. and, 13, houston. the computer is yours."
"roger. cdr-i_4 oh, doesn't that feel good. whool"
roger. but your heading is beautiful. continue on.
"plus 0131.0, 310. you got that. that's it. it ought to give you about a 1_7 by 13, roughly."
got it.
"roger. and what was the relative sequence on selecting water separator number 2 and the secondary c02 canister; that is, did you go to the secondary water separator first and then the secondary c027 over."
"say, fred, did you get the dope on the saturn _v impact - s-ivb impact?"
you never got the other one changed?
okay. i understand. standing by.
"jack, the big one's out of the way. what we really had to get out there on. boy, look at that visor. no wonder i couldn't see."
"and we need the suit circuit relief valve back to auto. correctson, back to close."
yes - -

"now where did i put my flight - yes, sir, we are in attitude and- -"
okay.
got a place for that?
good; i forgot. i got interested in skiing. whoo! can't keep my edges. little hard to get a good hip rotation.
"now there's some indications, to me at any rate, that the jetstream in that area may be essentially east-west - oh, maybe 20 degrees of latitude north of the ross sea, and then bends down very sharply so that it intersects the - or approaches the coa - antarctic ice shelf to the east of the ross sea, and then maybe it bends up and forms the axis that i just described that's causing that bending of the cloud patterns."
"okay, we're - oh - let_ me - which batter'j?"
"roger. 56978, clear 231; plus 5697_, enter. 40'#'5h97 _ enter. okay, fred; they are in"

"bob, we got a go to start our dumps?"
i'll try to do it....
"go ahead, jack."
"here's some goodies, i guess. better? ..."
okay.

"yes, sir. here comes your flow off, now."
"okay, 00, 176, 0."
"direct 1, ?,_ina/mai.'ib; direct 2, main a/main b."
"okay. i believe it was about 20 g_mmas less, something like that 110 gammas."
let me take - why don't we configure our helmets and gloves off?
and we got the time base fix indication on time.
main a/main b.
- - maybe you can put these - -
"okay, we're right with you. okay, we'll go ahead from there with the checklist."
"well let's see, jack. they kind of - let me turn back here. they actually included - when they mentioned the negative anomaly of minus 30 milli- gals at the base of the north massif. they said stations 6 and 8, parenthetically there. so evidently they're including the whole area there as the negative anomaly. i'll try to get a more amplified answer to your question. _i° now, could you see if you can verify with them that they were unable to - or there was no dis- tinction between the measurements of the sculptured hills and the north massif? _ yes. l'ii - i'll work on that."
"okay, thank you."
"stand by, al."
i think you'd better.
yes.
roger. go ahead.
"okay. now we'll do a verb 48 enter. verb 21 enter. ll001 enter. pro, pro, pro. verb 25 noun 7 enter; i enter; 0 enter."
that's affirm; t08 and 102.
then do a verb 64 to get -
that's the order of the day.
"naw, the visibility gets pretty good at high sun angles."
you toc; you too.
ought to get there in a hurry. 04 01 02 49 i_mp yeah. you want me to do a verb 49?
"vox - max. vhf to t/r; b to receive. okay. cb(16) comm: se audio, open, and you connect to the - plss comm."
"roger, jim. thank you."
"wait, wait, let me write that down."
roger. pitch is minus 23 and yaw is plus 171. over.
okay. we got the next milestone. we're counting down to pdi.
wait a minute; i'll hold that down. 05 13 31 11 lm_ there you go. tip it - push - push your rcu down a little bit more.
"okay, whst it is, is we've loss %ne reaz--w.e: drive."
camera on?
that sounds good.
"ah - roger, do you want to read back what we had there for 168:057"
okay.
plss fan is off; pump's off.
roger. 108:56:58; 109:21:38; 109:43:04.
i'm sure of that.
"oh, roger. map camera, on,on t-start, and scratch the map camera, on to standby. _ 08 20 36 14 cc roger. that takes care of ali the - ail the updates required for the next rev."
and it's got that sugary texture to it.
"yes, i'm just about ready, bob."
"al, what all is there?"
"13, houston. did you copy our powerdown request?"
i don't think i will. it'd be too easy to puncture them.
roger. we can confirm that.
no.
"okay, we want red to red and blue to blue. we got to verify these two because -"
"you know, after we can dump it again."
"okay. delta-vcg is in csm. gimbal drive, pitch and yaw is in auto. standing by for the bus ties."
"okay, dsk_ blank - average g's on."
"okay. okay, before you go back - i got to go down after a picture here. and i want to get a pan of this thing. we can get a stereo pan - as you start your radial sample."
okay.
thank you.
cc_ing over the hawaiian islands.
tell them when you get back.
okay. i'll use the meters.
roger. we concur.
"okay, houston. are your high gain angles for the sextant photos or forthe lunar-eclipse-photo attitude?"
"let me tell you, this night launch is something to behold."
"..., jack."
"okay, bob. we're going to work up an appetite with the alfmed today."
the radar has come out and i'm in radar test now.
i'm not sure how we - i'm not sure how we prove it. we didn't have time to prove it.
"roger. and then over on the other side of the page at 84:40, again terminator photos. the first one, the first line there, 84:40 will now read ""el, on,"" and the time will be ""t-start minus 1:40,"" 1:40."
"roger. we concur on that. and i'll read this back to you a little more slowly, fred."
"okay, bag 349."
okay; very good.
no ....
"yes, bob."

"tranquility. roger. we copy. stand by 1. and, break, break, columbia. we're having a little trouble getting the stuff in there. request high gain, pitch minus 20, yaw plus 150. over."
"if you can get it on, fine; if not, don't worry about it."
okay.
okay.
"okay. plss pump, #**; that's to the right. pres- sure regs a and b, egress."
roger. good show.
i'm headed to the right-hand edge of the head crater.
"you don't have any flags, charlie."

it's in the - it's in the purse.
"okay, if they are, cb descent eca and descent eca control, chert. 07 03 22 _1 lmp okays mine are both open."
"okay. let us talk it over for a minute, jack. 04 15 17 16 cml? okay. real fine. and while you guys are talk- ing it over, you might read back - rave you got the procedure for rev,}rsing this? i'll copy that. 04 15 20 o0 civ>il okay, jack. are you with me?"
going omni bravo now.
i wouldn't - i wouldn't whistle around the block for it. especially after i had so much trouble with that bag.
"roger, jim - - ! 06 20 56 02 izmp-eva pretty rough on the one you're seeing now. we'll walk - -"
and the cover is closed.
i think itm gonna sit down and think some more about that td&e.
"bob, i'm not very happy with this level. but i'll turn it on and - have me come back a little bit later, when they've warmed up some more, and let's see what it looks like."
yes.
okay.
did you get your soil there? 06 01 26 15 i_p-eva do what? huh? say again.
okay; all set.
"okay, what they're saying is, i don't need my hammer any more."
that's strange.
"okay. okay, *** retrieve purge valve."
you got a good watch.
close now.
"okay. actually worked, tony. it came off."
"close. okay, ... 3, 4 -"
"aquarius, houston. radio check."
try another couple swaths here - -
okay. it's coming on now.
... now?
roger; copy.
"charlie, how does this look - how does this look for the antenna point?"
"- - for a neutron flux, huh? lmp-_ya yes, sir; and the core."
"roger, jim. we didn't just suddenly lose that. that was telmu's understanding of how we wanted the consumables updated. we're having a dis- cussion about that right now. that was meant to be what your reading on board should be. i guess, saying that if you're reading 58 percent, you're in good shape. whereas, there's a sepa- rate figure, which is a figure down here, which i guess is something like the 70 percent that i gave you a few minutes ago. that seems to be a - -"
it doesn't look like - the - the real basalt.
"yes, that does sound a little better."
"it is out, houston."
"go ahead. 04 05 59 _8 cc okay, we want on panel ]2, track mode switch, off; on panel 16, primary transmitter/receiver circuit breaker, open; s-band antenna heater circuit breaker, open; s-band antenna comm circuit breaker, open; and primary s-band power amplifier, open. then on panel 11, ac bus s-band antenna, open. over."
"i hope we go a lot further on. 04 14 09 21 _p we do; we got a long ways to go. got a - hundreds of miles after pdi, for christ's sake. already, we have 170 by 260 something - -"
"oh, you won't believe it."
i will.
"- - if it's easy to do just keep bag - bag 2 under the seat mad follow your checklist normally. bag 2 is just an extra bag for us. 06 19 46 46 l_p-eva we still have some tools in bag 2, dave. i'll just leave that bag there and put bag - our last collection bag under my seat."
yes.
"go ahead, gordo. we're ready to copy."
"oh, yes, you can dump it. i had to take the pallet out to get the tcu off."
okay 90.
"okay, we copied 10 degrees. is that earth or moon, jim?"
roger. it looks like i'm losing comm with orion. could you ask them to go back to a simplex?
"eagle, this is houston. are you calling? over. 04 00 22 08 lmi° roger. how do you read? over."
"cb(16), comm, tv, closed. 04 23 37 26 lmp-i_ comm, tv, closed."
"say, houston; falcon. by the way, the vhf is crystal clear up here. our comm is working great. soon as you guys get it squared away on the ground, i guess we'll all be tied together."
okay.
roger. copy. tape l&0/ll
is there still stuff coming out of our dump?
"well, i don't see any way around it, jim. it sure doesn't seem to be doing much, does it? it won't go down."
you stand there and take a break. 06 01 13 12 i_p-eva i'm taking one.
floods and all that good stuff.
"okay, we can go to - let me just make sure i got the same target."
okay.
"six degrees, there you go."
"okay, ed. do you want those pipa biases loaded now?"
"okay, we're counting."

"put track mode to reacq and narrow beam. 09 11 23 _5 _ okay; you've got reacq, narrow beam, and high gain selected."

okay.
"what - oh, yes - -"
*** the transmitter - but you've got to come out here anyway.
"let me check and see. cml° (laughter) yes, i've got to find the subsolar point. a little bit of an error looks like. let me see, we'll fix it down a little bit. that really jars us back, doesn't it?"
ysu want it in bypass? £ [-...
"okay. now shove it. that's too much. wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. let me - okay. let me lift it up and do it. well, wait a minute, i've got to tweak this thing. okay, now shove it in. right now."
"okay. let's take the throttle up at 26,"
"stand by, dave. tape 76_4"
"okay, ron, the effective horizon was 25, plus or minus 6 nautical miles, which is real fine. the substellar pointing error was 1 arc-minute, plus or minus 1 arc-minute, which is less than the i-sigma error. the marking data was extremely consistent, and all techniques and procedures were excellent. and the horizon updates from the current onboard value of 28 - is not required, so you're extremely good p23. outstanding. _ hey, that's good to hear. great. thank you."
"okay, houston. the crew status report ,[s8-1/2, 7, and 8."
"and this is a kilogrsm soil locations, fellows."
"okay. 000.44, 104.63, 359.69."
"roger. 05 t2 28 45 cdr okay, houston. i'm locking for a contact somewhere in here, but it's not apparent at this point. sur- face texture seems to be very much the same; *** the standpoint of *** bearing properties, it's still about the same softness; and it still has the same raindrop pattern."
"can you squat down any further, because you're hooked on - you're making it worse. okay."
"okay; 3, 2, i -"
"well, it self-checked okay. i don't show anything on the agc yet. power's on. it should work."
"okay. 07 03 07 10 lm_-lm man, that's a big rock right there. that thing's big."
"roger. got about three short items and a sim bay status, if you're ready."
"there's 5, 6 -"
fantastic!
"roger. could you tell us, please, the status of the pan camera switch?"
...
- - should be shutdown.
let's get this thing in - -
okay. we got that.
roger. 47.2 by 9.5. (goss net 1) tape 80/9
(hl_mmlng) okay; ready to copy.
"one other question, jim. our readings down here say your lm cabin's about as cold as the command module cabin. is that right?"
"- - the dbky, if you will1. i2,pi say goodnight, bob."
i'll do it. okay. what'd you have to do - -
they are ...
better tell them where we are.
"hello. how'd everything go on the back? 05 23 25 48 cml° oh, we got a lot of very dim photographs."
"there, i - you're in good shape."
okay.
"oh, yes."
"now the evasive burn is complete, now."
"roger. standby on that, geno; and we'll be with you in a minute."
"oh, yes. and that's a north-south trending, isn't it?"
"okay, our next breaking gate is at 3000 feet."
roger.
"ron, houston. the answer to your q_estion is yes. mag delta delta is the one."
we show minus 8-1/2 minutes.
youtre right.
is it taking in?
... jtdnfidenti
i'd guess about three.
"yes. (laughter) joe, he's - jim's reading you okay. so it must be connected."
i'm sorry; i didn't copy that.
"plenty good enough. i got to start heading right out here, right toward my - upper graphic - -"
affirmative.
okay.
"the wall is fine, yet very cohesive."
yes .... a little bit. i got a ...
"well, let me get a piece of this glass."
let me throw the hammer.
take a picture and let's see.
"and, fred, we would like to have you verify fuel _ell reactants talkback is barber pole."
roger. understand two gray. cy2 circuit breaker is open. two gray_ that's affirm.
"ok_ky. from our point of view, you only got a little more than half an earth."
did you get my bag already?
"go get the - look at this black rock, here."
"roger. that's correct, and we'll go ahead and watch tank 2. if it doesn't - tank 2 doesn't decrease, we'll tell you to close the ascent feeds and open the shutoffs. over."
... fell over.
you want to go to - you want to get that - open then auto at 3.5. okay; go ahead.
"we'll even have a 12-string guitar for you, jimbo."
"yes. yes, i couldn't believe it when i saw that thing. thought i was back in floody's simulator."

yeah.
okay.
"you're on the 30-second mark, and i'm on the minute mark."
"orion, will you go forward omni? 07 09 16 23 cm_ - - it looks like the - the - 07 09 ]6 36 cmp looks like some of the thermal blanket aro_!d the ecas on the back end there is pretty badly chewed up."
... i can reach it. i got it; i can reach it.
okay; here's the covers. 07 22 12 55 _ ... any target we pick out?
okay. pre is 75 and post is 111.
"orion, this is houston. you can expect a roll moment offset due to the tg [?] change. we've had a loss of rcs system a. and then at 500 feet to go, when you open the main shutoff valve, yo_ can expect an rcs warning at that time; otherwise, it'll be nominal procedures during ascent."
go ahead.
roger. mighty fine; thank you.
d_mnx do i have a lot of breakfast here ....
"okay, here we go. prop temp/press monitor, descent i - - 04 00 b0 2b cdr 1. 04 00 b0 24 lmp - - descent. 04 o0 bo 25 cdr yeah, i checked all that, charlie."
"okay, bob. *** and station 3, and station 2, s_d what else."
it's a lit - little easier today.
"in moscow, space engineer anatol koritsky was quoted by tass as saying that luna 15 could accomplish everything that has been done by earlier luna spacecraft. this was taken by the press to mean luna 15 could investigate the gravitational fields, photograph the moon, and go down to the surface to scoop up a bit for analysis."
"15, this is houston."
no good way to get to that ...
okay. how's that look? ... ought to get to i_.
"i'm in mine, aren't i? 04 13 02 51 _p yes. you better be, hadn't you? okay, where's that camera supposed to be set up for pdi? that's going to make me mad_ i think it's supposed to be 12 frames a second."
okay. i'll go to the ssr page. do you want me to go through that whole smash for fuel cell shut- down? is that correct?
"hey, i doubt if we can get the star sextant check, but you can try it."
roger; stand by a minute.
"yes. 05 10 48 2& hmp get, all the stuff up. get that?"
"okay, that's right - i'm sorry, i forgot about that."

"we'd like another confirmation, when we closed the tunnel vent valve back to lm/cm delta-p, we were reading about 1.7 - 1.75, and it slowly went up now to about - oh, i'd say a little less than 2.2. seems to be holding there - is there a lag in the gaging system?"
go ahead; try it.
"joe, jim's awake here. ready to listen."
"decided to play it anyway, because it's such a - such a pretty selection."
"that' s right. cdr-i_m gordo, this is spectacular. it is absolutely spectacular looking at that command module, america, down there coming across the surface. we're just tracking him at about a b0-degree dive angle."
"yes, sir."
"that's 10,000 pictures of horizons and sunrises. i got a picture of the moon out there .... coming up."

"okay, bob, this is gene. i had a - just a quick view of the site, and if we're anywhere near it, we'll recognize it, i think, without question. and, i think with that, we'll bid farewell and good night."
right.
good line. it's on. because that line is open.
forget it. we got it. i - i was left out.
"roger. the laser altimeter, off. and the map camera/laser covers, closed."

"or rather, houston. jim, it looks like we got a loekon, which is going to improve our data flow here. only thing is, we'll probably lose data and probably voice, too, during a portion of each roll. so you might expect that. the other thing is, if anyone has on any biomed, would you switch your switch to - your biomed switch to that position."
"yes, sir."
"okay, houston. this is the lmp with 93 percent, 93 percent."

"okay; urine line heater's going to come off, and the breaker is out. okay."
roger. that'll be bravo if you change yours here. you could change it at station 10.
roger.
"when i first saw that on apollo 10, i thought i was in 2001. i couldn't figure out what was happening, because the - the guys i was tracking were up above me at the time, for some reason."
roger. don't mess with it.

"that's correct. and turning over a page to 5-5, you have an addition underneath the normal step which reads, ""circuit breaker sps pitch i and yaw 1 to open."" your addition reads, ""circuit breaker .sps pilot valve, main b, open."" and we have still another step to add in there, which is, ""circuit breaker ems, two of them, main a and main b, to open."" and, also, we would like to delete, one step below that, the three lines ""map camera, on, to off,"" ""pan camera power to off,"" and ""sm/ac power to off."" over."
no. i didn't; i didn't. doubt if it changed much since i called you.

how about that?
"jack, i don't know if it's significant news, but at least i know you will be interested. both your demand regs look good now. we show no evi- dence of a lesk there and it may have been that just recycling them reseated them and solved what- ever problem we had. you can go ahead with the 02 recharge on the plss and the water recharge at your convenience. and let me poll the room here for other news items. over. _ 06 04 08 21 cdr-lm okay, joe, we're starting an 02 charge of the cdr's plss, l0 minutes."

what 's cabin now?
"yes, green cast to the rocks. to the big blocks, you know, that are laying around there - around the crater and also the ones that are down - down in the bottom."

"okay. with the sextant photo test here, we have a call for a pcm cable, and the only ones we have on board will not reach the connectors over by the right-hand girth shelf. do you have any sug- gestions on how we can get the dac connected to the pcm?"
"okay, houston; aquarius. how do you read?"
"yes, sir. i'm reading you 5 by 5."

good work.
the restraints in here do a pretty good job of pulling my pants down.
"everything is just twice as hard. i_mp-lm now comes the old hay fever, again. that went up and that went down."
"okay, houston. i'm going to pick up a s_mple which i think is a black-type rock, but it's sort of dust covered."
"i wanted to surprise you. they're going in all the way, and they're both going to work. it's a little tough looking into the sun."
okay. good show.
"can you hear us, dick?"
roger. that's where we are. still pulling 3g's.
"there's a pretty one over there, without ar.y dust on it at all. out about 50 meters, by those v_ee little craters."
"jerry, this is jack. thanks a lot, boy."
"as a matter of fact, i'm going to stop right here and take a little break."
"yes, let's get that. that's a good idea. ail the rocks we've been looking at, houston, in this area, seem to be the same. they seem to have a - the rock has got dirt built up on all sides of it, all directions."
"we're go for cmc cut-off. okay, ed, counting down to zero."
"pan camera power, off."
"yes, hut he didn't ru_lin the dust, so i guess we'll have to give it a trial run."

"these windows are all fogged up; when we - when we come on with power, we're going to have to come on with the window heaters."
"dick, you couldn't look out the aot and - and see this thing. hell, i can see the stars in broad daylight with the cockpit light up. there it is."
"jack, we're just about to switch antennas now. why don't you wait until we get through it before continuing."
"okay. go to 248 hours, on the next page, and in the note coll-,n, change the dap load status to _- read 11101. and the rest is the same. and this dap load status continues through the ptc until 251 hours. and the next change is at 251 hours and 4 minutes."
"if it's in your pocket, that might account for it."
"just a little bit better, but you're still - -"
okay. i'm going to power up and see if i can't come down and get you.
"roger. stand by, 15."

"pcm bit rate, low."

"glad to hear your voice down there, boss - admiral."
roger. we see the particles and - great picture!
i want to get around here and get a burn report off.
roger - -

"we heard that one at station 7 - yes, 7, wasn't it?"
"america, houston. one other request you might be thinking about that you'd - and that is any delta to the nominal entry stowage that we might not know about we'd like to know about before you go to sleep tonight so we can think about the c.g."
that's falling off a little bit. see?
okay.

"okay, you're loud and clear to me; and, houston, hew do you read the cdr?"
you can't do anything more than that.
"yeah, charlie. we want you to - -"

copy that.
"and, ron, you might be getting - _ey're making a vhf check right while you're doing the landmark tracking. c_ okay."
forget it. next thing is comm activation.
"charlie, when you get a minute there, we got a couple of questions. 05 02 10 oh cdr-eva okay."
yes. as long as you're careihl1 not to hit the button while you're doing it.
"oh, i can't see squat in the telescope. hey, there it is."
"okay, copy that - -"
i was going to say as long as you're - -

"well, that makes up for it."
oh.

"okay, go."
(sneeze)
just look at the s-band antenna and look up that way; it's right up there.
okay.
"roger. we're looking _ttlm current, to see if jack has started his preheat, and we haven't seen it yet. is he doing okay down there?"
"it - well, i think - at least we're going to see where the break in slope is for the rim. ,v_f goodness."
we copy. sounds like a good idea.
"casper, houston. about a minute to go for your uv."
"okay, it sounds like you're probably just driving by the east trident or trident 3."
"sure, mike. that's fine. we'll get it to you then. (goss net 1) tape 83/5"
roger. there just doesn't seem to be any slow way to get the repress closed to auto and avoid a big bang. over.
copy that.
we'll take a look. stand by. give us your best guess on how long ago it was.
the thing wouldn't stay on a minute ago; now it won't come off.

"go ahead, america."
"i'll try to talk about as much as i do in the doggone simulator. if it looks like the gas is good, i'll say it; if it looks like we're too high or something, i'll say it, but i don't - -"

"yes, something's not right the way i - there. okay, that did it."
"apollo 15, apollo 15, go."
"16, at 8 minutes. looking good here."
"funny thing, hank. as soon as i hit enter, they pulse out and it looks like they go where they belong, and then as soon as it comes back, it just goes out and comes right back."
...
"roger, jack."
"oh, gosh."

"and i'm looking through the aot there, jack, and the sun's right in the top and it's about maybe 2 degrees to the right of the cursor. so that looks real good."
yes.

roger. fine. we copy.
"now it's coming back out again. 04 15 26 h6 c'_pe okays b. you just almost lose b going tc zero- phase. i can tell where it is by the o_her craters - pointing at it. but, if you didn't have that help, it'd be tough. 04 15 27 12 cmip and now we're going into - a's goin_ in toward zero-yhase. in fact, i'm quite surprisea how washed out they do become. i had anticipaae_ i would be able to stay with them a little more than that."
"okay, skipper; 14 degrees. thank you."
"okay houston, we're just about to start with the - with the sim bay turnoff here on page 3-6, and we'll do those additions that you talked about."
okay. sounds like you guys have been working again.
"endeavour, please terminate battery bravo charge."

roger. just in time.
"and, vance, we're counting down to midcourse-2, we're up to, in our checklist, to minus' 6 minutes to go."
"roger, copy."
"okay. we'll put down that you're starting up at 101:46. oh 05 05 12 l_? i'll give you a little room there, stuart, and i'll come right over ..."
okay.
"bob, it looks like the glass is fairly light colored. it's not white. well, no - it's black. it's anorthositic gabbro, rather than gabbroic anorthosite, i think. yes, that's black glass in the pits."
come up. there you go.
"but you know what? i believe, just like the - you know, i think that the general attitude that we have seen, a one-in-a-million glitch, is prob- ably quite correct."

"houston, apollo 16. 08 oi 41 19 cc gc,ahead. apollo 16, houston. go ahead."

okay. i'll give you a hack on it.
dedicating my imagination to science.
yes.
"and i lost them all - so on that one, at the switch point, i could not pick up target a at all. et was just too subdued. b was easy to pick up, and c also. c - c was - was very easy to pick up. going through zero-phase, b was completely wiped out; a, i never did have to start with, so it was wiped out; and c - c held through zero-phase and reason- ably well; but as it got further on up, it, too, got pretty well wiped out. i think it's the same bit of being on the - being on the backside. you just - the terrain is - you don't have the flat mare surface to give you the relief that - that you need to pick out - to pick out the targets. it's - what - very little contrast in albedo, and - you - you just don't have the - the ability _o see the darks and lights like we did on the frontside pass yesterday. and, i guess, in summary now, for targets 3 - very easy to pick up at the time i picked them up; of course, the sun was low an them. and i'm going to turn off this ... test lever under panel 18. okay, i'll leave it on a little longer and debrief onto the tape. a - a, b, _nd ccn target 3 picked up very easily. saw them into zero-phase; surpri - b is a fairly shallow crater, but it even held up as good as c. i'd out b _u_ c both completely wiped out at zero-phase. a held to zero-phase; but then, as it went on up, you surely couldn't have picked it up - by itself, if you didn't know the relation to some other terrain. all three of those were - once you're well past zero-phase, it'd be a rather marginal target. and, on target 6, i never got a at all - it was already wiped out. b went real fast in zero-phase approach. c, you could still identify after zero-phase, but just because you knew it was there, knd then, i% got pretty well wiped out as it - as it went or:up."
"at 30 seconds, i'll get the engine arm; and we'll watch the pgns tapemeter pick up average g. if you give me a go on the ullage, i'll back up the ullage. lmp-lm. okay."
"okay; you're at 510 feet, 2 feet a second·"
secs - secs arm breakers are open.
"*** flag, o; and 02 - -"

"houston, apollo 15."
is it? ...
"okay. i can grab them like this. okay. okay, now. have you got clock counting up or down or something?"
"yes, sir."
okay.
"yes, and it's ... like everything. hey, we got to decide what we going to do with that plaque."
"apollo 15, this is houston. good morning. apollo 15, this is houston with a message from richard strauss, arthur c. clarke, and stanley kubrick. 08 19 25 17 music - (theme from ""2001: a space odyssey"")"

"okay, first of all the weather. it's raining fairly - fairly heavily all night; there's a lot of water standing around. temperatures here are in the high 50's, but it's supposed to get a little cooler tonight with a low in the 40's. i think you know how the dallas-redskin game came out - the only thing additional mentioned here is that chances look good now that washington and dallas may meet in the rubber games for the national conference representative in the superbowl. in the other pro game yesterday, a field goal by don cockroft was the difference in a 26-to-24 win by cleveland over rival cincinnati. other sports highlights: the pittsburgh steelers play the oilers today in the dome. other big games will be atlanta at san francisco, green bay at minnesota, and baltimore at kansas city. tennessee state beat drake uni- versity in the pioneer bowl 29 to 7. and east texas state beat carson newman in the naia football playoffs. the southwest conference has pulled out of the u.s. olympic committee. some college basketball scores: the houston cougars routed xavier last night out at hofheinz pavilion ll4 to 7b; and rice downed george washington 93 to 89. geno, you'll be glad to hear purdue ripped tcu 101 to 70, and it was texas over oklahoma state 86 to 66. and smu over oklahoma city 106 to 8b. we couldn't find any score at cal tech, jack, but - switch to omni bravo, please. but one final score, ron, kansas lost to iowa 69 to 56. the only thing new on the plane crash friday in chicago - it's reported here that the plane was apparently waved off because another plane was still on the assigned _ runway. the democratic party's stormy session in washington saw the old-guard democrats appar- ently take back control of the party from pro- mcgovern forces. mrs. jean westwood was replaced as party chairman by texas lawyer/businessman robert strauss. former-president t_mau appears to be more than holding his own at a hospital in kansas city. there's a good chance the 88-year- old former chief executive may be taken off the critical list. there's been a 1-day interruption in the secret peace talks between dr. henry kissinger and le duc tho. the two conferred for over 3 hours yesterday. both sides have agreed not to talk to newsmen on any s_stantive matters. in other news highlights, president nixon has named daniel moynihan as u.s. ambata -ambassador to india. and chilean president allende has flown to cuba to vis - to visit fidel castro. here's an interesting one. a 45-year-old pilot lost in the arctic for 31 days has been found alive and well. three companions were killed. the soviet party boss leonid breshnev has delayed a scheduled visit to the u.s. it looks as if the visit may come in the fall rather than this coming spring. one last note: the news media says that the flight of apollo 17 is the smoothest on record so far, and i call that last one pretty accurate reporting. over."
"okay, just so we got it straight aft engine cover, bag 8. left hand side, bag 7. left hand plus the right hand side; number 6 left hand and 5 right. and the isa bags 2 and 4."
"okay, and, 17, what we're looking for is deploying charge number 082 and 0.4 on the range."
i had a subtle reminder.
"okay, going to free."
okay. i'll have to give you another one here in a minute.
"oh, just me (laughter)."
okay.
they're off.
"well, we're just trying to figure out who's; likely to be the most tired up there. you or jim."
"hey, bob, just ignore everything he said. we'll leave him a pair of our scissors, and he's just worried about being hungry."
"don't see any counts, do you?"
"okay, casper. we recommend you go b/d roll, and that winds it up."
"roger, gene. you're looking great."
"ecs suit fan 1, closed."

"houston, aquarius."
okay.

okay. got three marks.
"that's where all that dust came in from yesterday, was - yours is closed."
"okay, it's going closed."
the right solution is the fact that you've got a man here doing it.
"okay. yours is in, but mine is not. l_-eva well - neither's my outboard one."
yes.
"roger. cml° well, you know peirce charlie looks like - the sides of the south massif, almost. look down in that. in other words, it is kind of highly eroded, elongate crater. cml° ... are all vertical; you know, i don't - i don't - vertical is the only way i know how to describe them. they point toward the - you know, radial - they point radial, but they all point toward the middle of the crater."
"purge valve and ops 02 hose, stow purge valves in tsb."
"it's rev 3, isn't it?"

"you want the sm/ac power, on, and the self test switch to heaters?"
"okay. okay, joe. i'm parked, and i'm a little - i'm going to be looking up-sun. i can't seem to get it. sure need that steerage. f-"
sounds to me like you fellows are going to have your rock quota.
0.5. 0.3. you got it at what - about 0.2 yesterday?
"okay; that'll hack it. let me go to auto here. need my checklist. make it - oops, that's closed. that's auto, and the lock ... is on? okay? hatch is open all the way. where are _e?"
"17, why don't we get that scoop sample as the first sample of jack's radial sample, 177"

"roger. 04 11 00 32 cdr-seva and - all of the - all of the features around here are very smooth. the tops of the mountains are rounded off. there are no sharp jagged peaks or no large boulders apparent anywhere. the whole surface of - the area appears to be smooth, with the largest fragments i can see are in the walls of pluton. there are no boulders at all on st. george, hill 305, bennett, or, as far as i can tell, looking back up at hadley. hadley's sort of in the shadow. it's a gently rolling terrain completely around ....360 degrees -- hl_mmocky, much like you saw on 14. the pitch line ac - across the rille, from hill 305 around to i o'clock, seems to be - slightly lighter in albedo, with some white marks from craters, recent craters, apparently. bennett hill also has - a lighter-colored albedo. one face of it, that facing the sun, now is almost completely white. as i come around to my 2 o'clock, the horizon is really the northern complex. i can see, as i mentioned before, chain, icarus, and pluton are very rounded, subdued craters. it looks like the southern rim of pluton is on the same level as our location here. the northern rim is somewhat higher. i'd say dist - distances are difficult --but maybe 50 meters higher. i can _ see the scarp on the other side of the north rim of pluton. all of it very flat, smooth, and gently rolling. inside walls of pluton are - fairly well covered with debris, fragments up to, i'd estimate, maybe, oh, 2 to 3 meters, irregular, no layering, just sort of scattered around, and maybe the walls have 5 percent fragments. as i look on around - to the north, mount hadley itself is in the shadow, although i can see that the ridge line on the top of mount hadley - it too is smooth. i see no jagged peaks of any sort. the hill i would call number 22 on your map - far distance - also looks smooth and rounded; no prominent features. i'll skip the distant field around to my 6 o'clock, because it's all in the shadow. and looking into the sun, of course, obliterates almost everything. as i look on down to my - 7 o'clock, i guess i see index crater here, the near field. but, back up on hadley to the east of hadley delta, why, again i can see a smooth surface. however, i can see lineaments. i'll take a picture for you. there's some very interesting - take - silver pass [sic] and look at 13 on your map. i can't tell whether it's 13 or 16, right now, because of the sun. but there appear to be lineaments or lineations running - dipping through the northeast, parallel. and they appear to be, maybe, 3 percent to 4 percent of the total elevation of the mountain, almost uniform. i can't tell whether it's structure or internal stratigraphy or what. but there are definite linear features there, dipping to the - to the northeast, at about - oh, i'd say 30 degrees. and, as i look up to hadley delta itself, i can see what appears to be a sweep of linear features that curve around from the western side of hadley delta on down to the spur down there. and they seem to be dipping to the - to the east at about 20 degrees. these are much thinner - lineations on the mountain than i saw before. these probably are less than i percent of the total elevation of the mountain. the craters on the side of hadley delta are rather few. around window and spur, those that you see on your maps f_ are the only ones i can see, and there appear to be, oh, about a dozen of them in that particular area. i might associate those with a secondary cluster, if i took a guess at it. i see nothing that indicates any flow down - or a landslide down hadley delta, only some subtle changes in topography. there's one bright fresh crater right next to st. george on the eastern side with almost white albedo, and it's got an ejecta blanket about a crater diameter away. how are you copying so far?"
"mapping camera, on, to off. okay."
"okay, anything i need to write down?"
okay.
"okay. man, if i get this - top of this one in that picture - it's going to be a miracle."

"okay. at 211:26 we're going to do a p20 maneuver. it's going to be a rolling ?20 which will roll about the omni bravo line-of-sight to the earth. we'll need high bit rate during that time. that's why we need the - line of bravo. arid we're doing the earth study of - with the - with the luna_ sounder to determine the polarization of the noise from the earth so we can subtract it out of our data. and during these maneuvers, you're going to see a middle gimbal angle of plus or minus 65 degrees. we saw that on the - on the simulator but a word of caution on that. you'll see a middle gimbal angle of plus or minus 65 degrees."
"okay, jack. that doesn't matter. we're going to be separating the tunnel upstream of those umbilicals, and you can leave them right there."

"don, i've got one more question for you."
"okay. that crater, if you look at smythii 1 of 1, and the crater that's right above the rev 62 there, you can see a bright spot on the northwest portion there. and that's the breach zone of that particular crater. the thing that's intriguing about that to me is that if you look at the inner ring, it's a gradual slope from the center - the center of the crater is lower than the secondary - the secondary ring around the thing."
"okay on panel 250, cb bat a power, entry and postlanding, closed; bat b power entry and post- landing, closed."
"hey, i bet that was pretty, too, wasn't it?"
"5, 4, 3, 2, 1. 01 10 06 39 _2_ip roger; you're very good. okay, we're going to - bit rate is going low, and we're going s-band range to ranging. 01 10 06 h6 cc roger. 01 lc 06 50 lmp okay, how do you read now? over."

"well, high is a relative term. i had to maintain quite a bit of pressure on it to keep from being turned, but i - i tried in the 1/6 g airplane several times to see if it was too high that - or that i could- if i couldn't hold it, and i could always hold it. and i can hold it here, even though the - the torque was fairly high."
roger. that looks right. 04 10 42 12 cml° it's really impressive how much you can see in the dark.
"okay, you can go ahead to transmit."

"i guess that is do_m though, isn't it?"
"okay, we're - 0ooohl we almost ran in the middle of a big crater."
you've loaded the wrong pitch angle there in noun 22.
"and, houston, we're ready to talk over the proce- dures anytime you are, now."
not much.
"okay, jim. if we need you, we'll send a crew alert, and we'd like to know who's got the duty tonight on the biomed. is that you?"

"getting a little quiet up here anyway, gordy. that one sure snapped us out, though."
okay. .05 g is 29.
nice to be able to talk to somebody for a change -
that's the best place to shove it.
that must be tsiolkovsky over there - the chain that runs down to it.
"yes. it's going there right :iow, as a _;.avze_-of fact."

yes.
"yes. well, getting close to the landing site - f/8 or f/ll. okay. 224. i got numbers over here."
"go ahead, houston."
"all right, i will, charlie. i never thought about that. what a ca_ of worms_ 04 01 08 11 i_ coremcan really kill you, can't it?"
"okay. battery's complete, and your cue on the low bit rate."
"houston, apollo 11."
"go ahead, houston."
"and, i tell you it's going down. it was much more dramatic the first night than it was last night and it's not as dramatic tonight on the nightside passes. so, if you can find a place to put it, that is one thing i'd like to get. the sooner the better."
g_ay. have any thoughts on how - what's its origin?
"no. what's the radiator outlet temperature? 25 - no, they're not on."
"and we'll get a rover sample here before you guys leave, too, after the circular pan."
which way are we going? 03 10 10 30 imp we're going this way.
"and, by the way, i had a good view into the aot, and i can still look in there, and it's very clean."
"yeah, i guess we agree with that, but the pictures were overall real good, john. they looked - looked real good to us. you could see a lot of the detail, and i don't think we missed very much. there were some - some dark areas."
okay. we got them.

"are you ready to copy some readings, joe?"
"okay. yours is getting full, too. we got to change out bags. whoops! my bag is full?"
"well, let me - i'm going over to get my contin- gency sample, and i'll get one of the rocks - in the sample. and yes, as a matter of fact, it is built up on the side that - that the lm landed on. let me get it. well, there's one scoop. there's another with some more rocks in it. wheel this dirt's just like the one-sixth g airplane, al. flies up in the air, and you can just chase it around. boy, now, i'll tell you - you know, this sun, it - it really is - it's just somebody's got a - a superbright spotlight. here's another good looking rock. whoops! in the sample. there's another rock i want to get in it."
okay - dac off.
okay. that sounds good.
"roger. shaft is 274, trunnion 22.2."
all set?
"that rock - looks i may have, by accident, sampled the front side of one of the parting planes that i mentioned. very, very sharply bounded on one side by a planar surface."
"i don't think i even dismounted it to see those ... i know i didn't take 60 pictures of herschel, pete. did you have anything on your camera before?"
"okay, hank. i'm trying to get things all straightened up."
yes.
yes. 16 iconfiden i
"well, it's nothing worth getting upset about it, but it sure makes you start out - but, you shouldn't have to this way."
it sort of feels just like it.
"okay, thank you."
no.
"roger. our attitude according to verb 83 down there is 150 degrees, relative to the local horizontal. which means we're - i guess, fairly close to local horizontal, at least within 30 degrees."
"okay, we'll hold the burn."
good show ....
"some smart man just stepped on his own cable. 07 10 40 06 _ chas, can i interest you in something else?"
okay. i'll hold it. you do it.
good. glad to see you catching up.
"are you ready, charlie?"
okay.
"you got all three of them in the l-shaped bags, or have you got - the understanding down here, appar- ently, in talking last night was that one was in a sleep restraint on top of a-8 - in the sleep restraint bag."
"okay. when you come up on aos on the nex_ rev s rev 15, we'll give you a go or no go for another try, and we'd be looking at pdi on rev 16, and at that time, we'd have pads for you and proce- dures. over."

"and your t-start for your _an - mapping camera pad right there is 127:27:58; t-stop, 130:28:19."
"1, 2, 3 ... - -"
"got all that, gordy. thank you."
should have caught on at about a - about 45 minutes.
"okay, john."
"go ahead, jack. r g"
"man, we're right at it, and it's a deep fellow."
i'll dust it if you can't read it. i'll get it.
that's okay.
"just bring the bag back here, and i'll just work it like i usually do. you can be doing something useful, instead of just standing."
don't dump those yet. we're going to jettison them.
ail right. here's the lid.
"roger; copy 25. 05 o0 24 03 _p okay, i'll get a lil - canister change."
okay. i'm going to pull these breakers.

"roger, jack."

"yes, you did great, gene."
"we came _11 the way out here for some poor guy, we might as well try and do his experiment right."
"me, too."
"yeah, it'll - it'll be the orbit after pc-l, and there's no sweat on the lifetime, ken. they - ' they're guaranteeing a lifetime of at least a year and looking to have a fairly reasonable perigee after - even after a year, from - from the orbit f_ after pc-1."
let me hold this end. *** you put the bag on.
"roger. i'll try again, i guess. john and charlie reported a very large crater, maybe some 300 meters in diameter, that was between the lm site and stone mountain. they were on their way back from sta- tion 8, and this thing wasn't on their maps, but it was very obvious to them as they were driving."
"okay, now i've got the last shove]ful here if you're ready to copy."
the contrast. tape 91%/34
yes. vesicular subfloor. vesicles are about a centimeter maxinmm size. didn't look like they were - they look like they're fairly evenly sorted. and the rock itself seemed to be massif.
that seems like a fair setting.
"roger. o! 06 22 57 cmp don, could you tell us if - if the delta-v c number you gave us includes any kind of a bias tc compen- sate for the minute of f2_s on t--meprior to ignitior_?"
okay. sounds like a good plan.
"- - that might be a function of the sun angle, though."
"oh, it's 25 minutes."
okay.
"translation control power, off."
did you get your circuit breaker to gimbal act?
"roger. we see it, jack. and we got a reading % of minus 2 degrees on the docking index. we'd 2.1 or 1.9. _ like to know it that's 2.0 precise or if it's . _ minated on the battery b."
what does it say on the gage over there?
take over the ship and go to mars.

"yes, look at that curvature."
okay; 4.5 *** stand by - 06 16 51 48 l_o mark. okay; at 3.5.
"okay. houston, how long we been out?"
"yeah. wait a minute. i'm not sure it was all the way open. yeah, it's open, charlie; it's all the way open."
"okay, we can - -"
okay.
... is that star moving?
okay.
"am i - am i behind you, now? 06 00 57 !8 cdr-eva yes, i - i just - i'm going to start inventorying the rover and pulling the breakers so - man, we are so far off nominal on what bags. (laughter) i sort of didn't think - the checklist is going _o have to be updated, i guess."
"yes, i didn't have a chance to mention that. i don't think the regolith is very thick, and i think you've got rocks below it."
"okay. *** and that'll fill up this one - this src, and that'll do it,very nicely. 0h 22 02 07 12,_ okay. there you go."
"roger. say again, charlie."
real fine - real fine.
okay.
yes.
"okay, joe. we're sitting on 279 - system reset is off."
yes. i do now. go ahead.
"let me get lower so you can get at me. okay, how's that? at best, it is going to be bad but _e want to get as much off as we can."
"okay, stu, could you verify that you have a b-3 thruster, off, o-f-f? radar transpo_der, 0ff, 0-f-f. 04 07 21 1_ cmp verify the transponder is off, and ..."
"apollo 11, houston. about 4 minutes to 1 hour, and i'll give you a mark at 1 hour. was a command module prehe_t necessary? over."
"okay, there's a sort of angular to subrounded block going in bag number 5, tony."
yes. i can see ...
"okay. those extra pictures - - 05 23 14 51 i/wp-eva hey, tony. what is the other pic - 05 23 l_ 53 cc right, of the cosmic ray experiment. so if you'll go over to that side, we'd like a cross- sun, at f/ll, 250 at 15 feet. 05 23 15 05 i_ip-eva okay. cross-sun, f/ll, 250 at 15. /"
...
yes.
"okay. i'll get the boom, then i'll read it back to you."
"thank you, sir."
i can't do much about that.
"this is fan - you know, i just can't believe how much a thrill this is."
"orion, houston. how do you read?"
mark lmp. it was a streak; left eye; top to bottom; intensity 2; it was right at the periphery.
"and, houston, aquarius."
yes.
"endeavour, houston. did you call?"
"s_ay. i copy minus 0.!, minus 0.2, minus ..."
"ail you need is 4 minutes, yes. we'll get a dividend out of it."
okay; swinging.
"hey, gordie. in honor of one of your comm handovers last night, and in the tradition of apollo 8, i've got paraphrase of a familiar poem for you."
"joe, sounds like you're really in harmony this morning."
maypo we can only -
"go ahead, houston."
got it.
"oh, i thought you'd be able to give me a quick reading."
that's fine.
"okay, t, 2. uh-oh. 07 00 45 26 ia{p-eva what?"
weren't they - weren't these over there ...? l0 08 15 37 cml° some of them were. l0 08 15 38 l_p yeah.
"and then if you look - yes, hori - jim, horizon- tal, half - well, all the way up, i guess that - -"
"it's had that all the way along - a little bit of roll bias, there."
i've got a readback on that circ pad.
"oh, yeah. that's the - you need to come more to your *** there you go. you ought to have one *** i can't see it. it's -"
"okay, bob."
"i guess i ought to get that other stuff on the camera, huh?"
"let me get an after picture down in this hole. i_p-eva oh, that's right. you almost stepped on the - i forgot the after, too."
okay.
"dave, in all that going on with that flight plan activity - about 28 hours, we may have missed something. did you change your lithium hydroxide canister about 28 hours or so?"
or put it in my bag?
that's exactly what we're looking at - -
okay. i concur.
"is that your orb rate, charlie? 07 08 24 57 _ yeah."
ail righty.
z]henex_ one is 3015.
all right. i'd buy anything. it sure looks big.
yes.
that's affirm. we are - we are probably going to recommend a tight deadband ags attitude hold for that.
"okay. verify the - okay, i got a tone. and verify the 02 flag is clear. oh 23 36 57 cdr okay, houston. i guess here at hadley base, we're standing by for a go for the depress."
"thank you, jim."
"roger. and, 15, be advised we'll have a flight plan update in the near future."
"this was a good - would have been a good choice for a rocky traverse. see over there in the - in the west - over there in the far rim over there? don_t you see something that looks like - down in that ledge down there. 07 01 03 07 ia_p-eva yeah. there are two spots over there that might be outcrop, tony. there's - -"
like building up a chlorine content.
... a ...... ? 03 !0 44 38 cdr yes. yes....
"that's what it's supposed to do. okay, we're almost out to 10 degrees in yaw."
"yes; okay, i'm just waiting for jim to move out of the way."
"okay. we'll let it go at that. and that's all the questions and comments we have on today's traverse. we'll have a few real-time things on the surface, which i won't bother you with. a possible fix to the surface electrical properties and a possible trip back to the surface gravimeter, which is still having its problems. but i'll talk with you guys in real time on those when you get on the surface, rather than bothering you with them now."
"and line 13, 00523. over."
okay.
and a lot of - and these blocks - -
"okay. rate scale, 25 degrees per second."
- we ought to tape that bead down if we can re- member it next stop. it's in the way of - it's sticking up.
"okay, we'll get a hard copy."
"if you can't, i'll get it when i come in."
"houston, we just wanted you to know that the heart rates that you're seeing or not seeing are due to the exercise period - not the iss light."
"okay, our little helmet bag is beginning to drip, so i guess it probably would be better to trans- fer that into the urine container, right?"
"say, did they want us to - these cameras - do they want us to send them off? take the ... of this little bag, too, or just take them out and dust them and put them in that bag?"
okay. copy that.
i sure would. how long does it take?
"hey, jim, i'm going to leave you my camera - -"
"and, as you can see, houston, at turnon we got our old friend downlink 2 back."
go ahead.
"well, you got me right in the sun. can you come around this way? ho-ho. (laughter) i'm going to have to get upstream of you."
"okay, mike. your attitude hold's no longer required."
"okay. and we're stabilized at 3.7. and 02 coming off. 05 11 04 36 lm_p 3.7, starting the check. okay. _aere's 40. i have about 0.22."
got you some lunar dust.
okay.
"okay. 3kay, you're on omni charlie now."
"and with all this stuff over the next few days, it wouldn't hurt to keep a list of those things down there and connect - and kind of stay with me on those things to be sure i don't get one of them out of sync."
"man, that -"
okay.
"okay. it's well out of the sun now, houston. and it's not looking at anything. it's about a foot past the ladder."
"well, we got a good one for you, bob. not too good, but - in the midst of other things, we let the waste water go to zero on that dump. as a matter of fact, it went past zero. and the ... is starting to fill up again, and the best we can tell onboard, that - it shouldn't disturb anything, but you might take a good look at it."
"houston, the water accumulator is right on (eagle) the line between the red and the green. over."
we copy that. and we're running the cal curve.
"good evening. i'd like to discuss with you a few of the more symbolic aspects of the flight of our mission, apollo 11. as we've been dis- cussing the events that have taken place in the past 2 or 3 days here on board our spacecraft, we've come to the conclusion that this has been far more than three men on a voyage to the moon; more, still, than the efforts of a government and industry team; more, even, than the efforts of one nation. we feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown. nell's statement the other day upon first setting foot on the surface of the moon, ""this is a small step for a man, but a great leap for mankind,"" i believe sum_ up these feelings very nicely. we accepted the challenge of going to the moon; the acceptance oj this challenge was inevita01e. the relatiw ease with which we carried out our mission, i be._ieve, is a tribute to the timeliness of that acteptance. today, i feel we're f_lly capable of accepting expanded roles in the exploration of stace. in retrospect, we have all been particularly pleased with the call signs that we very laboriously (goss net 1) _ape 112/4 chose for our spacecraft, columbia and eagle. we've been particularly pleased with the emblem of our flight, depicting the u.s. eagle bringing the universal symbol of peace from the earth, from the planet earth to the moon; that symbol being the olive branch. it was our overall crew choice to deposit a replica of this symbol on the moon. personally, in reflecting on the events of the past several days, a verse from psalms comes to mind to me. ""when i consider the heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained_ what is man that thou art mindful of him."""
"yes, go ahead and stow all that shit. you stowed mine, didn't you?"
"okay. from what you say, we have to be a little skeptical of this proeedure, but we'd like to have you try it and have you evaluate it. you can monitor the middle gimbal on r3. before we power down the ball, we want you_ evaluation. the next best choice is pgns attitude hold. over."
and that's an atlantic landing site.
"hey, 15, we're getting a beautiful picture coming through."
"okay, gene; that's very clear. i think we 've got you pretty well nailed down. and you're pretty close to the - the planned landing site."
okay. and did you get jack's camera fixed last night? i didn't hear.
"okay, we're looking at the drawing here and see where you mean."
okay. it has another minute or so.
"hey, pretty good, robert. the last photo pass was a - a good one."
"okay, i think i see what you're saying. i'm sorry; i read the thing with lineal cell in a plus-x direction. but what they mean is, lineal cell in the - in - (laughter) -"
cut-off at 52. did you read the dsky?
- - plus 1.
"oh, that's always good news. and we'd like the bat i hi-volt, on; the lunar battery, off; and the bat 2, on."
hello there.
"gene, you dropped out there right in the middle."
"okay; secondary tvc check, third line from the bottom; delete ""rate, high."" that's the line right after ""limit cycle, off."""
"apollo ll, this is houston. if you'll go ahead and cycle pitch gimbal motor number i on and then off and give us a mark, and we'l_ tell you what we see. over."
okey-doke. 74.
"houston, falcon. go."
"okay, 4.5 - 4 - stand by. 06 16 51 51 lmp-i_ mark."
"well, where's the jett bag? let's put it in the jett bag."
"okay. on row 1, ac bus a: tape recorder and deca gimbal will be open. ail the rest as shown. 0h 04 05 20 cc roger. and we don't know the status of your windows. if you - during this burn, we're going to have to look out the forward window to get the alinement with the coas, so you might need the commander window heater and you can, of course, use that breaker if needed, since we do have the ac power. on row 2 - go ahead. over."
"roger, bob."
"okay, jack. it's pericynthion plus 2; sps/g&n. weight is 66373; plus 1.18, minus 0.14; ignition time is 090:49:55.82; plus 1787.5, minus 1891.7, minus 2396.8; attitude is 237, 126, 332; and all the rest of the pad is na. gdc align stars are sirius and rigel; 122; 354; 000. ullage is none. remarks: number 1, burn docked; number 2, assumes loi refsmmat. over."
what do you read down there for partial pres- sure c027
"that's it. thanks, geno."
"... magic marker ... besides, these used to be the guys ... all versions ... all the cross-subjects of the command module. although ... all the stuff ..."
"yes. - just remind myself of those little notes, like 5ha%. c7 04 27 4_ cdr fl&r}[- 2 minutes. o7 cl 27 l5 cdr and everything looks good over here. 07 64 25 37 i2,_ coming up to 1 minute, dave. 07 04 28 !8 cdr okay. 07 $4 28 41 l_ mark - 1 minute. 07 {}4 28 42 cdr okay. 07 04 28 1_3 l_p ags mode control to auto."

look at that boulder. nfidenti-aj ... --_ day 6 page 381
okay. okay? i can hit it harder yet.
"(laughter) gurgle, gurgle, gurgle. okay. 00 00 37 15 i_p okay. we want to watch ecs rad temp prim out below prim in. it's below prim in. it's looking good already. ecs talkback, gray. glycol evap 2_mp in to auto."
"okay, it's in 0 and - -"
negative. that was 72:30.
it's been about 30 - something.
"endeavour, houston."
"hello, 15; this is houston."
okay.
"roger. and then you can start to put the blunt end forward, anytime you care to."
yeah. knocked my mode switch up .... and it's all lined up. 06 21 15 37 lmi_-lm it felt like it clicked. it felt like it locked to me.
"roger. noun 33, 096:13:31.00. and your attitude is good except pitch is 105."
yes. okay. be careful. stay over here.
that's just 2?
"turn left. can you come forward and turn left? turn right. just turn right the way you were, maybe all the way around."
"okay, standing by to update the ags. had a little roll steering here."
"and it's in a-7, right?"
"you know, when i put my biomed on, my heart starts hurting ..."
"okay. and you can close it if your system has bled down. unstow press gage from eva bag and connect the gage to 603. and tape the flashlight to panel 603 guard, gene."
roger. stay for ti.
"orion, will you verify auto on the steerable?"
got it.
"houston, america. are we go for the fuel cell and waste water dump and the other dumps to go?"
"apollo ll, this is houston. if you have a minute or so free, i wonder if we could get mike to give us a little bit of clarification on what happened around about the time of docking. we copied him as mentioning that contact was very smooth, almost imperceptible; and we're a little bit inquisitive or curious about his remarks as to what happened after probe retraction. over."
"... you'll - you'll need it if you take any color pictures .... lots of ... already. what's the matter, davy?"
"houston, apollo 15. we're in p67. the ems and the g&n agree within 15 miles, and everybody's in good shape."
okay.
"okay. how far down are we going to take it? *** 5, right?"
"orion, go a simplex, ken's trying to call you."
"actually, though, i got a bunch of guys backing me up."
"okay. high gain to auto. let me see, _? _0/1_70 to enter. okay. let's see, plus 52.25. ]'lus 52.25. up-link. verb 58 enter. ... proceed to ... gets out of the way. okay. d-caldera was taken on picture number 28. it was f/8 at 1/500, and then i took three more before that. they're terminator photos, looking north across sulpicius gallus and farther north. and they were 1/500 at f/16 to start with _d lhen r/n."

"... registering 10. 04 02 54 43 cdr-lm yeah, the ... was off 10."
"watch your foot there, charlie."
"no, we're at 3000 - -"
roger.
i got to save this paper. would you get - -
"okay. a-3, a-4, a-5, and a-6 - as you have on your list right now."
pan camera.
"roger. loud and clear. we had a handover to madrid about the time i was - i guess _alfway through the pad. if you could give me the l_st value you read, i'll pick up there. 0 rer. o0 04 02 _2 lmp okay. start with del2a-v z. over. o0 04 02 i_6 cc roger. delta-v z is plus 00190, roll yc,zr option, pitch 213 357, and _ioun 44 is na. delta-v t 00197 003 00152. the rest of the pad is na, a_d . no ullage. lm weight 33 290. read back. over."
"just to be conservative, ken. l0 01 24 17 cnp okay', that's just - all right."
"mighty fine. that's good. although i was - had - getting the camera ready to take some pictures. 09 i5 16 29 cmp well, look at the one down here by - you can pick linear se_nents if you want to on some of them. one long one that goes all the way across there now, it's got a bunch of - well, this is a ... synthius [sic] one down right down here. look at this one. right - right down there. see, jusv this side of that little - the short one. c)_ okay, give me a holler on that pan c_era when it comes up because i'm going zo be t_ing pictures here; f/8 at 1/250. boy, it really shows up a flow from the tobias mayer area coming on out to - i don't kn_w w_ether - is tha_ the bessei rille or something like that? i don't know wkaz vkat rilie is. i agree with you, jack, in _hat whavever that rille is_ that's running east amd west there - made up of linear segments, excep_ for the curves around the corner (laughter)."
and the tapemeter looks good?
"... logic and auto. 11 01 45 17 i24p okay, stand by for 24. 11 01 45 20 cml° standing by. give it ..."
"okay. just continue marking, john."
"okay. i'm gonna back up here. i don't want to run into high gain, charlie."
t-l_hack gray.
"and, vance, which - what hack you got now on get?"
"houston, aquarius."
"plus ... go. now, you want verb 79 ...?"
yes. lva° okay. they 're coming up.
"it'll probably be a s_.×%_nt star check, jim. it really depends on how 6ood that platform is that we get. and we expect it to be plenty good enough for a sextant star check_"
"well, bob, it feels and looks a lot llke christmas up here, too."
"well, let's leave this stuff right here for the moment. 05 23 47 04 lmi° okay. stu's cracking the hatch."
"okay. i'm going to have my head in the cockpit here for a while, but if mr. keppler isn't a high school dropout, why, we won't hit anyhow."
anybody want to eat anything now?
"okay, pete. what time is it now?"
... had them watch you configure the camera.
how do you read? over.
yes. here on the after ... right out there.
"okay. boy, you look dirty."
and we all thank you.
give yourself a chance to open your eyes.
okay. we understand. ail your noise went away?
"o_ay, casper, go ahead with yo_ _ status report."
"jim, while you're dusting there, how many suit- cases have you carried up?"
"say, i'll tell you; there's one thing about this data file. it just is not made for me. 05 23 54 31 lm_ yes, it's not the easiest one to work with."
okay - -
"oh, i believe it, charlie. when you get in the middle of your pictures there, you might give me a call and i'll instruct you on some more we'd like."
roger.
okay; 3 minutes. okay; that doesn't give us time to really do much then.
we're holding out out for egg nog tonight.
"_]most all these craters in the - let's see, can we say that the - i see no elongate craters at all. i'm just looking in the area just past mandel'shtam. the dark areas seem to have more craters and more small craters. the light areas have - not so many craters."
you locked up good?
"okay, we had our comm drop out here, and i under- stand charlie got his water switched over."
"mode control, both, att hold."
not a word about it. i'm sorry. 03 17 18 36 i34p ...
"yes, but you're going to be looking at the nadir, arentt you?"
"okay. on the - on the agenda here, we have remain- ing documented samples, and we need a pan. 05 14 35 19 l_q_ roger. we'll get it for you."
"yes, you need a reinfo - forced toe section."
"- - 5. now, let me go back to f:ll. 04 22 18 25 _ okay."
"- - passing the quark triplet that's on your right, probably, and we'll be most likely be directing _ you back towards the western crater in that trip- let for some mare sampling towards the end."
okay.
right there.
"roger. thank you, karl. transcript of communications betw-_rn cc and lm resumed f apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription"
they certainly seem to be.
huh?
you want to do a p20 first.
i'm going to turn around.
"and on the stellar camera door, how far out was it?"
"that's all right. no, i can handle it, i think, here. but we're going to need your tongs to pick them up and not get them all confused. okay, where's the shadow graph? there it is. sun quadrant - that's the sun quadrant. /_' cdr-eva for sure we lost that fender."
"suit gas diverter, pull-egress. these are verify."
i'll turn off the intercom.
"okay, houston. you should be getting a picture about now."
"charlie, you're gonna fall down here with all these rocks."
"i'm going to torque. 04 12 53 45 i_p i'm not breaking lock, damn it."
okay.
one picture of that rock under the descent stage - -
"roger. could we get one from john and charlie? 09 03 31 o1 c_ okay. say again what you got, john."
we'll have to wait for you to get a lockon again. is that correct?
"... the maps - - 06 23 i1 51 lmp-eva i'm ready to get the tools off, dave, any time you are."
"and just - why don't you - the camera - i'll tell you what - well, here, i'll hold it and you take this one off."
"okay. jack has turned off ring 1 that was on main a, and he's still reading 30.2 volts."
"houston, apollo 11. roger."
"15, houston. we're getting a lot of static for some reason. say again, please."
roger. go for pdi.
"you know that p30 pad i used for a model, dick? where did it go?"
...
"bob, i'm going to take the pan at ll *** so you can see the fragments that we are going to pick up here. then we can take another one at - for location work."
*** get some.
okay. i've got eva-1 prep; now which coll_mn?
"- - update to csm - ti and t2 times for fra mauro photographs. update to csm; tei 34 pad, map update rev 11, csm dap pad, comm attitude, and high gain. uplink to csm; state vector, verb 66 - -"
"at 273:30, delete ""alpha particle/x-ray cover, open."" 09 19 54 18 cml° okay."
okay.
it didn't fit....
"yes, jack will be on tonight with the biomed and the headset."
"okay. iow i've still got vhis note that we've had since about 24 hours ago on changing the angle on that su___wheei_ and if :you have that out now, we can clear_ that up_ otherwise, i_ll hold it a while."
"oh, wait a minute. i got - i got - well, maybe it isn't a dikelet. maybe it's just a screen covering, a flow covering."
"okay. that sounds like a good observation. 06 09 55 49 cml° look at alphonsus. i'm looking at the eastern or the dark gray craters, the one that's almost due east of the central peak, the largest ring deposit there. and to the _muaided eye, it stands out quite dramatically. when i put the binoculars on it, _he difference is extremely subtle. you really have to look for it, and then it just turns out to be a slightly different color, but i can't say anything at all about any difference in textures or any other thing that's different except that there's a slightly different color to it. but it's more obvious to the unaided eye than it is to the eye with magnification."
yes.
"that's affirmative, america. we read you loud and clear."
"okay; if you could read us your gimbal angles, please. 04 02 46 bb cmp okay; ri is plus 00124, r2 is plus 10166, rb is _ plus 00537."
"apollo 13, houston. los carnarvon in about 30 seconds. honeysuckle on the hour, and verify your s-band is up for honeysuckle. over."
look at that son of a bitch.
that scoop there_you can't get it up high enough to use it. that's part of the problem is the scoop holds it way down.
"okay. and remember you'll be taking photos coming back here, jack - -"
"go ahead, aquarius."
"no - no, the earth."
okay.
"okay, houston. we've got you on the high gain now, and we'll check our circuit breakers, be ready to cycle the cameras when you're ready."
"okay, i'm within about 15 degrees. if you want to give me your :mark, i can stop it about where you need it. 05 23 26 59 cml° okay, why don't you just stop it there. i need to translate down and tc the right, anyway."
loose rules. o3 ll 26 59 c_m okay.
roger. where do you hold me cutting out? over.
tie her down good; we couldn't loose that; we'd be sunk.
you don't want to monitor the - ... you want to do that? ...? ...
i think that takes care of them all.
"okay? ... fenders. you've got a fender, jim. get your fenders?"
ail right. you guys are doing pretty good. you're almost caught up.
i didn't mean to. 0b 12 55 24 cmp one minute to go.
"15, houston; stand by for pan camera, off."
......
"mark. barber pole, and it's gray. okay. going to the mass spectrometer. deploy."
"okay, you're - it's partially covering the rover, but i think it's a pretty good shot. how's that? let me get the focus right. ,"
"say again, bob. you want that - i don't have a scoop, i don't even have a rake."
roger. in work.
"okay, he's got a 5-foot-a-second closing rate, and his line of sights are nul!ed on the radar."
okay. got a bunch of shit floating around here; i never saw anything like it.
"a good answer. now, look, try to keep him - you're going to track him anyway. try to keep him in my window and i'll take some shots of him."
"no, it's microbus [sic]."
"oh, pretty good. got our solar corona done, and we got a little 16-millimeter strip ... - un- fortunately, i missed the first couple of minutes wh_le i was changing mags, but you'll pretty close to a full rev. this has turned out to be a - i was looking through the flight plan to see a good rev: and it looked like this one has the hatch winmow pointing almost straight down; it's prob- ably the best rev we got going."
"okay, go ahead."
"he's just knocking me in the head, houston, in case you're wondering what's going on. 06 05 47 37 lm?-eva got it off, though, you got to admit."
mapping camera is coming on.
"i fail to understand why all my friends who used to operate the backroom, even though it's sunday, why they haven't given you a sort of an interim report on what they - what they think happened at taurus-littrow. they usually have those things available."
okay.
"no, i don't think it was."
"okay, gimbal motors check. two - 01 11 30 52 cml° mark it. two - 01 11 30 55 cml° mark it. one -"
"no, i'm coming down to - no, no, i'm leaving them at -"
"oh, good. now hold mine; and you can pull yours off easy; and i'll get you a cap. 06 22 06 24 i2_p-eva hold that end."
"okay. i didn't realize that it would. we would have left it on, but thank you for telling us."
okay. ease down here. okay.
"okay, houston. go ahead with the pad."
... god damn ...
"yes, 60. looks like sc_e of our gray variety of subfloor up here *** rim of that little crater. *** think that maybe the gray relatively nonvesicu- lar subfloor may be deeper - deeper fraction #** what we saw - well, actually, though, let's see - that could have been overturn, i don't know. take that back. there just isn't much of it around here, although we saw a lot of it in the wall of cochise."
"okay. it'll be load delta, and the octal identifier 05, and its new value is 01637."
"well, see that? see the white fragments in there?"
"it'll stay there. okay, we got everything else. okay. - -"
okay. is that going to have enough time delay - on your call that's going to - i guess - i guess i'm concerned about making it worse.
"better get my legs, then i'll ..."
"this, i think. isn't it?"
127.
main a.
okay. we're going to probably need numerics lighting. there you go. you got it.
"columbia, houston. how do you read?"
it's very frustrating.
check drink bag position.
what - what all is in the checklist to do between now and tonight? anything?
what are we going to do with this thing? can we throw it away?
"i don't think we can do it. okay; ten clicks, tony."
roger.
"how's the ecs looking to you now, tony?"
"here, let me stow that dac."
i didn't see those yesterday. it was all in the shadow.
"yes, it should be just done."
mine is back to emu. already done that pretty (tranq) well.
"copy, 11."
"houston, endeavour. go ahead."
"okay, let's get you the read-out first, and we're going to bounce up the cabin here very shortly with the ops."
"well, you been lonely without us?"
"and, jack, how's the rooster tail look on that fender?"
okay. my gloves are on and the straps are adjusted.
"9411, 35268 - - 01 06 40 20 hmp wait a minute."
"no, that!s just about what we were thinking too, karl."
"the sun would have been some better - it would have been better if it could have been a little bit higher. because when i went down around the side of the mapping camera, it was pretty dark."
roger.
"believe it or not, gordy, i'm ready for your pad."
right; it'll be 354 at 3.4.
"no, spook's about - let's see - at 0.6, we should be at spook, huh? let's see. spook is at 100 at 0.9. not there yet. we're only 0.6, tony. okay. this ray field has the same pebbles and cobbles and some good secondaries here."
"it's hard to tell at this density and pressure of gas, but comfort level is about the - about the same as the command module."
"al, we'd like to go pitch, minus ll; yaw 12, without changing the mode switch."
"okay, pga is not biting, lcg's cold s let's leave it cold."
"okay, we copy that."
you've got your full measure of rock right here. okay. let me go get the sample bags.
"that new refsmmat was pretty close to the old one - just a couple of degrees, right?"
"boy, it sure shows in the binoculars as an entirely different texture. when you look at it, it doesn't look surprisingly so much. just to the north - just to the northeast of green, there is a dis- tinctly different textured unit that shows up. it looks like a flow. it's just spread out in there. and it does indeed look distinctly different. the terraces in green are large banks, but there's no evidence of bedding in them. they just look all slumped, except for some little patches every now and then, flat places. and one little spot looked that like it had a dark - block on it or something."
set it down just outside the shadow there. right - . whoa - right there. that's good. there's still some good clean ground there. okay.
okay. (chuckle )
and also request your lm/cm delta-p which was on the flight plan for 53 hours. what did you vent it down to? over.
"5.6. we roll 180. 5, 4.7 -"
"okay, houston. we're going to maneuver to the horizon check attitude now."
"okay. i'm coming. here we go 3.6, .7, .8. 06 19 14 34 cdr-i_m okay, i'm stabilized. my 02 flag is clear. if you can get a hold of that little valve again_let's turn them off and get an integrity check."
"go ahead, karl."
"yes, they got the number."
"flight plan, malfunctions, and all that jazz is in there _:"
"roger; understand. high gain, minus l0 and 260 on high gain. and follow that up by the gamma ray - gar_ia ray door - alpha/x-ray door to open, and the ga_$1a ray shield, on?"
"pass. 03 oh 44 58 lye pass. 03 02 _h 59 smp pass. 03 04 45 15 q,{p hey, ... why don't you leave it on there. last night, we noticed it took a little while for the narrow to take effect. 03 oh 45 21 d.'p ail right. 03 0h 45 32 c]_p okay. circuit breakers. let me check them again. 03 oh 45 39 imp houston; 14 on the high gain. how do you read?"
"geno, it's time to charge them again, if you want to."
"and, ken, have you got a couple of minutes to listen to a few words about servo loop."
nothing· as a matter of fact -
"go ahead, 16."
"okay, karl. go ahead with the tei-37."
what straps are holding you down? all of them? 05 22 31 58 i24p yes. what ...
suppose that's where we are? is that one - that one over there?
"hey, can you push down on this side of that? 04 21 t0 27 cdr yes. my biggest sweat is trying to bend over. wait a minute. ready, get set, push. that on, or not?"
when do we get acquisition?
okay. transponder's coming on at ...
okay. i'll take it at 8 feet.
and a 250th is set.
[:tireand pitch is good. 05 21 49 48 i2_p [!{-dotis good; h is good; ags are right together.
copy that.
suppose it's outgassed or something?
hold this - hold this end.
okay; each one of those bubbles looks like it's the locus - or the start of one of the benard cells.
"okay. well, the feeling- -"
it's going to fall down the hill. you'd better stomp off a good place.
yeah (laughter).
"endeavour, this is houston. rover has just hit the ground. you don't see it down below you, do you?"
"okay, we'd like to start up in single jet, which is what you have now. 09 23 22 38 cml° okay. i'll use the jet configuration i have now, then."
you take cabin photos during rendezvous.
we can get it after your ... - -
you should have done that in the dark.
"you know, i've found a use for every geology tool on this - got back here."
yes.
okay; 04:30 and we're still go on board.
"we're at 244/0.4. i_p-eva bob, i may have said earl - early - early on up there at van serg that i saw subfloor, but we never did sample any that i know of. and the dust was thick enough that i'm just not sure. breccias were the most obvious thing there."
"hey, houston; america."
that's affirmative.
"_hank you, boss."
very well.
"and, i sure agree on that beautiful day's work."
"hey, jack. _le lm checklist is just for infor- mation to jim. it's just to tell him that - that you're changing back to command module power. your checklist is correct. over."
careful. you're in a hole. can you - you better come out. lmp-ev& yes.
altitude go to zero. power signal on. cross pointer's centered. i'm not going to be able to see that power light. i've used that to tell me when the radar dropped in and out. okay. read that again.
okay. we copy that.
(laughter) i think i'm going to.
"we're rolling, bob. i_4p-eva i24p frame - is 130."
*** my bag already?
on and locked.
okay.
(laughter) looks pretty low.
we want all zeros in there.
"yeah, i see ken."
"okay. apollo 17 air-to-ground voice transcription 0© 21 10 24 lmp bob, you with me?"
on a previous shutdown - -
let's call that 3.
0h!
okay.
"okay, the eight ball didn't move. it's a cdu fail light's what it is. ll _ page 465"
"okay, and pressure's coming down. ijvlip-i_iokay. i believe it."
"okay. it's closed and locked. 06 06 01 18 ls_-_ okay. 06 06 01 2_ cdr-lm it's locked. 06 06 01 25 lm?-z24 okay, i think the cabin repress is next. okay, and let me read the next step."
"sorry about that. speak up there, james. okay, we got to maneuver?"
get the stick?
okay. that right now? three core tubes and a long can?
"roger. copy, charlie. 11 00 23 39 _ houston, the evaporators are up."
"recovery, apollo 15. everybody's in good shape, and we're looking at about 3500 feet. 12 07 09 43 r this is recovery. i have a visual of 165 - -"
"that's affirm. between the end of that arrow and the lens, about halfway, is a little dot that represents the v ever h assembly. now, the camera lens will be covered - rather it will be folded up so you will not be able to see it; however, that is the item you are looking for, represented by the small circle about halfway in between the end of the arrow and the lens of the camera."
roger.
"okay. alfa 1, 22047; alfa 3, 6; alfa 4, negative. bravo 1, 15044; bravo 3, 6; bravo 4, negative. charlie 1, 21095; charlie 3, 7; chariie 4, 1 seconal."
okay. i'm going to go ahead and bleed it down the rest of the way.
"well, stick it in the purse."
"well, that's what i °.. i could do if i drove slow. ail right, be glad to."
los? 06 18 15 54 i/rfp ... sound.
okay. you want both h2 tank 2 heaters to off. is that correct?
"okay, jim. it didn't work. i was looking at the shadow, and the pitch goes around nicely. you can watch it move. it oscillates quite a bit before it damps, but the yaw i can't get to move at all, so i guess it's belly up."
you're loud and clear.
eps sensor si(]ll/khmain b closed on panel 5.
"okay, we'll burn this."
"well, i hope you had a good meal."
"oh, man."
how's that for ... (laughter).
because i can't see to sample.
huh?
"okay. houston, aquarius."
"gordy, this is jack. i think gene was right. you got some - probably scattered cloud weather, but not very far away from you there's a pretty heavy mass of clouds. it may be the forerunner of that dry cold front you were talking about yesterday, which i can see stretching over into sonora. but where it hits the stateside, it's got quite a mass of clouds associated with it. it looks like they're moving in your direction."
"roger. go for pdi. okay, pro for final trim."
"- - got your favorite gadget stowed back here, dave."
"no, it didn't say anything h-dot."
"go. and it's 15 - no, that's - -"
"okay, we'll torque at 45 - 42:15."
"go ahead, 15."
111 miles. 111 miles.
"okay, don, i guess that's it. i'll see you folks tomorrow. oh 14 00 l0 cc okeydoke, casper. pleasant dreams. 04 14 o0 17 cml° you must know somebody to get a shift like this."
roger.
"i have ... in, and it seems about as cold as it is now, we'll probably be going into suits long before entry."
"hey, dick? ... same side as the ..."
"okay, i - i think i inverted them. it's a spiral of 282 and a curser of 184."
yes.
"(laughter) yeah, i did get it a little high."
one.
"okay, because those clips are just ..."
this is coal black.
"},_&znbus ties are off."
... see that.
okay. we'll do the whole smash here for you.
roger.
"loud and clear, don."
yes.
thank you.
"thank you kindly, (columbia )"
"copy. and - and we think that's probably an in- dication of the sensor problem, but stand by."
huh?
and we'd like frames when it's convenient on you guys.
yes. okay.
okay.
"so, wait until we get there."
"15, houston. give us auto and narrow on the high gain, please."
"roger. and for your information, your current altitude is 148 nautical miles above the surface. 03 06 50 39 lm? don't you think?"
"okay, tony, i'm up to frame count 90 on magazine lima."
okay. just a second.
"okay, .o. 5°6 and 4_9."
"okay, i'm looking at h - at about _.7 on the suit loop right now."
we should have done that all along - i guess.
"well, it's not - get a little open here. every second i spend opening it up is worth about 2 minutes when you try to put it in the bag. okay. i think it's open now. 05 1_ 25 58 lmp hey, i got a shiny tube for you."
"i'll tell you, these sun angles really can play tricks on you, and i'm looking at m_dler now, and i got a real good view of him. and we dis- cussed the possibility of having material cc_e in from the north and run down inside of him. and it's not that obvious when you look down on him from here. there's materisl that runs over - you see a little high. as you look down inside, you see light and dark material, the same kind of combination you see in other craters. with the naked eye, it looks very much like - there's an expression that says that this ridge to the north ran down inside there and formed that little tongue. but when you look at it in blown-up de- tail, you see some vertical - well, now i can see places where i can see a flow pattern that's run down in. and, as a matter of fact, i'll get a picture real fast. hope that gets it. )5 04 06 42 cc do you think that - just looking at a map here - do you think that what you're seeing could be an expression of the rim of nectaris?"
okay. you in what - now what do you want it now?
"had a photo pass just coming up on the landing site that time. it was photo target 25, caucasus mountains, which i skipped to do the vhf voice check."
"- - we're going to get a main bus a undervolt, probably."
you know you're going to be in there for a few hours.
roger; we copy.
"houston, america. do you still read?"
"roger, gordo. we're ready to get the pyro arms and logics on now."
"shoot, it's to now about 3 - between - 330."
"okay. unstow helmet bags, accessory bags, and tool e."
yeah?
"okay. are there any distinctive features, other than color, to separate tan from blue-gray breecias, such as joining, or massive nature, continuity, anything of that nature? lmp-_4 yes, we're - -"
the big bag didn't stay closed very long.
tiqere's the ones tha%'s going to be ... (laughter).
"okay; plss fans, on."
okay .... lmp-_ i hope so. physics says it should have been. cdr-_ there's an experiment.
getting a little uv here.
"well. okay, let's check the numbers, charlie."
"smells a long time .... you guys are putting that on the tape, too...."
should have vacuumed those things (laughter). and particularly since you're going to be looking into the sun (laughter).
"right on time to the second. this thing is a dream. pag2e28 ay5 04 00 14 10 ln_° okay, john. poo. i got a - i give you verb 60. 04 00 14 15 cml:) i see you rolling, or yawing, as you guys do it. i see one, two, ought to see four ... haven't seen them yet."
"no, no, it won't go that way. .itwon't make any differen ce."
"roger, ed."
okay. roger. out.
"i should be able to get back there next rev, i guess."
"okay. here's two gloves, right here."
"oop .... -- 06 05 12 09 i24p-lm yes, that's what i thought. watch the lid _- doesn't come open."
- - yaw zero. 03 ll 34 51 c_[p you've got the high gain angles right there .... ; there you go!
"that's the one we picked up on the map, we called ..."
"casper, houston. we've got just a few minutes here to los, and everything looks good from this end. we'll probably do a shift change in here while - during los. stu will come on, and i'll see you in the morning. a last reminder to configure your dse at 127:01."
"oh, my. _- 05 02 01 50 lmp-eva it should be 2.7, so we got another .7 to go."
"okay, houston. we're ..."
"okay, that's deleted. okay."
did you do it the last couple of nights?
"ll, this is houston. over."
okay - -
okay. frame 61.
go ahead.
in about 18 seconds?
"ken, for your information, the lm is not goinc to do a p22."
"columbia, this is houston. over."
"i'm going to draw a picture, here, while i'm thinking of it."
"okay, bob. will do. we'll give you a call as we go along."
"okay, jim. your rates look good. it's okay to start the roll again, if you'd like."
"roger. is davy still in the dark? r0502 16 14 cmp well. i'm not to it yet, but it sure - i don't see anything beyond it. that's a - hey, old alphonsus and arzachel show up nicely. and here comes the crater chain, by golly. yes, but much to n_ amazement, but the peak in albategnius is still - is in daylight."
"ready to copy, al."
"that's unless you start - start an hour and 20 minutes late, and then it's burn time plus 5. tape 58//2"
and we got a picture.
okay. suit diverter valve to pull egress.
call houston and give them your 02 reading.
"okay. you collect - or connect to the plss comm ... audio circuit breakers, here."
"falcon, houston. pcm, low, please."
i'n sorry. you misunderstood the question. i me_lnt the rim of cone crater.
"okay, we'll verify it. stand by. it's checked but we'll check it again."
"okay. i got the magazine off the dac, tony."
sorry about that.
"oh, i'd say the - the last folding lip is up against the handrail. well - yeah, just about that far."
"okay. do they want it on or off? leave it off, huh?"
"okay, we're standing by for the - the landing radar checkout, john; and, of course, charlie, you go that t2 at pdi at 24 plus 25, and i have an ags k-factor for you. 04 00 45 52 t24p okay, go ahead with the ags."
we're going to slide right out of here - ... get some ...
roger.
okay. going to it. thank you.
"columbia, houston. over."
eleven percent.
i don't know whether it's tough or not. you mean hard.
what can i say? i'm crying.
okay.
"it only took us l0 minutes to stow the plss. 05 06 58 _7 cc well, that's about 2 minutes better than usual. ·05 06 58 59 lmp-lm oh. okay. okay. com_nder's plss, lmplee's - lm's plss - could have missed that."
"okay. 16, your evap out temp looks good now."
the backup crew copies.
"okay, bob. i'm going to put bus b and d, open, and aux circuit breaker bypass, on."
...
mark it.
"wouldn't it, though?"
"now you're going to have to move way over there, so i can get the hatch."
"okay. the gimbal test option. 03 04 54 41 c¥_ okay, let's let her rip. up 2!. _own 2, zero ...."
- - get that out of the way.
"on this - on this event timer, charlie, i got 04:16. is that right? 09 03 33 50 _ that thing ain't working. no. can you see the sunsight, ken?"
"roger; loud and clear, charlie. or was that charlie?"
"- - just behind the lm in that very fresh crater, i picked up an example of the kind of gabbro i was talking about. and i'll stick it in the big bag, except the big bag has disappeared."
- - in the dust. we'll never clean them out. i m-evi
okay; that makes sense.
yes.
"oh, okay."
"say again, joe. try another mag? 06 23 28 06 irp-eva no, it's too late for that."
"no, the antenna is in my way."
the what?
well - i don't - i don't want to get the chips. i want the soil. either that or a coherent rock.
just like the simulator.
and the sun is going down on schedule. it's getting real dark in here.
pmw [sic] is in both. and the drive enable is in - all those switches are up and the - steering is okay. going to primary. we're in for a nav align.
"oh, i been looking ... i put it in here ...."
"okay, jack. you're a - there you go. okay. _at does it look like to mou?"
you is logged.
"ken, we'll went narrow dead band on that. we got a camera pass coming."
"ail right. is there any indication that the fillets are directional, in other words, that the fillets are heavier on one side than the other? cdr-i_! bob, haven't noticed that. 05 04 01 _9 cc okay, i copy that. do you have the feeling that some boulders are more rounded - ' cdr-i_ well that's a good - - that's a good -"
it's this one right under here - you can't - no? there you go.
okay. your being in pad burn attitude for the - is causing the comm problem. i'm sure it is. it's barely hanging on to enough signal strength %0 talk.
"that's correct. and now, on the first star of p23, we're going to change the star, so cross out - replace the noun 70 numbers with star 21. that would be three balls 21. and delete the noun 88 and the vector numbers there."
hello_ houston; america.
"there - i - i can't perceive anything, joe."
"stand by, gordy."
wonderful. brewed it myself.
"and i assume you're handling the dse now so - yeah, looks like you got it."
"looking good, jack."
"my legs don't get a bit tired, but your hands get tired carrying these tools, particularly the handtool carrier."
"roger, jack. meanwhile, we'll look at the situation you describe there."
can you poke one of the legs into the surface there?
say again.
sps pressure light.
"no, it's a lot - a lot better. i remember from 8 when they didn't hardly ever get to look at either one."
ail right.
"t-start is 128:19:09, 128:20:47."
"oh, i don't know, over by cinco they're not that obvious. they are further around to the west, but i'm not sure that recognize the first terrace. they might recognize cinco."
"that next charge goes off in 15 minutes, jack. i don't have an exact get yet."
"it's 2.2, gordo; i put it back in vent."
"okay, inverter to 2, and cross out inverter 1."
hmm!
"okay. what we're really going to do - (chuckle) really is simple. at 65 hours we're going to do the update of 2 hours and 40 minutes. and the: procedures are shown in the flight plan at 67:35. there just happens - happens to be really no - no activities we have to reschedule in the intervening time. so, after the update is complete, we'll be right on the flight plan, both timewise and activ- itywise. over."
"yes, must be ... low. time skip"
yes.
okay. plus 29 and 27.
isn't there a medical kit in the lm?
half a degree.
that's right.
that's good. somebody will get something out of all this.
"i sure hope that that doesn't prove - you know, that's like mcdivitt looking at that - what was it that happened there, and you could see he really made the right decision when he decided to delay the launch even though the information that made it the right decision occurred after he made his decision. (laughter)"
no.
okay. here we go.
"okay, verified. plss pump, on, _o the right? 06 19 12 31 lm_ pump comin_ on. 06 19 12 _3 cdr mine's running an_ - 06 19 12 35 l_qp same."
"i knew they wanted that, gordy, and that's why i only gave you one."
"okay. that's 02 flow high, as expected."
"don't kick dust on it. hope i can read it down here. okay. okay, bob. bob, you're going to have to bear with me. when i leaned over to punch it, i hit gravity instead of read, so i guess i got to wait it out."
"that's affirmative. 'oxidizer greater than fuel"" in both c_;es, in other words_ your range is oxidizer 12 to 50 psi greater them the fuel pressure,"
god damn that zhing.
"ee and kk. okay, what kind are they? are they cex?"
okay. we're with you.

"oh, okay. c_ houston, i'm ready for the flight flan u_date."
"houston, 16."
look at that.
"say again, fred."
yes.
i loved that first ... - -
"and in connection with this de - deterioration of the pan camera, there is some feeling that as time tape108/43 goes by it's getting poorer end poorer and that maybe we should occasionally pulse it on the self - test cycle to take just a - five frames on - on interesting regions as we go along in order to get the film used up before it really deteriorates to a greater degree. i guess we're asking for your opinion on that. do you have any feeling about that?"
"john, i think that total is still slightly retrograde."
"okay, jack, we're recommending magazine hotel, and we also suggest you take the second pan, when you retake it, at 74 feet."
"and, ron, your friends down here said that they could hear you on the vhf loud and clear."
"- - is that a reasonable area for a rake sample, _-_ do you think?"
okay. you can forget all i told you about verb 22 noun 46.
this is houston. go ahead.
"okay, and we'll be expecting you to be in vhf bistatic later on, right."
"there you go; that's - see that's the t. at cdh, 1.53. okay. lg"
"okay. you moved the antenna, john."
"man, it all looks the same, doesn't it?"
"yeah, i was just thinking about that. that'd be a good idea. we're right on the rim of - we're really right on the rim - there's rocks right on the rim of - both plum and flag."
very good.
thank you.
"roger. we copy. 04 08 32 18 cdr-i_m what a neat place (laughter). 04 08 32 21 i_p-i_ say, jim, this ridge in front of us does look like a subdued crater and it may be the raised rim about 50 meters in front of us, about, oh - 4 or 5 meters tall. about 30 or 40 percent of the surface is covered with boulders that are maybe half a meter in size. on out in front of us and to the right, where we landed, there were - -"
can you smell nitrogen? smell something up here.
right.
okay. landing antenna is auto.
yes. that's good.

okay.
you'd never speak to me again.
"ron, it's the dark crater on the slide, the dark crater on the slide."
... 172 to 27.
right. well - shoot - ail right. i got to stop what i'm doing. let me come over here and get it. here i come.
"that's affirmative, jack. go ahead and cycle it open."
how about that?
"okay, houston; 15. out of 40k, and we're showing about a .7, .2, this business now. everybody's in good shape."
"ail right. let's go straight ahead. okay. tony, we're heading about 300 and 187. the large boulders, tony, will be off to our right. there's a - a black to brownish looking one, and then there is a solid white one off towards - that's right at the base of smoky mountain and north ray. that might be worth a little jog over there if it's not too far. it's the most unique white boulder we've seen."

question number l0 for a1 worden. what runs through the mind of a man orbiting the moon alone?
"roger, pete. we copy."
"you guys make a pretty interesting show to watch. lmp-im i hope so. lmp-_4 ail i can do is hear your breathing, ken."
we agree.
"okay, it's off and the talkback went gray, with it going off."
al?
good show. you ready to copy?
what about it?
"are you finished at the mesa for a little bit, dave ?"
okay. let me - -
can't argue with that.
"(laughter) no, i haven't. let me try. that's a good idea, though. i'll try that and see what i can come up with on that thing."
"okay, when you get to attitude, you can pro to activate the entry ja - dap."
"if we could get a - i think it's going to be hard to get a double core here. we could try a single right there. bob, we got time to get the core?"
"yes, i ..."
check your ags needle.
it's time to go?
"verb ....verb 06 noun 20, and i'm ready to ..."
"okay, i'll deploy number 2 and 4. and, let's see, that's number 1. this one must be number 2. it is."
"well, okay, that's - that's true."
"okay. volts are 39.5; amps, 1.24. stand by."
that's good. it'll do that; then it'll come back.
go ahead. oh 04 12 38 cc - - null the line-of-sight rates and fire 5 feet per second toward the lm.
"yes. that's verified, isn't it?"
"we're reading - 292, 292, 347, 8.9, 3.4, 94100, 89, 90; motor temps, both - low."
... 8.
"well, if you dropped it, i'd of worried about the heat shield."
yes. i just want to get our bearings here. you can't look to the east.
"okay. bounds good. you're going to give me an overall time line now, i take it; is that right?"
it's about 2950.
"hey, let's get this all cleaned up ... - -"
"okay, stand by one and i'll check on that. 07 04 1_ 13 cc okay, jack_ we can stick those _hings on _he comm panel for now, and then tomorrow on page 7-14, it's going to have you stow them in the l_ja bags buy for the time being if you just 3tick those up on the panel, set them aside - you'll use them tomorrow. lmp-_ okay, ken got you. yes, they're going to get the inside of the leva pretty dirty."
"roger, jim. good morning."
"okay; and we've got the - hey, is the dac supposed to be on? yes, the dac on. okay. turning the dac on."
"do it at 30, al."
"roger dodger. we got eagle looking good. it's holding cabin pressure and it picked up about 2 feet per second from that jettison. 05 10 ll 19 imp i believe that. i can see some cracks on the outer coating around the tunnel. in the thermal protective covering, i don't think it has any- thing to do with the structure."
"roger. spacecraft is in real good shape as far as we're concerned, jim. we're bored to tears down here. we do have a few little items for you, like a p37 update and a couple of flight plan updates. but there's no rush about them. over."
yes.
"okay. do you need - you don't need sun alignment - you don't need a sun alignment or any of that stuff, do you?"
okay.
okay. would you go reacq and narrow?
"i'm sure vhey've got some - some rule that's mandatory for the biomeds for the eva. 04 03 !_ 59 cmp you want to bet a six-pack? i mean, i don't know, but i'm just - the way the system operates."
"and, dave, you'll want it to drop into the ground as slowly as you can easily control."
that's why; because it wasn't locked.
okay ....
"roger. according to the map, they're just exactly east and west."
i got to get up a little higher.
"if we had that suit we could bend over in, we'd have the job done by now."
"roger. omit steps l, 2, and 3; perform step 4."
...
"oh, manischewitz!"
here ...
right.
- - minus 049.66.
we want to keep the temperature of the panel down - -
"taking three up this time, jim? _--_"
"right, and we're working on procedures for that. ken's been doing quite a bit of work on getting ready for entry."
"okay, we got 43,000 feet, ken."
all right· close on the potable - waste down 50.
"okay, that should do it."
okay. 06 09 55 03 cml° and the cayley floor fill i see in ptolemaeus. and all of these things look exactly like what you see in mendeleev. i've been looking for some- thing i could say was different. i don't see a thing.
okay.
"houston, 15."
...
"watch it, jack."
loud and clear. (eagle )
copy that.
"tiouston, eagle, lmp. how do you read? over."
"ok_r. and when you're finished, you can flop it arolmd so they can see it a little better on the tv."
okay. fine.
"okay, america; houston. i've got a short update on your entry checklist."
no.
"okay. 1g 20 59 14 cc jack, reference your - the blink you noticed or possibly noticed - we, looking at the data, see about bo seconds prior to the time we think you mentioned that it happened but that's close to the time frame, i guess, a i or 2 amp oscillation in the main b voltage or current. and it only lasted for one or two data cycles, or like o.1 or 0.2 of a second is all. we would like to know, though, approximately what setting all the floodlights are at rightnow."
"falcon, houston."
mark. mode i bravo.

copy that.
"there i was at 240,000 coming over the top. 05 23 18 57 l_ and there's our home. that's our home away from home."
roger. go ahead.
"ok_ ' fine ' we 'il give you another call, as soon as we get data here."
roger. copy.
"_en i get the hatch partially opened, you cmn go to auto on that valve."
"okay, henry. it feels like if we had - we're clipping the tops of the trees all through there - what it looks like. we got a burn report of a delta-t. 0.... all we got was 24.4, plus lg' two balls 06 - 2106 vgx ' trim attitude 001, 272, 003; so we did not trim. residuals were plus 0.8, plus 0, plus 0.1; minus 2.3 delta-vc_ fuel 337, ox 346. over."
okay.
"okay, houston. ron's putting the camera out there on the pole now - pole out there, rather."
"i'm bearing, bob. cdr'eva hey, what else - -"
"america, houston. we'd like to try antenna i again. we'd like you to go extend for barber pole plus 3 seconds, then off, then retract."
"repress package, off."
"... no, we didn't disturb it at all."
tell me where you want it.
okay. secure harness and self doff straps.
"16, no answers yet. we're still looking at it."
"okeydoke. well, we're - we're all unsuited now, and we're about ready to talk and eat at the same time, or listen and eat here at the same time. and it won't be long and we'll be ready ko hit the sack."
"man, we're going to dirty it up, pal. i'll tell you, we'll do our best_ but we are filthy. i don't really think it's that bad, though. host of it will stay in the lm."
"that's ron. got his vhf on, that fink. hey, you might tell ron we can hear him."
"okay. in the meantime, stu, for you or ed, we'd like you to try a normal acquisition again on the high gain antenna, and, if that's no go, try acquisition in manual and medium beam width. over. 04 03 54 05 cml° okay. let me get down here and give it agc. 04 03 55 19 cml° houston, how do you read lb?"
"okay, open and then auto at 3 and a half. okay."
(laughter) i already have. i didn't wash it with the right thing though.
"wait a minute, i've got to close the repress valve. you got it all right. okay; it's closed, and i'll get where i was yesterday."
"roger, houston. see you at the other side. transcript of communications between cc and lm resumed f i apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription"
okay.
"okay. i've got both canisters, al, both bat- teries. as soon as i get them in here, i got to pack the contingency sample."
cap ...
"okay, houston. we have a sticky talkback, red, on system a, quad 4. and it went gray with a tap."

"good show. okay, jim. you ready with the cir- cuit breakers? 02 23 37 15 i2_{p yes."
"ok_r. stand by a second. o100 53 20 cc ok_r, ken. go on, then, with your procedure."
that was a y.
"looks like your up-link's a little weak, hank; we're down - we're getting a lot of scratchiness."
see that? yes. two little squares.
"we've done it. oh, we've missed it."
"bat relay bus, open, al? 10 04 34 33 imp it's open."
help me take this - clip off. i can hold that. okay.
"that ain't good enough from past experience, is what you're saying?"
"that's a pretty good idea, putting that foil over there. 04 22 h8 59 cdr hey. ai_ let me check the s-band."
"nope. well, i found how to get up. lm/o-eva did you fall down?"
"well, that's all right. we can't x-rate the trans- cripts, so we'll just have to take - take it easy."
yeah.
okay.
mine's okay.

"i think our humidity must be running fairly high. 04 10 21 37 _p i_m passing over a nice little guy right aow and would guess - on, i haven't been paying any attention to where i am - looks like i must be - probably looking the the north at - somewhere around the - guts - gutenberg uplands. _d i'm passing over a little crater that's got another large fill in the center and nice big crater in top of him, a l_ttle crater chain around it. and as i said earliest, eveltthir¥_ out h_re has this linear pattern £r these linestlents and iv doesn't matter whether it's a flat surface, a ilorizontal, verti- cal_ inside of a wall of a crater - they all seem to have it in one form or another."

"tony, that's - this crater is about - i'd say, at least 200 meters across, has no rim, and no blocks associated with it, except for rays."
somehow i copied the wrong one.
roger.
"tvc serv0 power, ac 1."
that's about right.
"apollo 13, houston. request low bit rate, please. over."
"yeah. okay. i'll start - recorder is off; ... to do that; vox sensitivity to max; and i'm coming down the steps; cb configuration. make sure your visor's down, john."
roger. i think i have that. (eagle)
"you might be interested to know that i don't (tranq) think we notice any difficulty at all in adapting to one-sixth g. it seems if_ediately natural to move in this environment. 04 07 03 h7 cc roger, tranquility. we copy. over."
"okay, i wasnrt trying to hurry you, i just wanted to toss in a little reminder there."
let's take this one right here.
in in about a minute.
wait a minute. let me tell you which one. one of these - -
"okay, houston. you're looking at noun 85, and the ns is minus 3.3."
roger; we copy.
"that's good. 0h_ man, go slow."
"odyssey, houston. over."
you gave me that waste water dump at 199:40 or 45?
roger.
"we all felt like old hands the second time around, though."
okay.
"houston, apollo 17."
"it starts - well, the first one's at 5 minutes and then we go 6:40 and every l0 seconds after that. okay?"
"that's probably the best place in the world for the flag, is right up on the top."
get her in the ...
"(laughter) i can - yes, i bet."
"roger - 17, we're going to lose you in about bo seconds. but when you get over the stateside here, we're going to take - take the dump on the data, and we'll read it out real carefully so when you get in tlc we ought to be able to see where that master alarm glitch is coming in to."
this the third y?
"a 3, 2, 1 -"
bet there's glass in the bottom of that one.
splendid.
"question number 1. since last week, we have shared scores of exciting moments with you. which single moment would you most like to live again, and is there any moment which you would never like to repeat?"
"you going to get on, jack, or walk back? dealer's choice."
"hank, as we came up towards the landing site, in that terrain - the general terrain to the east of us appears to me to be frothy vesicular-looking type terrain, real ... looking at this scale. over."
...
"and, jack, you're going to be on the biomed tonight? whose side are you on? of course, i am. bob, i'm hooking up right now. i sort of rested my - my own personal sensors and i'm putting the mechanical ones on - electrical ones, i guess."

okay. tape 84_15
same.
roger.
mark it. got a barber pole.
"roger, dave. copy that. and that is exactly the answer we were after; not necessarily those partic- ular craters, but craters similar to them; and we understan_ exactly what you're saying. we'd like to ask, was the abundance of white and light-gray rocks described in the vicinity of - of falcon the same seen along the entire route to st. george, or did this abundance of white and light-gray rocks seem to vary? over."
a little darker.
"charlie, that - charlie - i was thinking of white mantle. that's the white mantle we're coming up on right up here."
okay; safe the pyros.
"so that being the case, i'm going to go ahead and start the - start the timer."
"guess we're cleared to go down and get the old - the old lunar sounder cassette, huh?"
"okay, thank you."
...
suit compressor 2 to ici.
"okay, dave. did you get that? delta-v thrust a and b, two of them, to normal right after the pro at the flashing 99?"
you might put - what are you going to put the big rock in? that might go in the scb.
stand by 1.
"okay, we're down to about - oh, 60 percent of the frame, i guess."
and. plus 10 and 260.
go ahead.
we catalog all of that on the entry stowage.
you ought to be looking right at ***
good night.
"endeavour, houston. how do you read?"
"roger; copy. 76, 58, 55, and 12. thank you guys. give us a call when you're ready for sleep, and we'll tuck you in."
"10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, flashing 99 to pro, 2, 1 -"
"how about that, baby."
"here you go, al. there. okay. good."

"oh, about 16 - 15-1/2."

"what's it look like? if it doesn't look worthwhile stopping, i'll move on up over there."
okay. discriminator's in high.

"drop back around, i think, i hope."
that's right.
"hello, houston; this is 17."
"okay, ken. and to let you know what's going on here, we were going to give you a tei-54 pad, and they're jockeying around - and - because of the plane change. and the plane change is gonna come _bout 169 hours. so they're gonna give you a tei-48 pad now, and give you a tei-55 pad at about 164 hours. so this'll be tei-48, sps/g&n; 38620; plus 0.59, plus 1.25; 168 - -"
"i'm not sure i can do that, but i'll give it a try."

"orion, this is houston. could you stand by i minute, please."

"15, houston. we'd like to have auto on the high gain and go from reacq to auto quickly."
"okay, joe. say again your - rake requirement. they're different from others?"
"joe, it feels like the - the rear steering, when i turn it off, doesn't center. feels like my rear wheels are drifting. so i guess i better turn it back on."
"yes, sir. we certainly do and they worked real hard to get the - these experiments and the equip- ment all squared away. i was following along with them pretty well and i had lot of confidence. 07 11 09 29 nasa well, very good. thanks kindly. cml° yes, sir. dr. fletcher; appreciate it."
"okay, back to work."
go ahead.
that's affirmative.
"okay. connect the - okay. now in - audio circuit breakers closed. now, both panels, vha - vhf a, receive; b, off. okay. mode ics/ptt. 05 o1 46 g1 cdr-i_4 hello, houston. do you read challenger on lm corem?"
"okay, coming up and over. take it around real easy. okay, now. i've got to get over there against the hamper."
you want -
"orion, this is houston. read you loud and clear."
okay. tallyho. tallyho.
"try opening up the f-stop all the way and exercis- ing the zoom. 04 20 10 05 l_ i sure will. boy, we sure don't want to touch those cables."
okay. the - all right - read me the steps.
"els, auto."
"al, we can have pan camera power, off, now. 06 01 52 01 cml° okay. pan camera power, off."
stand by. i'll check on that.
"okay. we've been writing them all down, vance, as we went, but that one turned out to be 29."
okay; that's - okay. we couldn't get an estimate.
it was good down here.
"okay. recorder, on."
i don't have any idea.
you're - you've come loose on the - you've come loose on the right. t_mp-eva yes. take a picture for you.
"and the note there is - use the - use the lexan shield on cm-5; in other words, leave it on the window."
"lfow are you doing today, philip?"
are they? 04 17 43 45 _p yes.
"yes. i reckon nothing's perfect. okay, they're closed."
loo.
yes. it's amazing.
that was only after insertion.
okay. i'm on - -
mark it. we heard it.
"yes, you do. they're down in this pocket, right there."
"okay, all the talkbacks are still gray, houston. it's pitching around now."
"okay. during the - the - suit donning went okay - in fact, pretty easy until we got to the part of zip - john and i zipping up. and in my suit in the lm, zipping up, john had an extremely difficult time getting the - the restraint zipper closed across the small of my back. it was extremely tight; the only way he was able to do it, was to zip the restraint - the restraint zipper in the front first, so that the zipper would line up a little bit better, and then he got the back part closed. now the only thing that worries me is that the suit, to me, felt like i'd grown an inch or two, and it was tight in the legs, and i didn't have the lcg on. and with the lcg and everything else, it might have built up where it would have been really bad, and we were wondering if it might be possible to - if you guys would let us let the legs out on this suit maybe a half an inch to an inch. over."
go ahead.
"we've been needing something to keep cool, i'll tell you."
roger. that's 31.0. we're smiling.
"well, i'll go lower if i could get an a plus. but i am going to accept an a minus, because i'll never get the wrench on it if i go any lower."
1510 feet per second.
"man, am i going to get dirty. hold it, now. back up a little ways .... tell me if it's clear of the porch rail, huh?"
"i'll take a break while you photo, dave. probably a good idea."
"... is over here. houston, 13."
"eagle, housto n. we didn't have them on the downlink but we copied them on the vox."
"you parked right in a crater, for me. that's good, now."
"okay. it goes up and then it goes back down again. don't ask me how the head compensates for it, because - the sinuses, i don't see how they can ever drain .... doctors ... it doesn't know it can't compensate."
looks good.
"okay. 111:57:30.09; plus 0070.5, plus all zeros, minus four zeros 5."
okay. we're just about there.
"okay. gainstep, shield off, at 236 and stand by for your cue for retraction."
okay.
"no, i've been trying that. 0_ 04 08 22 i_mp houston, orion."
"dave, this is houston. jim's feed water pressure is a little high. we wonder if you can - are in a position to - to see water coming from his sublimat or. over."
"that was - we reacquired with a ground station here. it was a - a switch here, ken. and there's nothing wrong with the good ship casper."
"say again. you want us to turn off battery 2, and leave it off until you look at it?"
"hey, tony. down about a- a centimeter or less, it's all white."
copy al. very interesting.
"okay, mark on, and let's take the map camera_ on switch to standby and the map camera, image motion, off."
"now, spacecraft control to cmc."
"well, that's worse."
"11, houston. on your auto rcs select switches, we show quad bravo disabled but quad charlie only partially disabled. charlie 3, i believe, is the only one you have selected off. is that correct?"
"houston, 16. we're in orion now. you've got the coremon; you should be getting high bit rate moment arily."
"s_y again, neil. over."
"the trash bag's done untied itself. o0 08 03 oh cmp yeah, i ainyt sure that's going to be an acceptable solution. i'm afraid i - maybe we ought to use one of those tsbs after all. let's try that."
"okay. and if you've got something - if you don't have one left for that sample at hole-in-the-wall, jack, we'd like you to get a new set of sample bags."
- - and we'll do it again.
roger. copy 1 psi.
"gene and jack, we're still marveling at the _ _l- tiful television pictures that we're getting from your tv camera there. it's fun, in fact, to watch the - the tracks that you're leaving behind in - in the - the lunar soil, both footprints and rover tracks. and some of us are down here now reflect- lug on what sort of mark or track will someday disturb the tracks that you leave behind there tomorrow."
"ah, no, sir. i got that down here at 165:27. 06 21 1! 04 cc okay. i didn't know whether you'd gotten that change or not. okay. we'll go by that. we want to delete the orbital science for this rev, so you can delete that little line there at about 165:18 where it says prepare. amd at 165:30 at the top of the next page, delete pan cbj_era mode, standby, and power, on. and down at 165:35, delete the pain camera power, off, msfn cue. okay. let me update your times, here. at 165:31, where it says _,iassspec, retract, to 20 feet, the new re- traction time is 33 seconds. and at 165:35, retract to 15 feet. the new retraction time is 30 seconds. 06 21 12 16 c_ and that 30 seconds is - is starting from where i stopped at 165:30. okay?"
"okay, sounds good."
"okay, pull it out as back - far as we can?"
"the horizon will be about - well, i've already missed the horizon. okay."
"yes, we think it'd be a lot of help."
front flap secure. okay. you're locked.
"we copied, charlie."
let me jot down your recommendations again. say _- again.
"good morning, jack."
nothing in u-2 like that. that's where it was.
yes. you'd better believe that.
"i'm going to throw it by the pallet. 06 05 53 39 lmp-t_m okay, babe, you got two rocks - two scbs and an etb to come up. you could probably load the -"
"no, no problem."
"hey, man. we could just go, babe. i'm really cinched into this - moose."
"repress package, off."
okay. looks good. just be careful you don't move it any closer to the right side of your plss and bump it.
"yeah. okay. here's a small secondary up here on top of the - of the - of the rim. it's about a meter across, about a meter deep, and it has either angular - very angular black clasts or part of this black rock in total. and they must be - they must be 4 or 5 centimeters across in there, and i'll get one or two of those babies. 06 23 12 02 l_p-eva hey, john. can i get a bag from mou?"
"he's good. he says to tell you that you make a dandy spectrographer - for x-rays, that is. he's getting a lot of data in. i guess, actually, a little more activity than they expected, and they seemed real pleased about that. ---"
"okay. i can go it, i'm right here."
we're not - we're not sure. we kind of think that may be what 's happening.
"orion, this is houston with a late change to your time line at t. minus 2. zg"
"okay; it's 58.0 in the range counter. okay; test 4. she's counting down, and trace went down. going straight along."
"yes, we'll go south of that."
why don't you write them right in here?
"hey, charlie boy, looking good here. that was a beautiful burn. they don't come any finer."
okay. how is the ranging check going?
"okay, houston; we'll sep at 4:18."
"no. no .... 03 04 58 51 cml:' houston, 16."
"well, it doesn't look any different, though, to the eye - halfway down."
"roger. it looks that way to us, charlie. 04 04 09 06 _ okay."
not yet.
okay; copy.
okay.
"roger. yes, it does."
yes. z know. i heard you.
"no, i've got it here."
all it means is that we don't yet know the origin of the dark mantle.
that's one that was there from last time.
"okay. the cowboy-redskin game just got started. it's now 7 to nothing, cowboys. they scored the first time they got their hands on the ball. lamp okay. i think we got most of that. it happened again, though."
"now, wait a second, pete. let me back up a little better."
great! right on.
"0keydoke, stand by a minute."
roger. keep saying those words. the people on my left appreciate that.

okay. let's just make sume we don't get any dirt down there on it. 05 13 58 30 _p okay. we'll walk real slow. -ftdent
"of course, a little cloud from up here probably covers 8 or 10 states."
"16, houston. how do you read?"
"37, 38, 39, 40, 41- -"
"and charlie, could you go ahead and - -"
"we copy. ir, on. over."
"roger, al. i've got what they tell me is the last change to your flight plan to put you back on the nominal."

might be able to see whether that's flush enough - before we dock.
"okay, joe, we got the water warning light."
"dave and jim, could you check the suit connector, please?"
"okay. copy that, geno. and how about giving me amp-hours and batteries just as long as you're there?"
"okay. we have that too, jack."
that's enough.
"okay, houston. i'm going to torque those cos - coarse align errors out at l, 2."
"okay. gig us again in a few minutes. we're breaking out some food, and we'll copy them then."
"if he is, tell him - if he is, tell him we - 64 charlie just topped the mount whitney event."
"okay, we'll try to put it in the center of the three craters to get all three - well, to get whatever stratigraphy we have here. and the last fillets - picture, shadow 9 o'clock - was 18."
what is it - what are we going to see with him rolling like that?
"houston, what site have you got on that ...?"
"okay. i have a question for you, houston, if you have time,"
"sure. 05 22 27 14 l_ okay. i need verb 16. could be noun 86 is - okay. 250, plus 00621, enteri; _51, plus - 452, plus 00631, enter."
i just put this on.

"okay, mike. and could you verify that your waste compartment valve is in vent, tlere?"
wait a minute. get the safety locked.
okay. jack. are you happy with the amps we have now?
"oh, bob, you're a beauty. how did you think of that?"
it's about zero.
"wait, wait, wait a minute."
"oh, and we got a picture."
"okay, here's number 9. one, two, and she's fully released; the hook clears the docking ring. okay, number 10. here's one, two - fully released, and the hook clears the docking ring. there's one ... okay, handle's free; j-hook clears the ring. i've only got one more to go. there's the first latch there's two latches ... came over. and the hook stays clear; the handle is free. and, by golly, they're all off. hey, challenger; america. you're hanging on those three little bitty things. okay. i put the old - hatch in."

do you want to just take those numbers?
"okay, thank you very much."
"okay, do you guys still have a closure rate? do i still have a closure rate? okay. looks like the old ems is just sort of sitting here looking at itself."
yes. they are ...
yes.
"(laughter) yes. the dump is off; so if we get one, it'll be soon. now, let - is there anything you want me to check down here? let me look around one last time. see if you see anything floating around. 03 11 11 16 _ i don't see anything."

"go ahead, vance. 01 1i 27 07 cc jim, just an item for you _md fred to be thinking about in case you haven't been briefed on this, something that's now being talked about a little bit. these conservative people would like to have you read the she tank pressure when you go into the lm for the lm familiarization at 58 hours. if there's no midcourse-3, and it looks like there's a good chance that there will not be, why, they might want to move the lm familiarization up from 58 to 55 hours. over."

roger.
"they're kind of interesting. they're all moving ... and sparkling there. and i can ... - at least i think i can what will occasionally give you a real star from the bunch of sparklies, but it really does break up the capability to pick out a star pattern, particularly through ..."
look at that. that ...
"that's affirmative, 16. i believe that covers everything."
"... field, not this block but there's sort of a collection of them - -"
"would you believe i'm out of film, bob?"
that's right. it was all - all a good ride.
"you're going to have some time - oh, you got to get your suit on."

"no. okay, go to cmc, auto. okay, now we want to maneuver to another point there: midpoint attitude, flight plan. 08 04 00 05 imp midpoint. i understand."
roger. all we are trying to do is get pgns and ags aligned together. doesn't make any differ- ence on the gimbal angle.

"okay, i'm going to go ahead and get my - no, i'll wait - until i get the computer."
"... get an answer. l0 o0 33 26 cml° okay, hank. when we go into number 6 procedure, we come down and the logical answer out of block 2 is that the - the - you can reset the program lights, and the iss light goes off all on its own; it's only on for a very short period of time. and that says that the transient condition stops. i guess we could take a look at - going down through the ""no"" path and try a block 6, but i'd like to have some concurrence on that before we do it."
okay.
"we can now, i think, see contrast down in the shadow. and the only part of the scarp that is visible - i think jack picked it out - as being right where lara is."
just as soon as we get this thing down real iow.
"houston, columbia. (columbia)"
"and, ken. just for your info, the field geology team are in the final phase of making their plans for eva-2 tomorrow. so, if you've got any addi- tional comments, why, better make them this - this pass because they'll have to have it all firmed up. _"

"okay. tli: 2 plus 26 plus 05, 179, 105, 000, 5 plus 47, 10416.9, 35587, 358, 139, 320, 302, 319, 040, and ejection time, 4 plus 01 plus 00."
"yes, i see what you are talking about. come on down here and let's get a frag off of one of these -_ boulders and then we'll head on back to the rover."
"... as far as keeping an eye on us, you guys would rather be outside than inside, wouldn't you?"
"don't forget, jack; you'll have to stow my antenna yet."
"okay, ken. you're getting a line-of-sight rate. you're going to have to thrust a little toward the moon."
wait a minute; i'm deploying it.
"roger. _ yes, i take that back. that's the side of - that's the side of the command module we're look- ing at that has the little blisters on it. got to get oriented up here. got a great view of the hatch - you ... watch your eyes and everything. look up, rather than into the sun ..."
sec.
okay. it sounds good.
"hey, hold that, jack."
yes. it's all alined. we're all ... - -
"okay. i'll just verify it, then."
you really got to be careful when you go out of the light into the dark.
go.
"no, it's a - the refsmmat flag is still set. 10 00 29 44 cml° we can check all those - -"
mark cdr.
"okay, and you want us to do that about 80 - 83:30, huh?"
"bob, i am continually impressed by the lack of exotic fragments in here."
"boy, you ought to see the down-sun, down - oh, look at underneath the rock! we got to roll it over and get some of that too. underneath the rock is, looks like, either glass bubbles or vesicles; i can't tell which because it's in the shadow."
"okay; rate high and max deadband is okay, but g&c tells me you really - that the deadband - you don'% need to go to max, it's - it's kind of immaterial which position you put the switch in. you do need the rate switch in high, and you need b_g mode, rate 2. that way you don't have an attitude con- trol situation. you have a rate control situation, but the level is high enough that it's well above the orb rate, and so the scs will be equivalent to going cmc, free."
"well, we won't be able to talk to dumis again."
for 3 you're ready for 02.
"bob, don't let me forget to bring a dustbrush back when i come .... - -"
"the second backpack is mounted down on the lm floor, i hope, positioned right between the two of us. i have my hand on it at this time. tape 36/(i pace 153"
"by-by, houston. i got to go pee again. t"
"yes, i thought it was."

"roger, jack. and the next one is over at 89:03. we've got a comm attitude."
"okay, dave. tap the amp-hour meters just to see if the readings change."
yeah. they're just opposite of what we're looking at.
okay. (tranq ) #** three asterisks denote clipping of words and phrases. ((;0_jznet 1) tape 70/9
"roger; ken, and good work."
yeah.
"houston, 13. are you still on tv?"
pete? pete.
"yes, that's ... yes. yes...."
it's over the handrail now.
there's biac_ material - now - get on up here - you get on up here_ the darker tannish-gray material covers essentially from the east all the way around to the south. it goes outside the rim as well as inside the rim_ it drapes over the rim. that can't be a shadow effect°
"ro - gene, say again. you were way down in the mud on that one. can you say again, please?"
sock me a pill. is there any left?
"yes, sir."
okay. understand the needles are nulled.
rover sample.
negative.
no.
"and we're asking because we may have a chilly battery on our hands. we've got good tv picture, but the voltage is not quite up to par."
maybe it's part of a ... or something like that.
"a little of ""with their eyes on the stars"" to wake up to. g1 22 47 24 cc sounds like all the comforts of home. have you guys got a flower on your breakfast table?"
"stand by a minute; we'll check it. okay, 16; you can go ahead with the maneuver now."
okay.
okay. you're just about right on.
okay. we got to close the primary h20. 05 06 o1 47 cdr-iai okay.
"roger. and the people down here are suggesting that on your presleep checklist, we omit the direct 02 to on for the rest of your solo flight because you aren't just breathing down the cabin that much, and i guess it will save a little bit of oxygen and eliminate the possibility of crack- ing a relief valve there. so we'll delete that section from your -"
sample in sample bag ... - the numbers.
"now, that's a good bagfull."
"i - z - did you get the - oh, you're looking for the cue cards, is that right?"
there she comes.
can't see it?
"okay. gimbal motors, pitch 2, got it. yaw 2, got it. okay; got a little trim. plus 0.4 .... okay. tvc to tvc, tvc to tvc. looking good."
roger.
"that's affirmative. and if i can pull one of you guys away from a window, i've got a tli plus 90 pad. oh, i'd love to copy that. just a minute. 00 01 41 29 i24p hello, houston; apollo 17. how do you read ?·"
got a lot of glass.
"apollo 11, apollo 11, this is houston. do you read? 0vet. 00 03 27 5h cc apollo 11, this is houston. radio check. over."
okay. the lmp has entered the lm.
i'm sorry. do you want to try putting it in the bag?
"boy, i'll tell you, this regolith is - is - is about a inch deep here in most places. it's - there's just lots of rocks under this stuff, tony. this is a - tells me it's - - 07 00 01 _7 cc that's really interesting. you know i didn't expect that."
we tore that son of a bitch apart and finally got it fixed; god d_mu.
"yeah, i ought to - i'll be quiet here and let you concentrate on your eating."
"the shadows are right here coming across albategnius. they're pretty well cleared out. you just get the shadows from the very big peaks. at ptolemaeus, it's almost completely clear of shadows. alphonsus still has some. i can pick out the crater chain now. it's just now getting out of the shadow, and, sure enough, there is a great big little ridge that lays across the front of it that's been masking it all this time. the floor of ptolemaeus looks to be like all the rest of the cayley material. it's got a great deal of craters as you can see from the pictures. i would say the preponderance of them are rimless. as they get a little larger, they start to form with a - very - a very subtle rim, so i guess i can't say that they're all rimless. there is one, looks like a fracture, about in the middle, and it may be a scarp that's caused by a fracture, or it may be a flow pattern. 05 04 16 51 cml° and as we come upon davy chain, it appears that they do have - they don't each have an individual rim. there is mottled material in this area, and i'm going to try and get that magazine. i think you need to see this. can you give me the settings for the - so we can take a picture of this real fast."
okay.
haven't got up to ... on it. how about giving me a rundown?
"yes, i could do that now, i guess, couldn't i?"
"roger. well, we'll do that."
"right at the moment anyway. right at the moment anyway, is to be out there and watching this space- craft maneuver in attitude and - and watch it burn over the lunar surface. i get the feeling someone is watching."
okay. i'm going to have to get off comm here; i'll let jack get the headset.
okay.
"roger; that's correct, fred. if you'll take out a maneuver pad, i'll give you some landing information. over."
okay. battery b relay's breakers in. charger's off.
"yes, i can get it. okay. okay. cml° okay?"
just slightly north of contact [?].
"be advised, houston, that when i select - i've got the angles set in: a plus 26; yaw, minus 12. we are in attitude, and when i select s-band to slew, the signal strength just slowly drifts off. over."
"okay. looking back towards stone mountain, tony - - 06 05 23 2h cdr-eva charlie, let me park the i2q right here."
let me take a look at yours.
okay; i'll get the sesc now - -
roger. standing by for t-stop.
and we want to get that prior to that cm/lm pres- sure equalization decal.
"bob, we'll take another 0ps check later on when we stow them. we're pressing on. okay; we want to - what 's next ?"
"yes, why don't you rewind it right now; then we're in good shape."
"okay, 11 minutes."
ten seconds.
"approximate size, dave. 05 02 30 53 ia{p-eva oh, i see a- oh, there's a- another fresh one over there at about - ll o'clock."
"okay. we're just coming up on albategnius and klein now. boy, i wish we could get a couple more of those - forward oblique photo passes. that was the one time when the windows were really pointing in the direction you'd like to have them. other than that, you have a permanent crick in your neck."
roger.
"well, there may be nothing down there except some cloud patterns and - but that's all i can see, of course. the front that's south of australia now - i presume front - just looking at a fairly well-developed, although narrow, cloud line, is about 5 - about 10 degrees south of perth right now, southwest of perth and runs on a northwest- southeast line - over to a point about 10 or 15 degrees southwest of tasmania. and then it intersects a curved front that runs from there up to - to tasmania, and then back around down south of new zealand about 10 degrees."
got.
"okay; i was just going to update that. the cowboys won it 34 to 24. and by winning it, they wrap up the wild-card slot in the nfc; and so both wash- ington and dallas will be in the playoffs. 02 18 56 5b cdr sounds good."
ail right. here's one right here.
"going straight to the floor, which is just - -"
"yeah. okay. okay. let's see if i can reiterate what happened. as soon as i turned it on, we got an undervolt. didn't happen to see how much it was?"
"that's the - halo is this first one right here, the little one, and then all those others are next over, according to the chart."
"well, i'm min dead band, but i maneuvered out of attitude. you want to go back to regula_ attitude?"
affirmative. plus 15 and a plus 185. 10 21 42 05 imp okay.
ail set.
do you believe it's cold up there?
"okay. verify, verify, verify. circuit breaker wiped out plus eva decals."
i found that line.
"you're loud and clear now, and let's go to panel 5. we want fuel cell pump ac 1, off; ac 2, off; and that's the fuel cell 1 pump, ac 1, off; fuel cell 2 pumps, ac 2, 0ff; fuel cell b pumps, ac 2, 0ff; g/n power, off, and both the main bus ties off. over."
a 1-1/2-inch hole visible in the upper left-hand corner of the upper panel?
"no, i'm doing fine."
"no, let me do a p - p30-p41 real quick and get you to - the right attitude."
"three minutes, and we are go."
"okay. ed, as you may have noticed during the eva and, in fact, during the predepressurization check- list, your suit leak rate seems to be somewhat higher than al's, although wit?lin the spec. at this time, we'd like you to rurlthrough the normal pressure integrity check on your suit/plss combina- tion as called out at the 52-minute mark prior to depress on the eva-1 card. a1 can proceed to re- configure himself onto the lm _ecs. over. 04 22 29 51 i_,_p **_ you go ahead. the i'll just *_* - -"

okay. i'll help you.
okay.
what we gonna do with it? put it on - -

"wait a minute. i got to get the tapes, john. i want to make sure i got everything. okay, pull left pin, pull reel, pull saddle release. okay. here's the saddle release coming down ... outstanding!"
doesn't it look like caliche?
"good core, joe. 06 00 38 15 i_mp-eva i like those cores like that."
"are you happy with that, bob? i'm - roll indicator is indicating - make it 3 degrees right - 3 degrees right."
that just call a noun 20?
"i couldn't see it ... on the picture, but - yeah, i think - -"
roger.
"okay, i have the contingency sample. i'm taking it back to the ladder."
pm.
i'll get a locator from here.
"roger, 15. go ahead."
"joe, mag romeo has 21 frames. and i took a few, random, and probably not very good 500-millimeter of the north and south massifs - north and south massifs."
"yes, it is. isn't it? how come we saw the same planet in the sunlight, jim? huh? tell me that. 00 02 09 41 cml° ..."
"- - our next request is two undocumented 6-inch blocks, and then we'll want you on the rover driving north."
"*** i didn't get you a - i didn't get you a pendu- lum, but i don't know where i would, bob. okay. i'm going to have to take you out to the vip site, if you concur?"
94:20:20.
"jim, we're happy with that; no problem."
"... 05 14 35 33 lm_-lm gordy, you've implied that we may be a little behind on water. is that correct?"
(sound of camera running)
does that refer to the pages?
"okay, i think we've got you now, 17."
"light flash, what's all that junk, ..."
"i'm kind of guessing it is. it may be another - yes, there it is- 15-degree inclination. i just always imagined it was right in front of us."
glad something's working. 00 02 35 19 omp really got to be careful you don't move the wrong switch ... switch ...
"- - a couple minor things on the back-side check- out. the secondary glycol pump, when i started it, the sound and the pressure was ragged, oscillated around - 20 psi, and then stabilized. after about 15 seconds, it sounded smooth. it had a sound as if it was cavitating a little bit; but, after that, it was smooth. over."

i'll give you a hack when you're within range of the lm.
"okay. and while you're working there, dave, you did such a beautiful job on fixing jim's plss antenna, we're - we've got another walter mitty repair job we'd like for you to carry out for us? please_ on the cable lead from the high gain antenna to the lcru, and when you think you're at a good place to do that, i'll go through a description of what we need."
roger.
roger. stand by.
"roger. copy, eagle. out."
"- - into gatsby, because it looks like the mantle stream_ over the - the side from the southwest. can you swing to your right - get up a little closer to the rim, there?"
okay; copy that.
"okay. well, that would help. that's better than this thing."
"fred-o, we've got one more change we'd like to give you to clarify a question that jack asked earlier. at ei minus 02'30 - -"
what did you do?
"yeah, there he is."
yes.
i'm john. (laughter) that's yours.
and we're about ready to los; we'll see you at hawaii.
"and whenever jim's ready to do the targeting, we'll read him a pad on that."
183:45. okay.
... okay.
_gine arm is off.
look at all those swirls.
"okay, ken. how do you read?"
okay. one thing we do need. did you weigh your isa? and we need a weight on it_ please.

that is correct.

"okay, but i might just as well stay in scs. that's a simpler - and one less number that i'm likely to confuse."
let's hope it works (laughter). keep it coming.

"you want to stow that, ken? with the food in it?"
"roger; thank you. it's going to be line 9 to the end of your checklist, plss recharge procedures, and i'll read them to you if you want, i have them _-_ right here."

"okay, can you stand by just a minute, please?"
"i've got one small comment for you, and then a small update to the flight plan. first of all, they've init - they've gone through a fairly f thorough test on the range rate meter and how it operates under those pressures and in that pure oxygen atmosphere, and so far as we can see at the present time, there is no problem whatever in its operation, but we'll continue that test. in the flight plan at 60 hours on the - on the sim bay procedure to get some data from the cameras there, i have a small change, if you have the flight plan out."
"go ahead, sir."
okay.

don't work too hard.
yes.
"that's correct, and up telemetry, com_f_d reset to reset and then normal."

"okay, dick, i got 45.3 feet per second."
"okay, al. fine. that - that was the problem; we didn't get this morning's report. one other quicky. if you'll comment if we're throwing too many reminders up from the ground here or not enough. we're just trying to get a feel for whether we're harassing you or helping you - on the timing callouts."
roger. agree.
"yeah, wait a minute."

"okay, g&n power ac on panel 5 comes off."
i guess i'm getting a little concerned about that minus-x i put in there.

a couple of them look fairly coarsely crystalline. okay. put these in there.
"okay, and, i guess, so you don't get confused, that means we'll be bringing back both cameras."

does that bother you?
"houston, do you want us to tilt that package - that rtg package is okay with dirt on its floor, isn't it? does it need to be all white? _05 01 03 24 cc okay, we'll work that. no, it doesn't have to be all white."

"okay, falcon; reading you. we have a lot of noise on the loop - maybe it'll go away in a moment."
that's affirm. we haven't gotten that kit out yet.
okay. a lot of happy people down here with nothing to ask you.
"tha%'s affirmative. aha the last update is on the next page - 184:27. and it says ""_uipping camera, retract"" and since we didn't extend it you don't have to retract it. c_2_ sounds logical. okay, mapping camera, delete the ""m_ipping camera, retract."""

"yes.... you can see, bigger than shit."
"and, and, and - i mean he was watching the red and white to see if it was taking a picture, and we noticed that we - after we got done, all the 500-millimeter stuff that - we knew we had taken approximately 100 pictures, but the counter only read 60. and we kicked that around for quite a while, and we finally concluded that because a1 had been watching, that there was something wrong with the counter and we really had taken all the pictures. so we decided that we'd use up the rest of that film on targets of opportunity. and while a1 was taking the pictures out the window, the side of the magazine just popped off_ right out of nowhere, for no reason, and it opened up about one-eighth of an inch and al tried to jam it back on and he had to actually open the lock and put it back on."
okay.
"boy, there's big fragments out here."
"okay. that's a good idea. here, jim, i'm going to bring her around here and let's get on with it."
yep.

"oh, there you are, i thought maybe you fell in that crater i'm looking at. okay. i'm going to give you a tge reading."
"roger, buzz. i think i've got the picture. you indicate that little difference between the two samples and that in each case you got down about 2 inches without any problems and then had to continue hammering rather vigorously in order to continue driving it in to a total depth of 8 or 9 inches, and even at that point the rods did not want to stay vertical, that they'd tend to fall over on you even after pounding in that far. is that correct?"
"suit circuit relief, auto. fidential."
yeah. flml mt 4
"okay, gordy. while you're - while you're waiting on that go, i had to - i - i shot for a spot, around 2 o'clock from poppy. there's a number of boulders out at 12 o'clock from poppy, and i really think i'm probably not more than about 100 meters out in front of it - and slightly to the north. actually, i may be a little bit closer to trident than i expected poppy to be. i - i think i've got trident right out the left window. aud our first cut at the mobility around here in the rover. it ought to be super."

okay. the pressure's okay?
"hey! you know, you'll never believe it. i'm right over the edge of orientale. i just looked down and saw a light flash myself."
"that's the way it should be, 16. and - -"
that's real good now.
"woul_ you pull our wetpacks out of there, babe?"
"okay. now we're spinn2ng it with the pgns, what you gave us for a pgns attitude. is this the wrong one? do you want me to just to aline up the earth as i did before in the last midcourse?"

"we'd like - we noticed the mixing valves cycling about once every 10, 15 seconds. we'd like to give you a mark, at which time we want you to put the glycol evap temp in valve in manual and try to catch the flow rate at a - at a appropriate setting. i'll - i'll give you kind of a countdown and a mark here."
that's enough.
go ahead. } i
"well, this ridge system is running east and west down here. the color boundary isn't nearly as apparent in crisium as it is in serenitatis. ex- cept that right under me right now there's kind of a subdued crater-type thing and with a southern part of a ridge. the ridge runs east - west, and it looks like we've got a flow coming out of it. let me see if i can get a quick picture of that one. well, lost my camera (laughter). here it is. oh, it's too late; it's gone now. you know some- thing, you see this subsolar point, it's kind of - zero phase - zero phase point, i mean, is following me right along out here in crisium, so i get a different color straight out from the window than i do out from the edge of it. so i think that's going to influence my thinking."

yes.
"(laughter) well, this is really a sporty driving course. man, oh, m_u, what a grand prix this is!"
"man, there sure is a lot of things up here that i don't understand. look at that big crater down south with the rocks in it. or - you - you're looking right at it. it's got layers of walls there."
okay. we got it.
"falcon, houston. you're coming through; we have a lot of static on the line and they're trying to clear it up now. you're way down in the mud."
"dave, that's more or less correct. i think we're satisfied with the alinement here. we just need some help on tilting our camera up to the level."

okay.
"okay, houston; 15. it looks like we got a good seal. how's it look down there?"
"but you can see patterns of what i believe is pack ice - leading off from that sharp interface that was talked about earlier. and those patterns seem to merge directly with the patterns of the clouds as if the - at least near the continent - the oceanic currents are controlling the air cur- rents, up to a point, along with the movement of the pack ice."

"well, if you need me off; jack, just punch it."
plus 045. i got them. give me the det and i'm ready.

bring that out of there! i can see why that's propulsive.
roger. the angles you got in the flight plan will he good when you get there.
"it must have pulled out on the geophone somehow. where did you pick it up, charlie?"
go ahead.
"- - free to rotate, so it wasn't even - it wasn't making a firm contact at all with the surface."
"okay, gordo; this is america. are you ready for the mapping camera?"
"roger. when you get back into your surface checklist and come over to the comm reconfigura- tion on page surface-45, we'd like you to enable the ranging feature on your s-band. that is, when you come down to s-band configuration, in- stead of caution and warning electronics, enable tv, we'd like you to go into the range position and leave it there for as long as you conveniently can until you get ready to commence yo_w rest period; and we'll try to get a little nore ranging data on you. over."

and give us a mark when you're going.
"oh well, yes, yes, that's right. and now as i think back i guess that's the main difference between the tan rocks at station 2 and station 6, but the ones at 6 appear to be - have an igneous texture or at least a very crystalline texture and inclusion-like masses of other rocks. where- as, the ones at station 2 they - they seem to be fragment breccias, as i recall. that's right, although they may have been recrystallized or metamorphosed, they were clearly breceias at station 2. i just forgot about that."
"okay, and your azimuth is 275, and the elevation is 66."

i hadn't - i didn't set it at all yet.

"yes, we assumed you did. i just was trying to cover all bases here. okay; the last three items - i think you've actually called one of them - are down in the lower equipment bay. one of them is the - the crack just below panel 101, down in the lower equipment bay. i think,you called that one the first night, didn't you?"
no.
"yep. okay; 600 to go. looking good. okay, ascent feeds are coming open."
"we'd like you to think about this control mode, jim, and see if you think it might work from what you know right now. we're a little skepti- cal, but we'd like to put it to you. so, once you get in a pretty good attitude, monitor in verb 16 noun 20, go to pgns minimum impulse, verb 76, as we have, and set up a yaw rate - yaw rate to the right. monitor the middle gimbal on tape 42/$ pmge 233 r3 on the dsky and see if she'll kind of stabilize out. if not, the only other suggestion we've got is to go to pgns attitude hold. we'll keep the ball up until you make this evaluation."

"and houston, eagle. are you going to use the high gain before you can look at our gda posi- tion indicator?"
"okay, jack. on this pass, the earth comte into the view at the top part of the inp's window, and we got an lpd angle on it as it passed through the cdr's window of a minus 4 degrees."
it's auto.
yes.
"okay. he wants my prd, even though it's the one that's not working, huh? 06 09 31 46 cc well - they - anything is better than nothing. 06 09 31 55 c_ i guess you're right. here's some torquing angles for you, bob. used stars _1 and _3. no_ 05 was _. plus four balls l; notw 93 _ plus 00028, minus 00031, plus all zeros. and it was torqued out at 152: 26:00."

"okay, karl. it'll be a while yet."
"roger, dave. we would like you to do a vfr burn, which means go - maneuver to a trailing position - and fire i foot per second retrograde. understand?"
i noticed that yesterday.
"okay, charlie. it's not open very far. it's hard to give you a good reading without shuntin_ it again, but the arrow is at about the one o'elock position. now i reduce the flow, and i'll let it stabilize here. right now our onboard read_nt_ is about 0.4, and that's with the arrow in thc 02 valve at the two o'clock position. would you rather have comparisons of 02 flow readings or would you rather have valve position c_mparisons?"

i'm there.
"the stuff is torn - a couple of _anels are torn off. and some of the stripping in between it is - it looks like it was struck by something, but it looks like all the _ylar blartets underneath are still intact."
very good.
"i think so, under the circumstances. you see, most of the rocks are - were dust covered apparently by the - by the two impacts, north ray and south ray. it had just thrown a big blanket of dust out across there, and we saw very few rocks that were clean un - until we cut into them. and you don't want to take too much time to stop and whack off a piece of rock, because it's pretty hard to do in a pressure suit. so we were just describing them more by shape and softness and friability and things like that. and that really doesn't take a lot of training, but i think we've had adequate training to do this kind of a job."
"okay, my suit power's going off - -"
okay.
"oh, here comes the sunshine. off to my window - pane."
yes.

we sure do.
but you - -
"i've got to put your - those samples in the src, in your bag; and we'll save this one, i guess."
roger.
"okay, cabin is still about 2-1/2; it's 0.25, al."
"roger. i am in auto dump and i'll - i'll have to wait until we get in daylight to go down there, i think. i show about full, but i guess it isn't. 04 05 0i 21 cc okay; we copy."
"jack, you look good to us."
"joe, how do you read me?"
"okay, thank you."
"now, let me get my side panels off."
"how much time do we have, gordo?"
"ah, we're going to the surveyor crater."
it's like a three-man gemini now.
"yes. jack, try a little higher. see that one right on the - right there. right - yes, that's a hard rock. ·-'"
we'd like to select omni bravo now.

feel around here.
okay.
"low gain_ gene, please; after you get stopped."
"if not, let's take them off and hold them."

and have we got the gravimeter back on the rover?
r:ger.
"roger, ron. good work."
"hello, houston; clipper."
"yes, that's all right. move right over here near your tire tracks."
you're just slightly shallow. give you a little softer ride.
"okay, 331."
"a_hhh, well, come on. (laughter) ... okay, vhere we go. - 0.1 to plus - well, keep the change. you can read it. press on."
okay. that'll save us some trouble.
"ridiculous, pete!"
"hadley base, this is houston. we're still showing the cabin gas return in cabin. could you reverify that it's in egress_ please. 06 18 20 52 i_p-lm cabin gas return is presently in auto. i think we pick it up at egress a little later on in the procedure."
"well, they gave me too much hot stuff."
and the big-rock bag's on the hand tool carrier. 06 21 49 4h cc okay.
"how busy are you, dick? how busy are you?"
"yes, that kind of matches up, jack. does it look like new guinea and that is pretty well clobbered?"
auto optics leads the target about a kilometer out into the cayley formation.
"go ahead, endeavour."
"yes. 03 22 06 05 _ yes; 33's not so had, except a -"
okay. okay; here's about 7 clicks. 06 20 43 05 i2_p-eva camera is on.
"as long as we're remaining active, why - as long as we're remaining active, why are we try- ing to damp the rates, tony?"
yurga! yaah!
it's up to you.
stand by.
"hey, john, i'm going to run on out and look at some of these angular ones out here."
"right, we're not doing anything right now, vm_ce, we're just getting curious, we could start the lm entry procedures, and get everything squared away, and then when the tv comes up at 55 hours, we can just use it for the tv, and we wouldn't be worrying about checking out the she tank pressures and everything like that."
"charlie, we'd like you to verify that you've got that camera pointed at the right one this time."
"down voice backup. we're on hot mike. 04 ll 26 12 i/_p-_ apparently, but, are we in down voice backup now? _ 04 ll 26 14 cdr-i_ good. turn it off."
"okay - unless you want to go do the drill. 06 04 12 49 i_mp-eva not at all, brother."
"apollo 16. our first batch of tracking data shows you right in the groove, and we're gonna get another hours' worth of data and then give you your final pad."
- - putting the collection bags on now?
"hey, i bet you we can put a couple of bags and a couple - helmets in the top of the pga bag."
"okay, i guess they're happy."
copy that.
go ahead.
"okay, and have at it. we - we'd like to have the tm up for about 5 or l0 minutes to look at the data from the cm; look at your temperatures, et cetera. and after that, we'll go back to charging the battery again, and the charge will probably go until around get 126."
yes.
"i don't know how far we could extrapolate that in other craters, but we might start trying a little bit."
"when i get down under the 12-inch layer, the surface is much harder - harder to dig through."
"roger. ts, 114 30 57; t9, 116 29 10; t10, 118 (tranq) 27 23; tll, 120 25 36; t12, 122 23 49. over."
"al, this is houston. reading you loud and clear."
"okay. and we've got a _rb 49 maneuver to geo x-1 and the attitude is 347, 071, and 000. the high gain is minus 36 and 176, and we'll open the alpha/x-ray cover."
they talked to us first.
"yes. i think we can get some more level spots. i can dust this thing back there. apollo 17 air-to-ground voice transcription 06 19 28 50 cml° oh, i hope we got a pan camera picture of that - what the - condorcet [?] or ... or something like that, the one i was describing had a little bit of diamond down in it?"
"we're going to have to go back to 226. it's just prior to where you go into ptc and pick up these fo_aritems, and then get into ptc."
okay.
... - -
use my pen.
"houston, how do you read?"
the second part of that question was: did you see any differences between cayley and descartes?
"apollo 11, this is houston. readback correct. for your information, goldstone reports receiv- ing approximately 1 minute of fm downlink car- rier. we were getting ready to request you confirm on the s-band aux switches, the s-band aux tape switch to off and the s-band aux tv switch to tv. over."
it's start.
"well, i'll tell you, i used it three or four times ... (laughter)."
roger; we'll get on it right away.
yes.
"we're digging out a map now, 16, to take a look at it."
"yeah, and it's filthy. get a little shovel - shovelful of that stuff."
"i guess the s-ivb vibration during tli was there all the time although it seemed to - to grow to us as the burn progressed, although that may have been just due to the boost weight decrease."
"it's in, and it stayed in."
standing by for the - -
"okay, that's great; and you can go shoot the solar wind, now."
"sounds like an interesting crater, in any case."
okay.
"seventy-one, minus 70."
"that ought to be good for a picture, huh?"
"okay, i turned around and looked at the cosmic ray."
on.
"no. i'll tell you what. there aren't any scarps there at all. that's why - that's another thing i was looking for, il;'sjust a gradual degradation or gradual change in the color."
okay; i'm around.
"okay. we're thinking you might have, on the way to the geology stops, driven between a couple of the trident craters then."
"that's correct. 05 06 '3241 cc all right, jack. 'i_enext is at ei minus 4 plus 30. we want to ;_erify that the l_lis configured for command module rcs hotfire. 05 06 33 08 cml' okay. verify lm eonf__gure for rcs hotfire at ei minus 04:30."
roger.
"okay, ... - - 00 03 24 o1 cml° hey, when that thing's lined up, it's one bar width - the target is one bar - -"
"16, would you verify bmags in f3.te 2."
okay. that's fine. 06 21 _6 0_ l_-eva on the dac. we used up r yesterday.
okay - - 5 feet per second. that looks good.
"bob, there's just a couple little bows around the transmitter, is that -"
"we're pointed right at you, ken."
"and the command module just did their plane change burn, and it's a good burn. 07 01 06 16 l_-eva good. i!"
(sigh)

that's affirmative. and you want a lm/cm delta-v? it's 1.1.
"oh, no."
"well, don't get too far inside."
(laughter)
"tico, this is photo. all main chutes are deployed. there is no sway on the module. it's coming down, straight down."
i mean ...
"oh, roger. we're ready. any time you want to go to transmit, let us know."
okay.
there's our loveletts again. little lovelett. that's oriented like that. ()kay.... that is chaplygin ....

"here, my friend, is a lunar rock."
get what you want?
"if it's quite close, but if it's not, don't bother, i think we can probably try this by hand."

"okay, dave. stand by. i'll check -"
"you got the other light thing set for go, huh?"
"... in, but that doesn't ..."
"you know, it wouldn't hurt us to get that waste water dump started."
yes.
"okay, houston, we have the - we have the bit 3 set in the 21 46."
roger. we're just noting your hot mike.

"that's affirmative, ken. that's still the plan."
what's happening down on earth?

okay. cabin repress closed. (tm q) 04 12 53 33 _ okay. (tranq)

...
okay. recorder - is off.
"okay. we've got a real long procedure here. i don't think you need to copy it all down. let me just read it through to you once, and kind of let me discuss it as we go. what we want to do is kind of get a look at the thing tomorrow and see what the condition of it is. after you disconnect the lm umbilical, we want - would like for you to open the orange lm umbilical connector cover and inspect the roller pawl. the roller pawl, we hope, is engaged in the detent, but we would like to find out if it's in the detent, or is it free, or sticking up, and you can do that by looking in the side of the latch after you remove that umbilical connector cover. is there any question on that?"
"things normal, except a part of my nose itches i can't get to."
there it is.
system - s-band aux tv to sci?
bal_ce couple is on.
"the hatch is open, houston."
"okay, pete and al, before you leave there, also, would you get some of those geosamples which we've discussed, as well as some of the loose soil from that area?"
"okay, charlie. can you hold up here a second? i lost you."
"houston, 15."
would you confirm that the delta-v thrust a switch is up and the light went out. is that correct?
"okay. right now, houston, the voltage is - is looking good. and we had a pretty large bang associated with the caution and warning there. and as i recall, main b was the one that had had au amp spike on it once before."
real fine. how about you?
i don't know where it went.
roger. we copy.
roger. now stand by 1.
"you know, after we pitched over, i was just looking for a place to land. i'm not sure. i just didn't want to hit one of those boulders out there which would have been as easy - and look at that. look at right in front of us. i didn't want to land there either."
"wait a minute before you do. you got a second? just come over here by the left front wheel. i know you got a second. just a little bit closer to the left front wheel, towards me. oh, that's good, anywhere in there. wait a minute."
()kay. that's - that sounds reasonable. let me ask you one question about this antenna. i've got a - a little discrepancy between the - the set knobs that i have and the feedback read-outs that i get off the instrument panel. this is on the high gain settings.
"because i'm late sampling, that's why. but i'll do it, anyway."
"america, houston. i have a couple updates to go in the flight plan."
thirty seconds. (columbia )
roger. i understand.
ail right.
negative. i don't think so.
"we can get into the descent water for _inking, huh?"
"okay. in your flight plan, at 199:20, you can strike pcm cable, unless your relativistic speed has mauaged to lengthen that cable, i guess. at 199:25, you can strike the three lines, ""cmc mode, verb 22, and cmc mode."" and, then i have a pad for you at 200 plus 20, when you're ready."
"jack, next time the surgeon would like a mark on each individual aspirin."
first time anybody ever laid it on the line for a microbe.
"that's acceptable, fred, and meanwhile, when you guys are ready to copy, we've got an mcc-2 pad for you."
"go in bag 405. that's a big round - round rock that's dust covered. i see white streaks through it, and i can't tell from the clasts showing through that i can see whether it - it seems - no, i don't know whether i can see any glass on it or not. but it's a friable white rock, and it's rounded."
"well, for work purposes, ken is putting up the optics now."
"right. i - the only two i see possible here are bessel e and sulpic - sulpicius gallus, and i guess they might not go that deep even so."
"let me get out - while he's - i'll get out check- list here, while you're - - onfid ayl"
"okay, jack. copy."
the arm light is out; the sps delta-v thrust a is coming on -
"and we're gonna change our shifts around too, so i'll be on again in the morning, and then stu'll get it in the afternoon."
"okay, can you give me a bearing and range at victory?"
are you saying you think this whole bit - you think this whole big blue-gray thing is an inclusion?
okay. ail right.
roger.
"okay. go ahead, 16; we're - -"
08_:_4:53.
"and, joe, looks like a lot of - a lot of debris is just hanging out the side near the s-band antenna."
that's right.
stand by 1.
okay.
camera power - 07 i3 43 17 cmp off.
i'm surprised you didn't high center with that one.
"we don't need dust from the top. if this is a better fillet than the other, you might take a soil sample there, and then a reference soil away, and then a chip off the rock, and we'll have a good fillet sample."
"man, that's hard on the old fingers. like, it's still running, too."
"endeavour, we'd like to have high gain antenna, auto."
we're going right down u.s. 1. (eagle)
"okay. i'm right directly over littrow at the present time. and, i can see all the way around - to the apennine front - encompassing all of serenitatis between here and there - except to the north over by posidonius. so, i got a very good view of sulpicius gallus - and that sort of extends off my l0 - ll, to 12 o'clock position. and the observation i wanted to make, in particular, was - the - the distinct way that the - that the rilles do follow the - the old mare basin. and, the fact that the second color band that we dis- cussed in littrow - seems to be continuous right on across the - the basin into tranquillitatis and on around - _lm_st a shelf - a continental shelf - appearance - on into the sulpicius gallus. and, that seems to be that second color band that we noticed in littrow. there is a darker color - coloring - in the uplands in littrow and closer to the - to the front or closer to the basin of - of scarp. but the second band seems to go all the way around sulpicius gallus. and, then - as you follow 8ulpicius gallus on around a little bit more to the west, that color banding is still there. i can see a distinct boundary between it and the - and the serenitatis basin itself - inner basin - but it turned into little more brownish color from the gray color that we saw before."
"i guess, maybe we could say, perhaps, color is in the eye of the beholder."
okay. i'm going to tidy up the rover.
"hey, joe. do you want to dump waste water down to 25 percent. is that right?"
okay.
okay ....
that's so charlie.
"okay, the throttledown was on time, essentially. and we're on descent fuel 2."
that's enough. you got a piece of the - -
okay.
b is closed.
- - starts at 2 hours 37 minutes and 43 seconds.
"okay, ken, before los here, after you exit that 52, we'd like to check your boom talkbacks. 07 00 12 50 cml° okay. stand by, and i'll be with you. okay. i'ye got - -"
"okay; the temperature - the shorting plug is pulled and the temperature reading is reading about like - golly, i can't believe it. it's reading (laughter) - it's reading about like three-quarter scale."
- - 15 - for dave and jim. how many times did each of you fall down on the lunar surface? did any of these falls hurt you or give you any problems?
don't lose that picture. that's going to be one that's going to hang around for years. i don't give a shit if it's - streaked.
"okay, i guess you've answered most of our questions on the mass spec, and you've approached one that we might get a little more out of, and that is those guide rails sticking through the guides. there is a tapered portion, and when it's com- pletely seated, you actl,ally see the - the - the cylindrical portion beyond the tapered portion. did you actually see the cylindrical portion, or was it all tapered area that you looked at on the guide rail? 10 05 49 32 cml° okay, that's good scoop. all i saw was the tapered area."
okay.
"roger. you're going to let me land closer to hawaii, too, aren't you?"
"negative, jack, because the switch - 0mni bravo, please, 17."
remember how it was up at - at that crater - at schooner?
okay.
got that.
"okay, there's those four circuit breakers over there, ken. when you said panel 8, that's what i thought you were talking about. i don't think the circuit breakers are out right now, t but why dou'f,w_ ,ira;i[,,ut.- verify the circuit br*,,ak_,r'::u;ulput t,h<_[:wjl,rh_..tqo matn a/main i_.

"yes. that's what we're thinking about, too. you want me to do a quick p527 it kind of looks like - we've been talking it over, and it kind of looks like we'd probably aline our plats - lm platform with our platform and then power down the cm, and keep the lm powered up doing a dps - whatever dps burns you give us?"
lmp frame for that sample - looks like about 60.
"say again? 00 o0 25 o0 i24p the manifold pressure on d is a little low, about 2."
beautiful.
"okay. understand. and just subjectively, could you compare - now that you've been up fairly close to smoky and on stone - could you compare the two - two structures ?"
... meal last night?
"okay, that bag's empty."
"let's try it like that for a while. i'll get a couple of panoramas with it, here. 04 13 59 [3 cc roger. you look okay as far as distance goes, nell. and we'll line you up again wnen you finish the panorama. now you're going too fas' on the panorama sweep. you're going to have to stop, or-"
okay. let's get rid of these tool harnesses. we don't need those anymore.
"that's okay, we can burn anyway. who want - who wanted you to do that? are you doing this for jerry thomas?"
sure do.
"roger. 04 06 39 06 i24p-lm jim, entered the p52. we've got you on the aft omni now."
okay. i've got them here.
say again.
yes.
don't i wish it - -
what happened?
"and if you believe that, you're really a ... 02 09 52 20 _p okay, houston; 17. i don't know if you're ready for this or not, but we have a few reports for you."
*** your mike.
"ail right, babe, you're all right on your time."
"and, with your kind of luck, it probably lowered the angle s_ne more."
"we copy, 15."
instant sunrise_
"no, we did get it last time. o0 12 10 33 cml° pete, on the last sequence, we did go free."
before we get any dirt on it.
and that's all the ch_nges on that page. ready for the next page?
you going to have to start charging bat b.
"how abou% a boot in the ass, huh? 01 06 37 57 i_p that was pretty nice."
"the film jammed in the mag, and - it stripped the threads, in the film. whew! mag charlie; you got a nothing on charlie. let's go! move! charlie's in the etb."
baby ray.
yup.
"columbia, houston. we'll have los at 101 28. a0s for you 102 15. over."
go ahead. over.
_laughter)
"okay, so you're going to pro at 211:26 then, right."
easy does it.
that may be a good idea.
"okay. okay. lcg is cold, yes. that's for sure. okay. cb(16) ecs: lcg p_ip, open."
roger. go ahead. i'll be doing a p52. _onft___ _ 6
roger. at 272:10 - 09 19 53 27 cml° okay.
okay. it's att hold verb 76 for the guy on watch. and the dap load we got right now is okay.
"roger. and at 163:40, we can add, ""mapping camera, image motion, increase/on."" and also, ""gamma ray, gainstep, shield, off."""
"okay, go ahead. any other words."
okay.
970.... the line-of-sight rate.
i'll have to ask dave.
yaw 1.
stand by.
"the only thing we haven't done is rendezvous radar checkout and we'll get to that soon as ken gets through with his burn. 04 01 0h 48 cc roger; we're recommending that rendezvous radar checkout on the back side, mid landing radar checkout is the one we want to go through now. 04 o1 04 56 lmp-p4 ail right, fine."
"roger, ron."
right on. why don't we just ...?
"okay. i - i - i know where we are. an emu check, mine reads about 55 percent 02, houston."
and we're coming up now on old kastner.
"yes, i'm watching them. okay. you have the etb stowed, right? ( nfide."
stand by on that.
"ll, this is houston - -"
there it is.
"yes. 05 22 01 15 i_p-lm okay. you have to push it some. 05 22 01 23 cdr-l_ oh, you did it. 05 22 01 25 lmp-i_ that was easy. 05 22 o1 26 cdr-_ yes. 05 22 01 27 l_p-i_ get the back flap first? the levas."
"oh, oh, oh, oh -"
i can see some lineaments on the surface which appear to be from the descent engine. they radiate away from our position here. we'll take a closer look at those later.
yes.
did. okay.
"okays cmc activity light out, key verb - key verb 66 enter, stu."
"15, houston."
let me get a - get a -
there you go.
"negative, bruce. just give me the latitude and :' (columbia) longitude over 2, altitude, and the grid squares never mind the other. you're broken up."
mark; standby.
... still too ...
probably that - 04 17 48 19 lm_ it's the door handle. i got it loose now.
okay.
"ron, we'd like the h2 tanks and b fans to on, please."
okay. cabin gas return to egress.
okay. now you're starting to build a rate to the north.
ail right.
that's all correct.
"okay, could you - that's good; that's a good position. okay, tony. the rear steering is not working."
"did you take a picture, jack?"
"yes, wait until next week, and we'll take a vacation."
okay. we're at 12 clicks and we're full bore.
okay. csm is 34727 and the lm is 5103. over.
"okay. i guess we're ready to strap this thing on, huh? no, i've got to have that first."
"and as near as i can figure, tony, what we've got to do now is load up the plsss and go get them. want me to reset the fa_ uv again, or you just want to be happy with this? we - all we got to do now is a piss loadup."
"doesn't make any difference, it's there - comes out or not. okay. sculptured - -"
"america, houston."
"question 13: from an astronaut's point of view, would you discuss the possible operation - oper- ational difficulties, besides language, to be overcome in the proposed joint u.s./u.s.s.r. manned space flight? and would you have any suggestions to m_ke?"
"look at that baby; that rock looks a little dif- ferent. 05 12 40 19 _ okay. i don't think - don't think it's going to fit. let's put it in one of these bags. it'll fit in there, pete."
"go ahead, ttouston; aquarius here."
"- - ... bat charge ... (laughter) ... he's going to be going ah, ah, ah, ah .... power on the buses and - (laughter) 07 04 16 22 _ ... like the dt squirms (laughter)."
"dave, it probably came for - from the uncoupled - thrusting we were doing yesterday. other than that, i'm not really sure. it's - it's by no means certain. anyway we're just i guess - we'll be watch- ing it today and get back with you, with the final bit of information on it."
... more?
mm-hmm.
oh -
read you the same.
roger.
okay. egress ?
the old man wrinkled face on the - -
want to set ali zeros in there? okay.
yeah.
"look at this thing. it hasn't fired a thruster in 3 minutes, charlie."
"okay, ron, this next one - actually we're calling it 212:20, but the simulator came out at 212:18:40, just for information. and it's the following: stop scan at roll 039."
we're all watching. we just hope we see it before you go los. c_v[p (laughter)
"that's affirmative. i'm about to drop the hatch. 05 23 52 18 lm3 okay. overhead dump valve, auto, al."
"okay. 07 2i 36 07 cmp well, if you br - if that's a good one; you just need one."
yes. it is fun. onfidential
"three and a half feet a second, and you're at 6300 feet."
that's affirmative.
"okay, bob; 082, 5.0, and 4.3."
okay. we're looking for no_ 63; go ahead.
rcger.
"it looks like it has a little color change down there, too. 06 04 l0 14 lmp-_-_fa yea, maybe a - a slight. seems to get a little darker, a lighter and a little darker."
"feel yourself around, and it's nice and easy to get around. just don't let your body start moving too fast down there. okay. side hatch is coming open slowly."
"no, there's samples in 6."
"see you gordy, and thanks for keeping an eye on us."
"oh, we'll rmnke - make a grab sample here, as well as doc_menting. get one that'll ..."
"the rake is on the rover. the scoop's on the rover. we got the - you put the core under your pan, right?"
okay.
well that device may look something like your little boy.
"bob, we cannot get an sesc in 4 minutes - -"
"verify gpi returns to zero, zero."
okay; thank you.
"america, houston. if you're all on the headset, if you'd like, we've got the news for the morning."
"okay. we want an option 1 and you've got some ball angles for sun and moon. and right now, jim has the sun pretty well squared away right in the middle of aot."
"okay, ags says it's 9.1."
"16, houston."
okay.
"15, this is houston, broadcasting in the blind, with a request that, if possible, we bring back dave's lcg. if it's already stowed in too inaccessible a place in the - in the jettison bag, don't bother. but if you can possibly save it, please bring it back."
roger. thank you. apollo 16 air-t0-ground voice transcri_ion
"endeavour, this is houston. thirty seconds to t- stop on the mapping camera. over."
"oh, okay. i went to off there for a second, and i'll go to retract now, and then to extend."
yes.
fly that thing in there.
"oh, man. you're going to have to - your legs are really filthy. not much i can do about it. 06 2b 5b 58 cdr-evb okay, i'll get them off. why don't you start back - - i2_p-eva just kick them against each other ... - -"
"okay, everybody's happy."
okay; sure will.
"okay, jim. thank you. we will ask you to - to move that one down before you climb on."
we copy.
it's the old boulder-rolling trick.
"never did, huh?"
"i'm sorry, babe (laughter)."
"gordy, we never saw it coming in a couple years ago. we saw it, as i recall, a day out, and we saw just a - a shadow of the limb. but we - to my best re - recollection, we never saw it this close. as a matter of fact, we went into darkness prior to going into loi, and this time, much to my amazement, we don't. but i see now that we won't, and i see why. i'll tell you, everyone who's seen that view leaving knows how fast you climb out. and by golly, the closer we get to it, the faster we're coming in."
"okay, dave; copied that. sounds great."
"no! n-o, no."
"oh, maybe that's still - i'd swear the general impression i have of this back side is that it has a much harder surface on it. and i don't really know why. i'm looking now at - i think i'm looking at green. and on the northern end of it - north - again we see a lot of material that seems to be striations and streaks that go down over the sides. there's slightly different albedos. almost everything up here is just a subtle tone of albedo change. but everywhere you see an albedo change, there is, in fact, a nice demarcation that goes with it. and i'm going to get one here that's on the crater rim."
vent ...
"okay. and the other thing, thav out of curiosity - if the guys in the back room, after they get throu_h getting all the important things squared away, tha_ they could kind of think some more about their list of things that causes this enable relay to change state. i'll compile a list of vhose things in case we come across something later on that we hadn't thought about."
"orion, this is houston. is the csm above you or below you? we hope he's directly ahead."
okeydoke.
"okay, we don't need an answer now. karl's got some things on - on that. we can use this as a discussion period, i guess."
or at least i've configured for it. i'm not sure eagle sent it or not.
will do.
and switch 1 is going clockwi - switch 1 is going clockwise. switch 5 is going counterclockwise.
i hope not.
"roger, gene."
i don't worry about any jet. let's worry about a little coremhere ....
i have a p in the vent window.
okay.
right.
"hey, jim, is the waste water stopped?"
"self test to heaters. excuse me, charlie."
that's affirm. that's the only thing i have.
"okay, and i guess it's to tell us what the re- siduals are doing more than anything else and we'd like to know that."
"okay, sir. i've got your p24 pad."
sorry.
roger. you're still counting on a quick trip out to the alsep antenna?
"no, i didn't see staging. it was too hazy for that, but we could see it for a few miles anyway."
"and, jim, we have a lengthy procedure here for powering up the csm and turning on instrumentation so we can check the tm, and this will take a large piece of scratch paper whenever you're ready to copy."
"well, i can't see. your left hand's in the way now. away from you. twist it away from you 180 degrees."
... get it out of mine ...
"okay, jack, you clean up the dsky and eventually get the po0."
"well, we're going in about the right direction."
okay. it's been done - -
roger; copy.
scs.
right?
i think i'm out of film.
no.
"i never thought about the tv pass, though, to tell you the truth."
"okay. i'm sorry, but the evil winds are blowing again, you guys. (laughter)"
"neil and buzz, this is houston. to clarify my last, your consumables are in good shaoe at this time. the 30-minute reference was with respect to the nominal timeline. over."
really?
"apollo 13, houston."
"sequence camera. okay, suit gas diverter. okay, let's get helmets and gloves off."
"man, there's the lunar surface."
(music) trying to get some more of this good food down.
roger.
not yet. i need you ... back of the window for c nfidentiaiiml
"houston, apollo 15."
which way should it come out of?
"your volunteer's checking in here, joe."
"dave and jim, we're scratching our heads on that down here; and, as you know, all we need really is a - is a small metal-to-metal connection be- tween the broken piece and the root of the antenna coming out. dave, you may want to tape the _ntenna over across the top of the plss if you think that'll be mechanically more secure than taping it straight up. we'll rely on you to de- cide on that one."
"apollo 11, houston. we got the load in. the computer's yours. over."
"joe, do you want to reset on the nav system? or do you want to go ahead and pull a circuit breaker on that?"
just wait umtil you get tc j-j.
"11, houston. we'd like to try operation with the high-gain array here. if you would select reacquire and your s-band antenna to high gain, your positions are pitch plus 40 and yaw 270, and then monitor for acquisition. over."
okay.
oh - beautiful. fine.
that's correct.
okay; give me the brush. try and get as much as we can.
"say, did you see those two craters we just flew over, dick? 04 09 36 34 cml° negative."
i'm reading you 5 by.
change out the switch.
"okay, it's a rain, and i'm reading 3.7. okay; plss 02, on."
...
okay; 7 degrees south and 8 degrees west.
... what that was?
"copy; 43 yankee. and how about a frame count after - right now, gene - jack."
okay.
"okay. and we have two general notes. one refers to sim door jett, and it's a reminder that we verify that the lexan shield is mounted in - window 5, with the cardboard shade off, for a photograph of the sim door jett. at - this is about 74 hours. 02 22 38 10 _ okay. i understand."
"okay. 03 23 35 33 i_mp okay, go to auto track."
"hand me the tool, would you, dick?"
"it's on the met, bruce. it never made it en the celrffer a. 0k 21 58 59 cz i thir_ ed put it on. 04 21 59 02 i2,ff negative."
"okay. i guess we're not able to see it until the lm electrical power runs out. 08 07 22 26 cr_p yes, sir. it went on time. of _ourse, it was in the dark and we couldn't see it vo verify it visual- ly, but - all indications were that everything was a normal deployment."
"oh, we're going to have a lot of bags under my seat, joe. f-_ 05 22 51 l0 cc okay, jimmy. i hope we can fill some of them."
i got it; i got it.
"okay. how about when you went around on the other side? did they poke out at you there, or were the - what i'm trying to get a feeling is - did it indicate a top and bottom in the rock, or did it just poke out all over the rock?"
okay. now - - 05 !2 02 35 cc we copy that you've stopped on the seismic.
"okay, jim. our torquing angles - we didn't copy, but they were less than a half a degree. and our noun 06 is at 95:23 and 24. for commsnd module, plus 268, plus 10919; plus 005, 00503. lm, 29338. and then my - ... gimbal, 28925, 35491. and the torque was about a minute before that on the - on the p52."
"yes, charlie."
look right here. look right through the hatch. 00 00 51 h7 cmp i can't get the - ail i san see is darkness.
"boy, i tell you, if i hand on to this camera until you stop and can tighten it up, it'll be a miracle."
what do you see out your upper window?
right. that's right. so it worked out okay.
"you're in normal. 03 09 58 42 i_m_ yes. 03 09 58 43 c_l_ okay. 03 09 58 46 l_ okay, i'm coming up on 4 minutes to go. 03 09 58 48 c_ okay. 03 09 58 54 i2_p mark; 4 minutes."
okay.
"roger. understand, and we can see somebody's foot, as well."
roger. sounds good.
- - get those yet.
roger.
"slew. 03 23 41 03 i_mp okay, ken. you can turn on b3 and the transponder, as you wish."
"and if you don't hear from us - if you don't hear from usg off and on; well, that's because we're not talking to you."
*** any more?
"want me to help you? wait a minute, see ... - -"
everything else is ready. the - -
that's affirmative.
"logic power a, open."
"i guess we leave it there, don't we - - 06 05 03 51 imp-eva yes. _ 06 05 03 52 cdr-eva - - houston?"
"charlie, you hit my arm."
i concur. i concur.
"okay. what's going to happen is: when we do get in attitude, we can bring it back to auto and get it locked up; but we will need the narrow beam."
right.
jack - -
"matter of fact, we ought to just about have aos. and i'm - forward."
"yes, you're right, boy, you're right .... - - 03 lq 46 24 sc (yawn)"
"okay, sounds good. with you in a minute, we're just cranking up high gain now."
"cl_allenger, _%merica. yollwant to trpjv_d2__!'igin_ - ranging and re_td_:zvousf_daw compare?"
we'll be an hour down by the time we get to the top of that thing. you got six samples.
"intrepid, houston. go po0 and data. we're ready to go."
"tranquility base, houston. on my mark, 25 min- utes till t3. stand by. 04 08 lh 46 cc mark."
mark.
"oh, okay."
it is 4.1.
"okay, bobby. thank you."
"jim, i don't see ..."
f/87 i'll try one at f/8.
"yes, is it there?"
okay. i got that one.
... is egress. i2_p-lm that's verified.
"okay, al. mostly questions here about the con- tamination status and things in the sim bay. first of all, how about the - the - the door eder - the door edges? did they blow off smoothly and cleanly?"
get some?
"okay, tony, it's a white matrix; it's a breccia, looks like, white clast with some greenish-looking, very small millimeter-sized phenocryst in a black matrix."
"take pictures of it. *** got to take 5 more minutes. we'll be right with you. what jack's done is he dug a- a trench in a - the southwest- northeast direction, and he discovered about 5-1 8 l 3 inches below - 4 inches below the surface - a very light-gray material."
guess what.
okay. carnarvon at 52. carnarvon (rev 1)
"roger. on that 20 flc'wtransducer town here on telemetry, our values are agreeing pi_et_y well with what you read out onboard, and the eecomm's have been noticing this cycle, but it still looks like the indicated rate is lower than waat we would expect. we're still working on the prcolem, and we'll let you have a fore complete diagnosis on it in a little while."
what do you show for your - perilune?
we sure are. we're all ears. sure wish we had the tv.
"apollo 15, houston. over."
okay. i'm just finishing up my fruit cocktail.
take the whole thing.
...
how did you cycle the film?
"and we had plus 0.3 to go; so that means - - 03 10 07 12 c_ i saw it slip once, so it's probably 7.2 - -"
these are a couple of good ones.
roger.
what do you need?
"okay. how do you read now, joe? i'm going from omni c to d now. }'age 156"
- - up there is the same.
okay; enter.
"man, there's some boulder rolling rocks here, jack."
"fact is, we're recommending a design change, joe."
"no, no sweat i've got that. we'll have to get the plss 02 off. i'll get mine; i can reach yours real easy. i can get it in a minute. as soon as we get up i'll get it. yes, i can reach it, i think, now. and we're going up to high pressure here when we start dumping the cabin."
roger.
"very presumptuous. okay, bruce, i'm coming around one more sector. and you should be able to - i'm going to move it just a little bit more - you should be able to see the large rock, the four or fiw_ rocks i was talking about in my discussion before we got out of the lm. now i'll zoom in on those, if i may. oh 18 54 13 lmp here we come."
"yes; just a second, ed."
say again?
"okay. hello, houston. do you read challenger? hello, houston. do you read challenger?"
"there we go. okay. there, we're going up in the tunnel."
good. 05 22 17 1t cdr yes_ it was worth the effort then.
"okay, tony. we're down to 1585 on the ..."
"okay, the lsm is on the surface. i'm going to deploy the central station."
"i'm getting to like driving this machine. okay, pull pin 2. pin 2 always comes after - goes before pin 1."
"loud and clear, jack."
"here you go, pete."
logic's off.
"houston, aquarius."
"okay, hopefully, that's most of it."
stand by.
"hey, jack. houston."
okay; you'll have to hand stuff to me then.

"hello, houston; endeavour. loud and clear."
"and, houston; falcon. ! have a visual on the endeavour now. the coas is exactly boresighted, the radar needles are boresighted, and the pgns needles are boresighted, and the ags needles are boresighted, so we're looking pretty good."
did you sleep pretty well that way?
"america, houston."
okay.
roger. understand.
the piece of tape is so dusty - it may not work.
"oh, yes, yes, yes, yes."

"and, houston, what's the temperature limit on the dsea?"
"okay. and, jack, and if you'll listen for a minute, i'll tell you some possible 50g-millimeter targets the people have in mind. one, the lm, if you carl see it from there. tv'o,nansen, if you can see it from there. three, lara; and four, shorty. in other words, i guess they're talking about looking along your traverse from yesterday. it would be mostly the back shots, apparently. and then, a]so, the south massif, and i don't know what you can get of boulder tracks leading up the north massif. and most of those will be looking downhill towards the lm, stations 2, 3, and 4. over. nansen, lara, and shorty."
what did you do with the scissors?
"the moon is aw_i bright. i sure don't. ail i see is a- 08 23 38 0_ lm2_ in other words, it must be shifting. let's see, we've get - on the tape recorder - we have 30 min- utes of high-bit-rate recording, don't we?"
"oh, you have 56 pounds you called back, including the weight of the src, which is about 12 pounds. so that would make it about 44 pounds."
"*** 45 yankee near the sep. that's all we have. if you give us a frame count when you get done, and give us an approximate location for the rover, at least crosswise from the y, we'd appreciate it. and we also need sep receiver power and dsea both ; on. and we'd like the cover taped back - taped down when you get done, jack."
"oh. wait a minute, pete. i'm sorry. god durn. we've got a maneuver now."
"*** the other hook that came - turn a little more left. no, it didn't - it didn't come off, i don't think - unless it - the bottom's off, but the bottom is not going to stay up. and it's not - you're not going to lose it. the tops are so tight you'll - your bottom's loose, but that - that's because your harness shrunk a little bit. i_p-eva okay. how's my lens?"

"okay, crew. about the only other thing i've got for you right now is an update to your p37 pad for lift-off plus 35. this is a change to the pad we gave you yesterday. the reason for the update is for weather avoidance in the mid-pacific landing area at 70 hours, which is the return time for this pad, and in case the question arises in your mind, we don't expect any problem there for she end of the mission. the weather area is 20 degrees south of your end-of-mission landing point, and it appears to be moving to the south."
"okay, houston. we're going to :lover the teievison camera, load it back to its original location."
if i cea find it. there it is. if you'll hang on to it here for a second.
i don't think it'll be big enough for the ears.
"roger, al. verify that on your last p52 you used option 1."

"okay, jack, i'm going to go through these steps and take my helmet and gloves off."
"and one other point now i'd like to clarify, ken, is that for your tracking - see after you go to your track attitude, cmc will start you off on a rate drive, and then go to scs control and go to minimum impulse and pitch, and just every now and then, you might have to flip it - like between ppi [?] and midcourse l, it just took one minimum impulse time and kept me right up around the 22 degrees trunnion."
"you didn't get a picture to the lm then, did you?"
"okay. that crack on the end there, we'd just like you to trim that back. and, examine the thing down where it goes into the - that connector there and make sure it isn't cracked down there."

"hit it harder, please."
"okay; verb 49 maneuver to x-ray attitude will be 174, 133, 032. and the high gain angles are pitch, minus 14; yaw, 105; they want to go reacq and wide on the high gain, and then step to narrow in the normal way. and if you lose corem,go to omni delta."
"yes, neil's standing on his head again. he's trying to make me nervous. _:"
"okay, and- - 06 23 53 54 ij4p-eva - - and the core stem up there on the porch. - -"
evaporators on.
i copy ths.t_ jack - -
"jack found it. he uncovered it as he was walking on the rim, and we worked with that, and then, as i went around the crater to take the stereo base pan from within the crater, i could see alterations radially down from the rim farther beyond where we were working down to the center."
"no, i'm done, jack."
okay_ eon. ft looks intact here. there's one coyer - -
"next row down, the fourth row, ""suit fan 1, open, updata link, close."""
"not long enough, yet."
"okay, okay; you got it right now on the ""now."" okay; say that again, ken."
(chuckle) it's a great massage.
take it apart with -
"okay, that's correct. now at - that same page - 158:13, after ""pan camera - on,"" add a line that says, ""v/h override - high altitude."""
roger.
okay. 04 l0 40 bb lmp-lm okay. i'm reading b.4. that's 2/10ths in a minute.
that a boy. 05 14 05 16 imp how's that? 36o 'con ftd: -'t l 6
you have to think that - you're not going to do ...
roger. thank you.
"no, that was just a geophone _ problem. the geophones are in the right directions."
"eagle, houston. when you are ready to copy, i have a lunar surface data pad for you. over. 04 04 51 08 _ roger. stand by. (eagle) 04 oh 51 10 cc we've got the load in, eagle. you can go back updata link off. over. 04 04 51 21 hmp roger. (eagle)"
go ahead. lm_ has mark come u_ with a preliminary heat flow n_m- ber yet or is he still equilibrating?
"okay. that's ep-2, jack."
"no, i didn't eat that last night. never gov around vo it. why don't you just leave it there? maybe i'll eat it."
"go ahead, 15."
my torso tiedown is okay. three 02 connectors? nfide ii
roger.
stand by.
"purge valves on and locked. 04 23 28 32 i_p-i_ okay; water connectors, one, locked. 04 23 28 34 cdr-i_ locked."
"yes, i guess i ought to put it to use when i start cycling on the cryo fans here shortly. you know, we - actually, we have plenty of time. i could put that 105 lens on again and take a colored picture. 00 01 54 33 cml° yes."
roger.
"okay, }fen,the a - out your - your window, off behind you on the high gain side, it's real nice and clean; on the other side of the spacecraft, the - the 180 opposite that, starting at about the middle of the hatch around, is pretty badly blistered and peeled. not peeled, but blistered; around about the umbilicals."
"i just want to tell them i turned off the rear steering to see how she works with the front and it's really a lot better. the double ackerman's a little too responsive when you have the lack of traction, especially on the slopes."
and there's one whole side of that spacecraft missing. 05 18 0_ 50 cc is that right?
...
we concur.
okay. i got it. it's right here in front of me.
"isn't that sharp shadow out ti,ere the lm? see it way out there? almost under the sun. it's got to be. it's the only sharp shadow out there. right under the sun, straight down there."
okay; copy that.
"okay. thank you. we copy; 39.2 volts, and 1.6 amps."
"yeah. that's cm-sm sep, one, two, closed."
okay. boost/entry.
"okay, rover, checkpoint i is 160 at 1.9 clicks, and there's no need to stop there. we can press on towards checkpoint 2, if you're satisfied."
i don't think it took.
"tony, is - -"
- - ...
rover - -
"say again, houston."
yes - -
"well, let's not do that yet. there's a whole bunch of other things that they want you to do here first. you want to do it in order?"
"yeah, you are. keep pitching, john. pag2e day"
"well, the water problem evidenced itself before we noted any erratic motions of the pc02 gage."
"okay, you got it, babe. we'll have some mission rules for you momentarily, and the powerdown checklist and also a ptc setup. over. 03 03 23 24 i_p okay."
"quantities look good, 16."
where are you? right there?
"okay, i got it. you want the tape? the tape. gene wants the tape."
mark; 50k.
roger.
"apollo 11, houston. we'll ha_e high-g_in cover- age about 155 30. at that time, you can t_tr_ on the tv if you desire, and continue i;ol_rr_ .i- around until you get 50 degrees roll. ow_r."
"roger, 17. the gravimeter's ready and a couple of words here. one, i presume you found the scissors, right? lmp-ev_ yes, sir."
"okay. let me give you some words on the general plan here in this rev. we want to get the pads up to you, then we'll up-link, and then we wa_ntyou to do a p52 option 1. and then you'll pick up in the timeline book at circ."
"cb sps pilot valves, main b, open."
they didn't tell us that.
"look at all those good things in this mesa. things that i've seen before. didn't hardly stroke the gear at all, and it looked like we were - looks like i landed just about vertical."
thank you.
"no. it's no problem and - - 05 08 22 28 cnp no, i just - -"
"okay, jack. tell me there. we need to know when we're getting close to gimbal lock in the lm. we have no balls right now."
we'd like - we noticed the mixing valves cycling about once every 10 or 15 seconds. we'd like to give you a mark at which time we want you to put the glycol evap temp in valve in manual and try to catch the flow rate at the appropriate setting. i'll - i'll give you kind of a countdown and a mark here.
v-max.
okay.

"hey, dick, where are you going to sleep at night when you're by yourself?"
you got it.
"houston, apollo 13. \"
not as bad as ... time skip 08 03 51 15 i/4p roger.
looks good to me. f.identi
"well, i'll get it."
"from the nominal time line, you're down about 30 minutes now."
"okay - i'll be ready for them. bob, just one last thing on that line of clouds that stretches up toward hawaii. they're very - they look very thick and dense based on the structure you can see as that - as the terminator approaches them. _ey cast a pretty strong shadow to the west."
"okay, jim, are we going to press on with the first rev checklist?"
...
"okay, bob. i understand that. you know, i wonder if we ought to stop stirring the cryos the way we've been doing it."
"thank you, joe. enjoyed it."
okay.
okay.
"okay. we'll do it at 1_7minutes. yeah, i guess that's 51:18, excuse me."
a little low on my card.
okay.
"roger, dave. incredible. while you're peeking out there, do you have any further observations on the abundance, size, and distribution of the frags in the nearby field of view?"
"fred-o, we got about 2 minutes to the omni switch. you can go ahead and power the ranging down and and the down voice backup, and we'll give you a call on omni switch. over. 03 01 03 09 imp okay. 03 01 03 19 _ how do you read aquarius now on down voice backup?"
"roger' i.h:_[;. 03 23 22 514 lmf and }iow do 3ou re,ad, ,lee?"
"we'll make it up - - 00 02 21 33 ·cmp ... starting to pick up the reg now, isn't it?"
"yes, it's supposed to."
stand by.
"okay. bat 2, hi volt, off/reset, then 0n. 05 08 48 ii2 cc correct. bat 1, hi volt, on."
"well, i think it's because the particles and - some of them, you know, are bouncing off the lm and get out into the stream, which normally would have no collisions. how's that? you can say it's not very good. i don't care. 00 t8 53 20 cc got to use tact here."
"okay, houston; 15. it looks like we have a good seal. how's it look down there? (cleared throat)"
"hey, joe, these rounded fragments down here are on the order of meters in size; expose some very large - oh, 2 - 3 centimeter vesicles - rather than the finer stuff that jim saw back there before. and i believe, when i take a chip out of this, we're going to find it's the same kind of crystalline basalt. and they're all -well, they're subangular - looks like they've been weathered. fairly clean on the surface and all buried. and i can look down to the south, and it's just a whole mass of great big boulders along the terrace here. and there's another breakoff down into the - into the rille. and i'm - i guess, we're just about at the lip."
okay. we're going to transmit on the tv now.
"aca/jet. that's - no, this right here ..."
"well, it's nice to be able to see the lm."
"roger, al."
okay.
"this is al, 3.75; and i'm reading h0 - ho percent; no flags on low flow; and i feel fine."
in what?
"okay, well, we're off in roll - -"
- - minus 9.4 feet (cough).
and a1 will be starting in any moment.
roger. we got p47 coming up.
"ok_, geno. we copy that. 07 16 19 26 cdr-_ 0k_f, gordy. on the radar test, everyshing is go. everything is within limits. the only anoiaaly is the one i just reported."
"i'll tell you - you can - you caa use reel 2. about the only thing i can think of, jack, would be reel 2."
"okay. timeline book changes - start on page 13 and change 173:55 to 177:54. and under ""configure s-band,"" item 1, change cs - csm maneuver to jetti- son _itti_lme to ""csm maneuver to sim bay minus-x folv_ard attitude"" and delete ""proceed with prep"" et cetera. over."
man!
"if ron would just stop his maneuvers i'd tell you some more, but the earth just set behind the lm."
okay; let me try and get up there. *** we must be high enough to see something. i haven't even looked back.
ail right. now do it.
"boy, you talk about night flying, this is the kind of night flying you want to do, by the full earth."
roger.
outboards{
"okay. you do have to be rather careful to keep track of where your center of mass is. some- times, it takes about two or three paces to make sure you've got your feet _nderneath you. 02 14 14 05 lmt_ about two to throe or maybe four easy b_e.cescan bring you to a nearly smooth stop. *** change directions, like a football player, yoc just have to to *** foot out to the side and cut a little bit. 04 14 14 38 lmi_ so-called ks_geroo hop does work, but it seems that your forward mobility is not quite as good as - it is in the conventional - more eonven- tiona], one foot after another. 04 14 15 06 l_[_ it's hard saying ';_aata s_ie pace mig} _ be. i think it's the one that i'm using now - would get rather tiring after several hundred *** but this may be a function of this suit, es well as lack of gravity forces."
"oh, that's - that's nice. that's been there for a while."
i did that.
"roger, dave. and how far away do you think that might be. it sounds very exciting. 04 ll l0 15 cdr-seva joe, distances are very deceiving. i'd guess maybe 60, 70 meters. there's another somewhat deeper one just to the north of that. it - it looks to me, and jim has the same impression looking out the window, that we're much closer to pluton and - and st. george, and all that stuff_ than we expected to be."
"oh, heck. i can take the_."
"jim, i'd suggest we go down to that little bench."
"okay, go ahead."
okay.
take mine out now. wonder if i got any zaps when i was out there?
"right. on the drive enables, we'd like the left rear and the right rear to p_-2."
"okay; i'm taking it in quite slow. it's noted there are quite a few small bubbles coming out with it. so far, so good. it hasn't overflowed the - the first capillary ring. and it's taken off, and it's going by capillary action toward the bottom and toward the top."
"okay. it's moving much more rafidly than i had anticipated it would, tony. right now, the num- ber 2 sample is leading by about a nose. it's just crossed the one - two - three - four - fifth ring inscribed on that center tube. the number 3 sample has just crossed the fourth one; the num- ber 1 sample has just crossed the fifth one now; and number 2 is about halfway between five and six. number 3 sample is maintaining a very cohesive shape and looks --ike a little cylinder with a pointed nose on it, and it's maintaining its white consistency. and it's going in - i - guess that the length of the - group of particles in there that's maintain- ing a solid appearance is about the width of one of these lines. then, it tails out to a very dif- fuse gaseols - just a swirl material behind it that goes all the way back to the lexam. the faster samples are diffusing much more rapidly, and they have a little nose on them, which is very thin and leads ahead of the larger mass of material. and they form sort of a cone shape. _.d they are about two _nd a half to three ring lengths in length, and --i'm talking about the distance between - sets of rings. and they both appear to be dif- fusing about the same amount. the number 2 sample is really starting to break up now and starting to twist the - looks like it's taking on a corkscrew appearance as it approaches the yellow line. ymd it's approaching the yellow line, and now nu_ber 1 is approaching one ..._ so i'm gonna hit the re- versj_l switch."
"my gosh, we got a lot of loose stuff in scb-7."
"okay. i understand. but, we haven't seen any water around lately, but there has been quite a bit of moisture on the windows. there was when we powered up; we had to bring the heaters on for a while to get the windows cleared."
let me try.
"well, i'll tell him to try again."
"jack, you can bring up the high gain any time now."
no mtvc.
"good. good, comprehensive sample. now we need some soil. i think that's probably the best one they'll see."
five-sixths gravity that's missing.
okay. second question - -
they say it will take about 8 minutes to fill a bag.
"well, i think you ought to wait and ask them."
roger; ignition.
(laughter) how do you like it?
"okay, stand by 1, al."
"and, 15, in this damping process, we'd like to make sure that all of the jets on two adjacent quads are disabled."
roger.
okay.
that 's right.
"jim, verify power amp's primary. 06 06 34 31 i_4p-lm that's a - i'm sorry, i got the wrong one, dick."
"okay. you're pointed about 10 degrees down, out to the rover - -"
okay.
you ready?
"okay, and i'll do a better job of itemizing those switches. we were pressing pretty hard, and i'll - i'll be able to go back and get most of them, i think. and we'll keep an eye on it - on the master alarms."
"it has been variously known as that kind of a maneuver, yes."
yes....
"roger. normal rcs config, charlie; whatever that me _s."
it's gonna pull another 4g's here pretty soon.
"gene, your range is 0.1. we're going to deploy the q_,_ter-pound charge, and that'll be jack's getting off to deploy it like we talked about last night."
"anything else, before i hop in, joe?"
"yes, if it's that fragile, i'm wondering about - isn't mine. maybe you can use mine."
... houston. and the computer likes it.
outstanding.
"well, that's okay. we like a lot of friends, and i'm glad everybody enjoyed it and pass my love on - to everyone."
"no, let's do it later - because i'd have to get off and get unstrapped and everything else .... get to the seatpan."
"hey, dick, are you holding attitude? you are; aren't you?"
"15, houston. the computer's yours. and, al, before you do 50 - 52, be advised you can use the systems test meter on the back side for any of the normal lm checkout functions; on the front side, we'll watch it for you. and go ahead and leave the test meter in whatever position you' re - you're testing with. you understand? 04 01 32 12 cml° roger, ed. understand."
yeah.
"16, houston. could you give us a check on the battery compartment now?"
"eagle, this is columbia. over. (columbia)"
"in the bag. 06 02 05 05 i_mp-eva not with the soil, though, are you?"
i'm going to put that right - there.
"okay; go ahead, joe."
"the thing i don't want to do is that i don't want to be talking about what we're gonna do and - when they're saying, hurry up and get over there before you lose attitude."
seems to be ...
"roger. ail i say, this is 3 hours old so - -"
"roger. dave, during the command module pitch- around, we'd like for you to take a look at the v over h sensor in the sim bay, if you can. do you know how to spot it?"
mine is up.
"okay. did you write down your solutions, dave?"
"jack, will you go back to reacq on the high gain?"
"okay. at 3 seconds, scratch ""delta-v thrust b, a, normal,"" and insert ""cbs - cb sps pilot valve main a, closed."""
okay.
"attitude control, three of them, rot control. [0 nf.ident i/ jl oh 13 oh 53 lmp rot control. 0h 13 04 56 cdr it's going to be pgns, auto; ags, atti%tde hold."
okay.
"i guess you need them up there, too. is - is anybody sleeping in the command module right now, jim?"
"endeavour, this is houston requesting po0 and accept, and we'll give you a state vector and some drift terms."
"okay. we'd like to have them off, al."
"orion, houston."
"as i was saying - 08 04 04 22 _ ah, go to hell, mdc."
"say again, gordy."
*** altitude's good; h-dot's 4 high.
"yes, sir; certainly will."
"okay. we're going to retract the mapping camera. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1-"
"go ahead, fred."
(laughter) ... houston (laughter). you're ... - -
"drive it all the way in? 06 05 oh 41 l_-eva yeah, they don't want any more than that. 06 05 oh 42 cc okay, that looks good."
roger that.
that's better° cm2 (laughter)
"okay, stop-hour readings - is 91 and 96. battery temp is 100 - on both."
"roger,"
roger. we copy.
okay. i'll not do - i'll do the gimbal drive check with the secondary in pitch - unless - are they in the same package? it seems like they're in separate packages. the secondary in yaw is the one i'll bring on after the gimbal drive check.
"okay. maybe we ought to - next time split that in half, and put half of it on one side and half on the other or something like that."
"gordy, you want to bring us up to date briefly on how you plan on handling this time update again?"
"oh. i'll do that. hey, charlie? oh, the ir was hiding it. that's why you couldn't see it. here. 07 22 34 57 _ ... see it."
"hey, jim."
"aquarius, we need forward 0mni."
... that.
get the pictures - -
"okay. now, we did not see that until we started approaching the edge of the boulder field. the - there's no evidence of that at all that we ncticed. onfident"
"16, that was so garbled we didn't copy, so you're gon_a have to say it again."
"falcon, houston. do you have an estimate of your landing site?"
"okay. we're terminating this rendezvous radar test, ken. we're gonna go to pdi attitude."
"okay. here we go, pete. 0hh, up they go, ..., one alsep. there it is."
"okay, copy that. have you got a bias reading there, gene?"
"mark. hey, that beauty is going right in."
okay.
1000 feet. 45.
okay. our monitor showed that to be very bright.
"intrepid, that's affirmative. go ahead and button up; put the he]met and gloves on and turn on the fan and the vent flag should go out."
okay.
"okay, recorder - let's see -"
"hey, america; challenger. cdr-iim hey, ron; listen. this ridge you're coming on over - just stick your hand out the hatch and grab a rock."
"interesting, isn't it?"
okay; copy that. tape108a/26
"okay, ""1 - hcex magazine d."""
"yes, we are."
"oh, there's a rough area ahead."
"okay, all my circuit breakers and everything look good."
too bad we don't have a camera.
"say again, charlie."
okay. we're gonna range - -
i said very good. 06 00 54 57 cml° i'm hoping i can get some optics ... out for daylight.
roger. delta-delta and echo-echo.
verify ...
... affirmative.
400 at minus 14. *** p667
what's wrong with the tv? aren't you watching it?
okay. i'll try it.
"no, no, no. no."
"that's affirmative. off on i and then on 2, we'd like you to go to retract' for l0 seconds, then put her in extend, and we'll watch it."
"okay, charlie. you are in?"
"okay, ron. there are 18 spares on x-ray x-ray that you could use."
"okay, we do want to put battery a back on charge as shown in the flight plan. and, also, i have a new flyby pad. no hurry on this one, but it's a flyby pad post-mcc-2."
"that's affirm, and then you'll leave it there for about 5 minutes. we'll cue you when to extend it again."
something freaking's going on here.
"well, you end up with - you end up with four - you end up with all four pieces in a big rectangle. see what i'm - you see what i'm saying, you've got a 15-inch by 19-inch sheet of paper."
okay.
"oh, i don't know, ken. that's - that's within 18 percent."
it'll come out.
"okay, al, at 5 minutes to go, we need a - 06 20. okay?"
okay. let's turn it upside down and shake it.
"whew, it sure wasn't. up and off. 06 05 38 57 i24p-lm ... the rest of the ..."
"..., charlie, ..."
cabin repress coming open. open.
how many hours and 13 minutes did he say?
"okay, and that small chip of that is in 519. it's the same host - rock, much like the previous sample. _"
"and, charlie, your cabin ecs looked good."
how are your systems checks coming?
"no, this is a nice crystalline rock."
go ahead.
yeah.
"tranquility base, houston. we think that's okay. go ahead and reset them and press on with the hot fire. over. (goss net 1) tape 79/6"
"okay, on page 3-10, secondary p0¥_r _,_, close. and then on page 3-11 - let me know when you're there. 07 09 55 20 l[_ yea speak."
they are.
okay. and i guess we're standing by for your high gain alinement per the checklist.
oh.
roger. you can go with the h2 purge line heaters and the rest of that flight plan.
*** ed. 05 11 33 22 i2_]p - - hasselblad kilo-kilo on the met storage area.

is it usable data?
they're close.
"okay, i believe i'll just have a few pictures of you here."
we know that's a fairly good route.
"negative on the ags. however, fred, we need the atca breaker in. 02 12 46 28 imp okay. atca breakers in. yes. i guess for the backup power supply. hey, how about atca ags."
"just a minute. hey, john, i tell you what. let me get upslope."
how long you willing to wait?
ticonderoga. roger. ticonderoga did copy.
okay; very good.
- - just go a different direction.
"okay, we're starting our time."
roger. we're reading you five-by. we've got the voice good through the 85; the telemetry is in and out through the 85. stand by. we'll be back with you through the 210. over.
- - you're go at 3.
"casper, did you call?"
"i was a little slow on the ""now,"" but leave it there for now and press on with the normal procedures."
"no. as soon as the carrier dropped off, why, it drifted over into those angles anti stayed there. then when it came back up again, why, it hunted around for a while, but it didn't get any further off. gradually brought it on in to the angles where it is right now; and then the signal strength would take several jumps as evidently it goes from wide to medium to narrow. over."
"yes, i'll get it. here, let me get the tongs, and let's get those two. i was hoping i could get a larger frag here."
okay.
roger.
"good summary, gordo. we thank you, and our best wishes for the return to health of mr. truman."
yeah.
"okay. 250, 000 - well, all zeros there. amp-hours 090, 092, 80, 85; and forward motor temps are lower limit - in the rear, lower limit."
"roger. i think it came the other direction that time, didn't it?"
"roger. understand. it's got you glued to the win- dews, i guess, huh?"
"roger. sps injection valves, two, open."
"roger. go, columbia. over."
"okay, bob. we're at 230/2.2."
"17, houston. we're ready for the logic check."
now we can see you through the structure of the minus-z secondary strut.
mark.
"rate, high."
"oksy. and, john, we've had some problems here getting commands up to the bird - real-time com- mands. and we've got a command test we want to rom. and - we'll be standing by. as soon as you can get ready, let us know and we'll get into it."
"well, that's interesting, but disappointing."
got the - -
"what do you mean, ken?"
okay.
"- - 0 - 230 on the - on the forward and off scale low, and 220 on the right rear."
"okay. recommend that you put in ri the following: 03750, and that should give you exactly a rate of 0.3 degrees per second. over."
"apollo 11, this is houston. a little over 2 min- utes to los. all your systems parameters and orbit are looking good from the ground. we have aos on the other side at 78 23 31. over."
"no, it was only two to one."
okay. was that hag 350? we didn't get a number.
look at that.
sure it's green and not just white albedo again?
either way. just turn the whole tube.

"okay, it's 11:25 - - 00 o0 ll 21 imp ll:20."
go ahead.
"i mentioned there's a boulder definitely whitish in color, fred. and we'll be over vhere in a min- ute. not in our immediate vicinity. but it def- initely looks well worthwhile ssmpling."
"hold this big bag, please."
there's about 20 small rocks going into bag 343.
the lens must be like a pinhole camera.
"okay, dave."
"probably south - probably southeast. i hadn't noticed it before, but it's extremely concentrated northern hemisphere cycl - cyclone pattern. i don't know whether that's on your prog or not. that's not what's left of sally, is it?"

i'll go up on that flat area up there. 5-171
"okay. just pull it snug, charlie. 0h 23 05 32 cdr-eva how far do you want it closed about, charlie?"
roger.
get your scoop. let's get it over with.
okay.
... at least it sounds better for our purposes than the sea of crises.
"through suiting in 7 minutes! we're going to be a little behind, then."
... 50 at i0.
okay. we copy. 01 08 49 49 lm]_ looks like the southeast part of the country is all socked in.
okay_ it's in. we ought to tape that ... i'll get it. that thing came down - came off that piece of velcro *** when i get back. i_p-eva okay. ._ndlmps frame count *** is 35 ·..
okay. understand.
that's magazine aa.
"okay, about 58:45."
oh!
where are we in the checklist? let me -
four jets?
yeah; i know it. 07 07 hl 20 lmp okay.
that was 160.09.
okay. look it. let's get the cameras squared away; let's get all set to burn. we got one chance now.
here's a pair of gloves for you.
okay.
roger; copy. give me the nob_ 42 begin. over.
"ten and - yeah. uh-huh. two down, and 2 back."
"okay, we'll see what we can do. did you hear that?"
okay. i'm going up out of this crater - up on the top part of it.
"photo-1. splashdown at this time. the three i chutes are displaced. they're in the water. _ 05 22 55 12 r-1 ... recovery, i have a clock - - i end of transcription"
"are you done with our e-mod, jim?"
"16, houston. can you - can you check for us and let us know whether ken is on the biomed? is ken hooked up on the biomed? we're getting some strange readings. could be a loose sensor."
...
very good. glad to hear it.
"you remember that one, houston?"
"question 13: from an astronaut's point of view, would you discuss the possible operation - opera- tional difficulties, besides language, to be over- come in the proposed joint u.s.-u.s.s.r. mauned space flight? and would you have any suggestions to make?"

"okay. age5-6 c nfidentfj da: 6 05 23 51 08 lm2 one - we'll put them on the floor, right side forward. both of them, both of them. 05 23 51 17 _? ..."
read my frame count.
"yes, it's loose, too."
"okay. we want to change in column a, line 5 should now read 03753, and line 7 should read - -"
"roger, endeavour. we copy you. a bit noisy yet. on the second set of uv photos at t-start plus 7 minutes, a number that we have for you is 56 minutes and 49 seconds, if you haven't already computed it."
"well, now - yes, but the only ones that look fresh and not enough to penetrate are these little cnes with the glass in then."
"okay. i,etme get a go, and i think it's time for us to go ahead and put these other canisters on_ s±,and by !: 03 21 24 08 lp okay. we went to 15 on +,heprimary last night before 1 changed it and-- 03 21 21;16 cc roger th_jt, fred. we wanted to - -"

yes.
would you like us to pick another antenna?
okay. low gain - -
"okay. and i guess the lm is going to be asking you for a noun 20 pretty soon like, here."
okay.
"oh, i'm sorry. i wasn't on the loop. apparently you already briefed somebody on that."
all right. we're ready to watch.
did you see the mountains on the horizon and all that stuff?
roger. go ahead.
...
okay.
yes.
"mode control, both, att hold."
"yes, so am i."
"okay, jim. roger. we're going to do that to the maximum extent possible. and it looks reasonably feasible. to begin with in the com- mand module we're going to have to send you some separate sequences for powering it up a little bit at a time. the closer we get to entry the more we get on the checklist. by the time we're about at ei minus 45 we're on the checklist all the way."
correct.
okay. 04 13 57 i_5 lmp you're backing into the cable.
okay. will do.
"houston, 17."
houston's money?
can you see it?
"houston, apollo 11. go ahead .... (r:o_:_n;et ]) tape 61/3"
gene has pretty well chewed up the ground. i helped him. do you want me to get a little ways away from it?
"ok_t, fine. let's just leave them in the scb."
okay; ep-2.
"hello, houston; america. it looks like we're with you again."
"fire away, gordo."
...
let me know when these start going. there's the sun. give me the - give me the aot.
"well, it doesn't look real familiar, bob, as far as steno's concerned."
"other than the fact you're looking pretty woolly now, that's not bad."
"okay. that's surprising. they were kind of tight before, weren't they?"
"okay. cml° yes. wait a minute. let me get this little old box set to go here, first."
"bob, since i've got to wear the biomed anyway, i might just as well go ahead and keep it on."
roger. standing by.
"yes, i don't even see the bright spot there anymore. i know - i know where to look for it and i don't even see it."
"yeah. 100, decrease, unbalance, looking super, 40 percent. six minutes -"
okay.
- - and we want you to use rcs syst_n a.
roger. got it.
"yeah, me too."
"that does sound pretty good. as a matter of fact, i'm way overdue for a meal myself, here. i could use some of that."
okay; i understand.
"okay, bob, i've already dusted everything. and it all looks pretty good. the bay - the breakers are open; the lcru power is off ... where do you want the tv camera? do you want it tilted down and aft?"
"yes, i think so."
yes.
"17, houston. over."
yes. okay. i'll take the -
"okay. go ahead. 05 12 31_00 cc okay, jack. the time line between ei minus 02:30 and 1 hour is real crowded, so you're really going to have to hustle, and we've decided to delete the ems entry check at minus 02:30. that'll give you a little more time in there. what we've decided to do with it is wait until after ei minus 1, just before you initialize the ems. if you have time, and only if you have time, do the ems entry check. otherwise, forget it and go right on into ems initialization. you understand?"
okay.
verified.
roger.
"- - you guys to get that switch last night, and i lost my bet."
"gordy, looks like orion is - is hanging in there pretty well. she looks great."
"roger. at 95:35, we will delete ""p52 option 3,"" and that's the one we've moved up by 7 minutes."
- - and the single stem's brushed ... - -
"okay, karl. what are you receiving? are you getting any lo bit rate from the - from the lm - from the falcon?"
okay.
"okay, it4s coming down. okay. that's 4 - stand by."
thank you.
"okay, golf runs."
yeah. and then it goes away.
"okay. i just want to clarify one thing on the lm sep pad. it appears to me that in my configura- tion, i could probably use a verb 49 loading in 622, yaw, pitch, and roll, in that order; and then being able to fly out at 5018 in roll, pitch, and yaw. is that correct?"
"okay, 156. say again the data."
"beautiful. any chance of spotting rover tracks down there, do you think? f-"
"okay. after number 1, first line, cross out ""and vhf-a."" second line, cross out ""simplex operation."" third line, cross out ""prime."" that refers to prime power amp, off. that - that ""prime"" should actually be replaced by off. and that's the second prime that line. also in the third line the last word ""off"" should be crossed out and replaced by ""pcm."" fourth line is okay. fifth line, which is ""vhf voice, on, off, off,"" cross out. ""lighting, floods,"" which is the next line should be uti., but add the following, ""or overhead/forward prefer off."" okay. step 2 remains the same; no change for the moment. stand by. skip step 2. do not do it. just go on to step 3, which is ""configure circuit breakers per the chart."" that takes us to page power 6. why don't you give me a readback on what you had on power 5, fred-o."
"is that a cdu glitch there, gordy? we - huh? we sure did. hello, houston, you read america?"
what about some of these little fragments that seem to be sitting more on the surface?
"okay. oh, it still didn't work. i think maybe i've had one of those transients. 04 04 20 36 65_ for some reason, every time i pick up cmc auto, this thing - starts doing maneuvers. 04 04 20 59 imp can't believe it."
"hey, look, you don't have to."
"you get your pan, and i'll get the tg and clean up."
"just a brief report from the home fronts here. everybody's healthy, and happy, and not just a li-_tlebit proud."
i'm just going to shove it straight in; you're just not shoving it in all the way.
"and, houston, 15. we've got the rest of the pre- sleep checklist if you're ready to copy."
"all right, we're holding for 8 minutes. 03 15 27 47 l_ you guys got your things put up? ...?"

weren't we supposed to leave core tubes in there?

okay.
"dave, i guess we'll go *** verify the powerdown circuit bres_ker configuration, please."
okay.
yes.
"well, i'll be durn. the old suit gage read 4.5."
we're only 100 meters from the light mantle.
"okay, and i'm going into the landing radar check again."
"okay. and your reentry is around the dark side of the earth, and since we're coming in shallow, we're going to have to burn toward the sun to make it steeper. do you follow that?"
"just to clarify our question, al, the main ques- tion was just to confirm whether or not it did go out of your field of view. did it actually move from the full - from the full-extended position? since we saw no change in the data when we re- tracted it during the test yesterday, there is a suspicion that, even though you actuated the switch, that for some reason it didn't retract. ll 04 27 26 c_tp understand. okay. it's fully extended now, karl. but it may be too late. it may have already been out by the time we looked."
"okay, bob. that's 3 minutes. it's - delta-p change is less than 0.1."

how's the maneuver?

"15, the word here is to proceed; give your photog- raphy first priority there, and maybe we can see the - the moon out of the other window."
"all right. lrs°-eva and, houston, *** the temperature limit on the dsea?"
"stereo is stereo is stereo, i guess."
"well, they don't seem very tight, do they?"
"that's what i was trying to protect in the src yesterday. 6 19 59 59 cdr-eva here's bwp, jack. it's coming right up, and i'll go along the southern rim."
"okay; we'll talk about that. 02 08 20 55 cml° tony, i was just looking here, and if we go to the 18-millimeter lens, we can open it up to a - to a t-1. and that gets our speed up to about 1/250. it looks like a lot better way to operate."

"there you go. 08 00 ll lb cmp i need to defecate. key, i was gonna suggest, if you guys need to take one, you ought to do it before we get rid of the lm. 08 00 ll l? lmp i agree. let me get over here."
"yes, sir, both the camera and the lens, please."
yeah.
"yes. i wonder why? hey, houston."
"roger, jack."
"are you getting a rake, charlie?"
... 04 o2 21 47'_ (yelling) what?
"160 feet a second, huh?"
sounds great. sounds like a good rake sample for a change.
okay.
get my freaking ...; it's a problem to work back down there.
okay. lunar sounder operate is in standby. recorder is going on. radar is going on. recorder is gone off. off to center; not to heaters. and the mode is going to vhf.
"so are we in sunlight. 05 22 h9 41 c_p man, that ... slow. 05 22 49 4h _r (laughter) you get a little star down here?"
... circuit breakers out of there ....
"yes, it - it just looks closer, i'm sure, but we are indeed in business. and i think, once we get through here and i hop back down, why, we can talk over more of what i've been seeing up there."
112.7. ordeal operate time?
*** cover on.
we didn't sample light mantle at that last one.
the lm data card kit?
kind of hard to find.
*** let me get an after of that.
"hey, ron, just a question, here. pick up where you were briefing us there. did you go to cmc auto after the solar corona, or did you get the gimbal lock light prior to going to auto."
"yes, that at the - t-start time, yes."
"okay; i'll come back to all these things. i'm gonna eat chow. 05 2b 17 49 cmp red filter. 05 2b 22 07 cmp boy, talk about being a creature of habit. look at everything right side up. day 7 06 00 59 h8 cmp ... reason not to wear this hat ... thing. okay, i want to go magazine papa papa."

roger. understand. and we're in no hurry. i do want you to get a good night's rest though.
that's what i was afraid of. now it's back to 12.
"gordy, no. but it's conceivable i could have been keying the intercom. ! don't think so, but it's certainly conceivable. i - i checked everything else around here."
go ahead.
nine miles. 60.6 by 9. huh. 2-6 day 5
okay. copy all balls.
okay. we copy that.
"hello, houston; yankee clipper here."
"okay. understand. i think your downslope move- ment there on stone was probably - probably right. although that wouldn't explain why it was harder at 5 and 6 than at 4. well, anyway. next ques- tion here - on that half-orange-sized rock that you put on the lpm, wonder if you could estimate - estimate how common that type rock was around."
"hey, you're knocking off ... some fragments."
okay.
"... looked at that earlier and you said you couldn't do it. 06 22 35 17 _mp ... no, no ... between fra mauro and descartes."

"ail right. 05 03 52 _7 cc boy, my kids don't get as dirty as you are."
"well, i'll stand in it, and you can get at it better."
"okay. now, the next event is going to be the separation of the service module, and these are some lm steps, but so that you will know what is going on, i'll read them to you. the lm will do a lm plus-x of one-half foot per second. then you'll be hitting the cm sm sep on and up, on their command. as soon as we are free of the service module, the lm will do another _4 minus-x for 0.5 feet per second. this is called the push-pull maneuver. i think it was described this afternoon."
"apollo 1_, houston. we're go for lm jett."
"okay. on your service module rcs quad bravo package temperature, we're showing it running a little low. looks like about 20 degrees low - lower than the rest of the quads. wou2d you confirm that your rcs heater switch for quad bravo is in primary? over."
"the pan should let you measure that - well, we didn't get a pan at horatio, but we got some rover shots of it. but you may be able to come - quantify that a little bit."
roger. copy.
yeu want to give me a hack at the lm weight_ or i'll just guess a_;59¥_0 ao_ln__'.
"okay. and when you've done that, to hold the arch in place, just run a strip of tape across the side of the - that is, across the top of the arch, and anchor it down to the sticky strips along each side. u_ _o no _ ulv_ okay. i got the idea. okay. let me just repeat it here. take a cue card, form an arch over the top, bringing it under the side here. when we're through, run a piece of tape from the sides across the top of that to anchor to the other side."

i don't see canopus.

"okay. and, jack, do you - what do you see in the way of boulders coming down the base of the sculptured hills, in terms of sampling opportuni- ties of station 8 and in terms of any boulder tracks that we might - might lead down to boulders that might just possibly be accessible at sta- tion 8."
"yes, that's right (laughter)."
okay. i guess the free kills the jet monitor.

"yes, sir."
i lost you when you said try the control mode; you're a little skeptical.
okay.
just a little high. we're about a mile high. it ought - -
nice to have the quick response you guys have down there.
okay.
"yes. rp-3 is just about the limit of high sun angle that you could take to track that thing. i could track it up to tca. and then, from tca on across, you could hardly even tell there was a crater there, at all. it's just completely washed out."
get from the 1807

"16_,houston. we can go ahead and start spinning up, but first we've got to load the verb 49 with a current roll attitude and pro going to attitude and then start the spinup. and for the spinup, we'd like to use delta 2 in addition to the jets you now have configured so we can get a couple of spinups, and then turn delta 2 back off."
"houston, apollo 15."
"eagle, houston. for warm feeling, we are agreeing with your cdh. 05 06 15 15 lamp congratulations. (eagle)"
ail righty.
"roger. and at 131:39, the ""start auto pitch rate"" attitude there will be the same as the verb 49 inertial attitude updated at 131:10, which means we'll change that to - from ""171"" on the inertial to ""177."" over."
"okay, we'll just t_e you up on that, hank, and ta_e pictures of the - where's minus z? let's seo that's - that's - -"

huh?
"roger, houston. we're standing by for your cue to cycle the map and pan cameras."
"okay. i'm just a mess. course, when i do this, i get dirtier."

sure don't.
"there it goes, you guys."
that's right.
"okay. okay. first of all, general philosophy is that these rules should be similar to loi mode i abort with the tight limits. now, i'll go through them one by one for you to copy. okay. you should shut down, if any of the following happen. thrust monitor readout, 77 percent or below; dps propellant tank pressure - that's the inlet pressure - onboard readout, 160 or below; fuel to ox delta-p, greater than 25 psi - and that would have to be a ground call to you - attitude error plus or minus 10 degrees, with the exception of the start transient; attitude-rate limits, plus or minus 10 degrees a second. and you should shut down if you get any of the following a.l_: engine gimbal, iss, plus program alarm, lgc, ces dc, and if you get an inverter light after switching inverters. are you with me? 03 04 32 52 _',_ '_i:?er. tape51/7"

that's steerable.
we ought to be about through with that food locker.
"apollo 11, houston. our recommendations on the activities for the next hour or so, as far as flight plan goes_ are: continue your lm familiarization as desired until about 58 hours, then ingress to the csm, close the hatch, and establish ptc shortly thereafter. over."
was that affirmative or negative? over.
"oh, we wouldn't do that."
okay. that's - that looks like where it's probably leaking.
"okay. audio, close. okay, charlie. ready for the audio check?"
"okay, []ack. the f',,,lr{ procedut'e's okay, anco, lhen we had to fsoback to the ih and do something. and the first line is okay, cross out ""bat 5 and 6 off,"" delete that. and delete tile ne×t line also, that says ""?am_] ]] to 16 ascent eca control, open."" then we had a couple of notes which remain the same. go ahead. 04 ]4 59 20 cmp okay. i didn't get the notes, but i'll read you the steps as i haw.= them now. one step, bat 1, 2, 3, and 4 ... and at this point should have batteries 2, 2, 3, 4, and 6 on. is that affirmat 5ye? 04 14 59 -_9 cc that's affirmative. so now we have bat 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, on, and i got two notes. number 1 is: your csreuit breaker protection limits - your clrcuit breaker protection - limits the current to 15 amps. n_raber 2 note is: now the umbilical between the lm and the command module"
"okay, bat c is 37, pyro bat a is 37, pyro bat b is 37, rcs a 94 percent, b 95 percent, c 93 per- cent, d 96 percent."
i'm not sure i understood your comment there.

okay. let's do that last.
okay. this is on the side away from you as you stand facing it. right?
"and we got a good retract. okay, for the guy on the - -"
roger.
i brushed them and tapped them yesterday.
"you want me to proceed one more time on that, jack?"
"when do you want me to shut the direct 02 off, ken?"
yes. everything's look good right this minute.

take it apart with its back in the back.

"certainly doesn't look like th lna yet. cdr'eva no, it sure doesn't."
was that 50 percent?
"yes, it was."

roger. ready to copy. (tra_q)
"america, houston. did you call?"
roger. the pictures are being snapped.
"yes, we'll wrap it a little bit .... it will fit. ... fit."
ask them if they got a picture.
"okay. thanks, dave."
and we'd like you to look at the bat temperature on the uv camera.
02 flow hi. ignore it.
"we can also give you the time of day in our system of mission elapsed time. elapsed time: 34 hours 16 minutes and umpteen seconds. can you see that clearly enough, charlie?"
"okay, we're coming up on 59:40 -"

roger. stand by on that.
roger; we're hearing the same thing.
"man, this one here is tough as a -"
roger. the burn was nominal. we had - we just saw you rise.
okay.
roger.
"okay, we're just south of the rim of camelot. there is a light mantle on the other side. look at that crater. whoo!"
okay. go ahead.
but i said - you didn't hear me say it?
"verb 22, enter, 3, enter, pro. now, i want to enter and pick the first star. right?"
"gordy, you want the secondary?"
"okay, fred. we did tell you to do that awhile ago, and it doesn't matter; you're looking good."

"roger. first of all, i guess we wanted to check with you on any changes to entry stowage, and parti_ulariy the lioh canisters, to check that they are stowed according to the entry stowage list."
"casper, houston. how do you read?"
"hank, are you still here?"
"what? ii onfid 01 08 10 _7 cmp thol,_mbt i'd looked at everything. 01 08 10 _8 cdr not the cameras .... camera up."
"okay, jack. the moon now has an lpd angle of 10 degrees"
"okay, it's gonna be almost - by - let's see, we're 6 hours late and it's 3 degrees - about a 15-degree sun angle, john."
okay; i'm gonna have to roll to get the - to trim out.

"okay. burn complete. residuals: plus three balls 40, plus four balls 7, plus four balls 2, delta-v counter 102.1. over."
it really is. the ground - msfn says all solutions are converging.
"and, dave, as you know, the only thing we have to worry about, especially with regard to kicking dirt, the solar wind composition experiment, and the lrt which is pretty far away."
"okay, joe. we understand that."
"oh, good grief ..."
okay.
just let charlie slide over.
***ty k.
ok_.
yes.
"that's a good place for it to be. you have about 30 more seconds, don't you? cml° about 15 more."
"yes. just a couple of months with a lot of people. let's see, deploy the lec and the mesa - that's done. i'm looking at my mobility, eg shift. i have the decided impression i don't want to move too rapidly, but i can walk quite well. that cra - the surveyor really is sitting on the side of a steep slope, i'll tell you that. okay. now, i'll work on my contingency sa_nple. got to walk real careful, al."
"okay. 61, 64, and 48. and i have a p52 for you and a crew status report."
we'll hold off. go ahead with your strip.
yes.
"roger. trying to get reel 2 up to you, if you wan_."
okay. it's going in work.
"ail righty. turn around and let me get the sun on you, probably better. okay. okay, inside. okay. okay on the inside. okay, you're pretty clean on the torso. few on the hoses. not too bad. most of this stuff seems to be coming off fairly well - - 04 22 ll 55 i_z? yes. it comes off it it's not too - much rubbed in; if it's just laying there, it brushes zf.f well."
okay. i got a copy of the ... k ...
"no, sir. i'm timing it."
bats 1 and 3 to off slash reset.
okay. the hatch is closed and locked.
"that sounds like a good deal. now that's just one step back there. the trouble is, yours is hack under the rock compartment (laughter). here you go ..."
good. didn't want this vox to be too good.
"go ahead, houston."
we 're in egress.
"i'm not so sure we got a good fillet on this last one, so we might be willing to sample another."
"yeah. why don't you punch it off, so you - it's under your card, there."
that's affirm.
that is a high mountain.
"negative, houston. you broke. disregard. i'll (columbia) get them off the flight plans."
that's good. i feel like i'm praying. i guess i am.
"okay, the burn was on time. looked like it was about 2 seconds. delta-vgx was 0.7. roll was 132, pitch was 193, and yaw was 342. residuals after trim were zero - plus 0.1, zero, and minus 0.1, and delta-v c is minus 3.3. ox 007. fuel is 009 and decrease 50."
()kay. we will. we'll start the dumps right after the star check.

"okay. bob, lmp is getting purge 211."
"jim, could you give us a little help on the tilt, we seem to be hung up."
"okay, charlie. let's go back to the rover. put your bag on there and head out for the big rock because you got a bag on your back, and we'll use it."
wasn't that a 2 a minute ago?
"all right, i sure will. l0 seconds. b, 2, i -"
okay.
okay. (rra_q)
roger. sounds great.
"dee, reset."
"ken, can we roll to get this area back in the sun- light where we could have a better look at it?"
"negative. this is the procedure that they came up with. it's just a check, mike. everything's looking great to us. over."
"okay, john. looking at the pictures of the lift- off, and it appears that something might have come loose from the skin on the back of the vehicle, so for that reason, we want ken to take some pictures of the lm. so we have a slight modification ... the flight plan and ask you to do a yaw 360 after ken does his verb - verb 49 to the docking attitude."
what?
pitch is 083.
"it just looks like slump, probably."
"okay, go ahead with the p20."
"okay. and why don't we get you two guys together again, now, and break down the core and press on. and we've got a little revision here to the eva. i'll get with you in just minute on, as soon as i find out what it is."
"okay, copy that. 0k_y, and, ron, we'd like vo press on with our flight plan update here for you. c_ okay."
"ne can wait if you want us to, jim."
roger. that sounds like a pretty good idea. okay; we 'll do that.

"okay. i ought to be well ahead by then. if you'd like for me to wear the suit, why, it's no problem. i'm not requesting to wear it, but if you'd like for me to, why_ it's no sweat."

yes.

that's affirmative - -

"okay, can i pass it on to you so i can get - get on back to work here?"
"left hand ... okay, ... need to get out of here ..."

"that looks good, sir."
"copy that. _,,_ . . ._ day 7"
"okay. hank, why don't you go ahead?"
"houston, columbia. how about a go for logic bus arm."
"gordy, you want delta 1, 2, 3, and 4, and charlie 3 and 4 for damping. and you want bravo 2 and delta 2 for spinup, as the flight plan says?"
"endeavour, this is houston. we're showing your mapping camera not on at this time and are requesting it on. it may be just a reverify from your 198 plus 32 plus l0 on the flight plan. over. 08 06 4b 15 cmp roger, joe. p apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription"
"jack, when you get around, and we close this gate, you might try and hit that - top of that sep down again. lnp-eva i will."
that's correct.
we copy that. and what was the result of the vhf check; does it work okay?
"ckay, babe, we're coming to the first braking gate right on the money; no braking required. 05 23 09 34 cr_° okay."

"and the first finger i talked about was at 12 o'clock. it has joined the edge now and almost disappeared. the second finger was - still es- sentially the way it was - is getting slightly closer to the edge. there's maybe - oh, less than 1/32 of an inch between the tip of the finger and the edge. and it goes out at - at 2 o'clock. okay, from 3 o'clock on around to about 7 o'clock, the cells - it's in a shadow, and i can't see for sure if they're touching the edge or not, but it looks like they're probably essentially touching - the sk - the edge."
verify your circuit breakers - white dots - ... eva decals.
"you want - okay. i want the eva decals, also, jack."

"_nere we go. okay, 23. stop. that's good. that's 24. that's close enough."

is there anything we can do to help?
i think we'll do all right.
"actually, there's a bubble in each tube. and it's each tube has a bubble. they are in exactly the same place. they're lined up in a row, and they are directly over meter number 3. and the bubbles are about - oh, one-eighth of mn inch in diameter."
"okay, i had a quick - quick look and just to bring you up to date, we're starting to be able to see the coast of asia. the philippines are wide open today. and the - that tropical storm theresa that i mentioned i thought i could see - indeed, i'm sure that's what that little concentrated mass of clouds was north of new guinea. and, i suspect, although i didn't get a good fix on it, that the folks in guam may be in for some heavy weather."
"- - you might go out and start the photographic flow site, if that looks like a reasonable thing."
"we'll be with you in a moment, mike. _;tandby."
"ok_r, houston. how about a cue?"
"okay, secs logic, two of them are closed; secs arm, two are closed; els csm sep, hat a, bat b are closed. okay, els logic is on; els auto is on. okay, houston, you all set for the secs logic?"
okay.
"yes, that's the freshest we've seen. it's a great one."
take a look at those babies.
you can check that stuff when you go and close the hatch.
"oh, yes! it's a big - looks like a big block tilted up on its side."

i'll get the thing going here in a minute.

looks like a low might be developing on that one - a wave up in northern colorado and - although the clouds are a little hard to read.
...
"but it's almost the same size as grimaldi. it even looks like it is a little bit deeper, but, of course, grimaldi has considerable fill. grimaldi on its eastern edge has some of the graben, or it's rim, if you will, is cut by three or four anastomo- sing grabens that make it look like some of the bench areas in the larger basins."
"okay, tony. thank you."
"rot control power direct, two, off."
"tony, do you read? over."

good idea. that a boy.
"well, i thought you said - -"
"we are mounting upon the vehicle, as they say, houston."
yes.
yeah.
"this is put together by a - a mr. jim kokowsky [?] and it looks like he's done a pretty nice job of summarizing the news, so i'm going to read iu cold. and he's given us a summary of the late news. and the weather couldn't be worse in houston. it had to be better on the moon or in orbit around it. this morning more cold and drizzle blanketed the houston metropolitan area. yesterday morning it was 32 degrees. this morning a little warmer but a lot wetter, and it's getting colder on friday. on the national-_nternatienal scene: peace talks in paris between dr. henry kissinger and le duc tho have ended - at ]east for the time being. dr. kissinger is in washzington today to brief president nixon on the aa!ks. the past 3-1/2 weeks, the pair of negotiators havu held 58 hours of talks. neither side is giving out any hints. when asked about the cease-fire by christmas, dr. kissinger told reporters at andrews, ""i don't want to make any predictions."" the u.s. by sizeable vote has had its assessment to the fund of the united nations reduced by a vote of 81 to 27. the u.s. will now pay only 25 percent of the cost rather than the present 31 percent. transatlantic fares may drop beginning in febru- ary. the international air transport association says all carriers will set their own prices. it appears that air travelers to europe next year maj get some real bargains. in the hotly contested and federally supervised united mine workers cie tion, the insurgent candidate, arnold miller, has gone into a lead over incumbent president tony boyle. miller has ].ed a grass roots movement to oust boyle who took over the union control from the late john l. lewis. we mentioned the rather dismal weather in the houston area this morning, but the midwest and northeast are really gettlr- some bad weather. ice storms seriously hampered the northern part of the nation, from idaho to the eastern seaboard. after almost a year, troops involved in the india-pakistani war are beginning to go back to their homelands. truce-line mans have been exchanged and approved by both govern- ments. civil servants of the european common market, they're called eurocrats, are on strike. the 8000 employees walked off the job due to a salary dispute."
okay. i'm on 28 now.
have you got us a good area picked out? (goss net 1) tape 71/20
"yes, 3 - 330."
"okay, they're alined and adjusted and locked. 06 19 06 39 ixmp-iam 02 connectors, three?"
"and what kind of progress are you making now, jim."
"oh, it looks like it might be oscillating maybe 10 degrees at the most. _-_"
"i'm just coming on. did you happen to take a look at that docking latch? okay, i've just been told that's all squared away. so i don't - don't know of anything that needs to be done now before you go ahead with the integrity check."
"okay. this should be getting larger, smd if it is, it's the place we're coming 1ome to."
"yes, i noticed that too. yes, you can look down in the shadow of a - of a crater, where you got the sun down there, but if you hs_e more backlight- lng or something. you know, but you can - you can see that pretty good with the naked eye, anyhow. earthshine, now, about all i can get out of the earthshine, really, are differences in albedo. and you can get some - textural -well, not so much textural differences, but terrain bumps and humps, and flow fronts, and - see craters, you know?"
watch it. it drives it way out; there's no way to bring it back. just give me an update.

"()kay,we were reading ..."
okay; my water flag's clear .... cooling. min cooling. you might want to go to intermediate.
wouldn't that be cool?
"okay, ron, let me read through this one for you. they are anxious to extend that, but they want the data system, on_ so they can see i: first. _y don't you go to 196.20 in the flight plan? you're probably sitting there looking at it, anyway. and run through that block that's there. it starts at about 196:19. we told jack to mow_ it but since we're aborting this lunar sounder pass, let's go to 196:20 and carry out the ste_s _'nthere with the following exceptions: do not turn recorder or radar to off. okay. and, we want lunar sound_ left in standby."
"as mission scientists, you're totally responsible."
"yes, just a second."
and it's highly friable. it breaks apart.

okay.
let go of it. there.
roger.
"okay, i can dump it when i get here."
"okay. well, i had a feeling what i was seeing yesterday might have just been the remnants of teresa [sic], which i think went - got into that area a couple days ago. it was not a very well- developed system, but did seem - seem to be iso- lated from the other cloudiness that i would have put into the tropical convergence zone. that was between wake and kwajalein."
oh!
"bob, i'll - i'll give you my word. before we leave here, i'll make sure that the src is closed."

"yes. i'll try to hold the attitude we select directly, while you're giving us the coarse aline attitude. we're not too sure what - what's the best attitude. i'm going to ask jack again if 115 is sufficient for him."
"roger, john."

... out there.
"yes, sir. and then we'll go on down about four lines to the ""set delta-v"" and that should read: ""set delta-v c minus 100."""
"roger. speaking of that, the burn attitude's going to be 104 degrees, so you might keep that in mind when you get down here. you're getting kind of close to it now, or - beginning to get close to it."
okay; because it's setting - the outer edge of the bubble is at the outer edge of the black mark.
"roger, clipper. give us p00 and accept - - time skip"
"go ahead, 15."
you're right. (goss net l) tape 7/8
got a ... there isn't any place to put it though. it won't stay stuck.
"on, i can't get that cap on any more than that."
"okay. it's 278, 295, and 310. and the high-gain angles are pitch 11 and yaw 330."
...
yes.
yes. 06 21 42 29 i_4p-eva yes.
"okay, i got it. confide l"
"okay. we'll make sure of that. and i guess the problem with r-12 was that, once we got all the lm data onboard, we didn't have any place to put it, or else we didn't have any place to put the lm data. and if you have any better suggestions on where to put them, we'll be glad to do it."
okay. squelch a is setting at about 4.
okay. i'm set.
"can the lsg - the base of the lsg, be touching the soil?"
"roger. it looks like we're not going to have a decision on this rev, and we do have the capability of spending about five revs in this configuration before we have to make that decision. we would like y'all to move into a stationkeeping position, and you should be at the closest point of approach at about 100 hours, and we're recommending a csm active to move into a position and to stationkeep. and we're gonna run some simulations down here on this tvc problem, and we'll get back to you."
"- - the lmp. a couple of minor things on the back- side checkout. the secondary glycol pump, when i started it, the sound and the pressure was ragged, oscillated around - 20 psi, and then stabilized after about 15 seconds and sounded smooth. it had a sound as if it was cavitating a little bit, but after that, it was smooth. over."
okay. i'll do it on the comm at 192:b6:40. stand by-
okay. ail the rates are pretty well damped.
"yes_ don't know why they have that little hook. 0h, it's a safety wire."
"3,kay. descent eca and ec,a control, open."
got pitch zero.
it's sitting right there in the end of the track. there are tracks all over that hillside. there's a boulder came right down to the surface there. see it?
wha_ about h-dot?
"you can sure see those thrusters fire, can't you?"
"okay, 3 minutes showing to zero. 04 08 33 11 _p altitude's *** h-dot's right on, dave."

"oh, right in that particular local area."
yes. please. go ahead.

how does the connector look? is there any-damage on it?
there you go.
"rate scale, 5 degrees a second."
"yes. 06 00 40 18 i24p-eva - - near the crater. at least you'll get a com- parison. boy, those chevrons do a good job of compacting the soil."
yes. select best omni.
sep. don't worry about it. s-ii sep light out. not supposed to feel any ullage.
"okay; that sounds great, geno. press."
"now - now, prior to we go gpi, are we going to get anymore than that?"
"okay, houston. i've got a hard rock. i think it's glass coated, but it's so dust covered i can't tell, and it's going in bag 39_. 06 00 18 50 cc okay, 39_."
you mean tap on the thing that swings?
...
do you want to put - put this around them?
okay.
"how did this come off that thing? 05 00 37 08 l_5°-eva okay, it seems to - -"
"i need a - i need a sack .... wait a minute. ·.. going to eat them all now, make you ..."
the fires of africa. they're there. like he said. isn't that spectacular?
"okay, let's get this out. i24p-lm okay, the old lmp's plss. the ops stays where it is."
"there you go! let's pick this baby up and turn it around. 04 23 26 13 iaip-eva okay. ah, look at that!"

we'll turn it on.

keep talking. cdr-imm pressure integrity check. okay. plss 02 on. you ready for this?
okay.
"roger. at 95:33, we'll delete the ""po0 at pitch, 033."""
"okay. ]_4ags are caged. bus ties, jack?"
"right, the mode change worked."
i feel it running down my legs.
"okay. i'm back on the line now, but jack really .., headed back to the upstairs bedroom."
"apollo 16, houston."
okay. now give me the ...
"yes, should be. _ll 00 40 27 cdr so, if the sun is close to being behind the earth right now, maybe the earth will shield it."
"if you decide to swap headsets, we prefer that you swap with the cdr."
"okay. 0kay_ stow 70-millimeter, the hammer - okay, stuff that handle. i'm getting it right now. good godfrey. okay, src number 1 coming up."
"i was going to ask you, if you wanted one of those, fred."
now i lost my peanut butter .... i lose some of my peanut butter. .r .... page 137
yes.
"still stable, ron?"
yes.
okay.
"suggest maybe you just read off the circuit breakers you want us to power down. as you did yesterday, for us."
yeah.
"okay, now, let's see if we got it."
"okay, mine decayed about 0.2 - actually, it was a little less than 0.2 because i ran it for about - it for about a minute 20. 05 22 37 41 l_4p-lm okay, mine less than 0.2 - about l-l/2. okay, would you turn my oxygen on, please, john? yours is on."
enable.
"okay, gordy."
"dave and jim, we think you might be looking at earthlight now. it might be - its long dimension is greater than the east-west dimension. 05 23 26 44 izmp-eva okay, well that's certainly true. certainly true. okay, we would be - you would have us east of earthlight."
"okay. before you start copying, this procedure is - is basically simply to activate the super- critical helium pressure gaging so that you can _ead it. and the concern here is lest this supercritical helium pressure reach 1800 psi by 103 hours, at which point we'd be within a pos- sibility of rupturing the burst disk when you activate the dps. now, based on the pressure at launch, and based on a nominal rise time of about 6-1/2 psi per hour between then and now, the pres- sure should read about 710 psi. stand by, 13, until we get better comm."
"america, houston. as you come up on roll of 30, we'd like you to - okay, break, break - we would like the antenna i switched to off now."
there's the mains. okay. they're reefing.
"roger, buzz. first entry's on the eps under ac bus a. the line extends all the way to high gate. actually, the line should read - at doi it would be no-go ac bus a. after that the no-go would be both buses. so if you will just pencil in both buses from pdi through high gate, it'll be correct for that llne. over."
"ron, we'll be - no more flight plan updates we promise today and we'll be working - -"
"america, houston with a response to ron's question. over."
what percent?
i'll go ahead and do it now. what's going up this minute - coming up here?
wish i was there to watch.
- - an emu break.
there's 1. 1.5. 2. 2.5.
"well, you probably weren't; they probably just went that way."
"most of this stuff that we need to stow is in f-1 and f-2, i think."
"okay, cb(16) ecs: cabin repress, close. 05 06 l0 54 i24p-lm now, let me get around the - what am i hung up on?"
okay. i've got one little thing to take care of here next on my checklist.
okays. you have it.
"yes, sir."
inclusions like this one and that one.
okay.
"okay - okay, sounds good."
"pete, will you give us status the - on the lm and also some comments on your boot penetration?"
"okay, the crater i was talking about was a1-biruni - is the one that's got the swirls across coming from it. and then off in the northwest corner, just outside the rim, that's a very bright crater. it shows up on this - contingency chart. so that was a1-biruni. goddard's got a lot of - of swirls in it also. no, wait a minute. goddard was the one i was t-lking about, not a1-biruni."
"oh, i'ye got about an inch to go."
i - i think - i think that's the one.
"okay, houston. bat c is 37; pyro bat a is 37; pyro bat b, 37."
"okay, would you put the mapping camera to on?"
- - plus 1331. / _ that 's good.
what for?
"all right. at'ol,l,f) 11 a_i_-to-g][_oljl_d voice '['i_alisc[_]ptio_ (go:j:;ne'i'1) tape 53/1"
yes. imp i don't read me very well.
you could enter and load enif.
"i think it's too big, charlie."
okay; next.
"and i'm ready to give the pads, falcon, whenever you want them."
it's absolutely unreal.
next three are out.
"ron, can you see our suit-circuit pressure up there?"
"okay, ken. we're gonna lock up the radar on you."
roger. i can imagine.
"no, don't get underneath it. that a boy."
you'd just go - -
it is. you saved me a lot of work there.
"okay, henry. is that angle gonna be all right now?"
go up topside here and photo the other side of it.
affirmative. and we're ready for you to do it. go ahead.
"plss - okay, plss diverter on min, verify."
"that's affirmative. 09 23 18 02 cml° okay, hank. they - that's not the jet configura- tion they gave us this morning because i did have the sim bay jets - no, i'll have to look up those jets i had this morning, but bravo 1 was one of the ones i had turned on."
"it's generally about i percent between craters. but at the crater rims, it's up to about 5 percent."
okay. so we'll wait on that. but -
yes.
where is the what?
"okay, babe."
can you guys see the lm or are you down too far to see the lm?
okay. --_
sunrise'
okay.
copy that.
"okay. go down to 119:24 and add the following. let me just read it to you in - quickly here, so you can put in the words you want to. the words are ""point at target marked by lmp. use same technique as for copernicus central peak."""
it's there.
"okay, tony. looking off to the northwest there, you can see - see south ray crater with just tre- mendous amount of blocks on it with some black streaks, and here we go. heading 274, john."
okay.
yes. i agree.
"- - 20 seconds. endeavour, houston. in 15 sec- onds, you need to change the pan camera to mono. just a reminder."
that's good.
it's going to be one of those high - high - angle energy conversion roundouts.
"roger. step 8. we delete ""enable all jets,"" and what we record is the magazine percent. and that's the end of the correction."
"okay, bring it on. 07 05 b0 34 cmp logic i - logic 2. 07 05 b0 48 cc go for pyro arm."
"well, it was a little - little tight launch day. we'd - you know, fitted it pressurized, tony, and it felt okay then. launch day, i thought the legs were a little tight but not much."
that's affirmative. i am reading the numbers on our monitor here.
i just want it to sit here a minute. dick didn't roll good enough. i got to roll it. 0b 13 36 36 lmp it doesn't want to roll. ob 13 37 18 lmp 28500.
"all right, i will, but i'll hand it back to you."
roger. 03 06 56 t4 cml° we can't see any earthshine or any surface features at all in earthshine now due to the fact that the i_mis very bright and is causing our pupils to contract. it's a very fantastic view to see the terminator as you look along the edge of it. i think you'll agree that some of these craters that you're seeing in the picture now are really accentuated by the lengthening of the shadows as they come close to the terminator.
"circuit breaker logic power, two, close. two, close. logic power, two, to jettison. oh, i'd hate to do this."
go ahead. l_ip-eva it's bag *** 32.
roger.
"okay. number 1, we'd like to go hf 2 to extend for 3 minutes."
"okay, vance, how do you read the aquarius?"
what's over there?
okay.
"i don't think it's any deeper. a little softer maybe, maybe a little deeper. why don't i move this down here just a little bit closer, pete?"
"0kay, al. we're starting them over."
"okay. we'll buy what you've got on the dsky there, and we'd just like to go through an overall powerdown procedure, and in so doing we'll catch the ball and inverter and it will only take a few minutes. so are you ready to start on panel 117"
those ... will be firing all around you in a minute.
okay.
"charlie, i just retrieved it."
i guess we aren't going to be that far apart ... 04 02 04 b6 cdr i don't think so.
"have you checked the coas, pete?"
"yes. let me try, too. 06 20 13 44 ia_p-eva okay. 1, 2, 3. here it comes. 1, 2, 3."
"the blue ones. you won't be going, pete; i've been pretty good here, as a matter of fact."
"okay, that little set of 4 samples is in 527, barely."
17108 ob l0 bo lb lmp 17108.
i didn't know they had a hag with it.
"th_nks a lot, pete."
"you got what? cmp okay. (laughter) two grays, i mean."
"okay, stand by. we're just noticing the cabin temp here, and also that the outlet temp is up to about - the glycol about - outlet temp's up to about 70."
one second.
"okay, very good."
"okay, we got it."
yes. okay. i'll get the pan.
*** as far as it goes. must be armed.
"you - you didn't give me a verb 82, babe."
roger.
"all :right. let me give you a call when i get there, and when i'm alined and level. 05 14 56 33 i_mp okay, fredo, my plan: i'm out in the area of the boulder field; i'm going to photograph many of the boulders, the rocks, the broken ones, the big ones, what have you - and then, grab as many of the different fragments as i can around these piles of broken boulders. i - now that i'm here, i see a large number of inclusions - i can't tell whether they're crystals or not - i think that they are. and i'll grab as many of these - and give you be- fore and after shots as i can - of a whole weigh bag full of rocks."
"and, charlie, you want the fans cycled ... right?"
"okay, i guess - -"
digital manpower at work.
"get all your flaps? okay, hold your head down."
roger. just noticed that the mast that the eva light is on is charred brown. it looks as though it took quite a beating during launch.
"oh, i'll get the note in there. i'll get it in there. nobody will ever know."
standby.
thrust a's normal.
"copy that. and we'll see you in a couple of hcum;. we'll find out in a couple oi' hours. . l_ _. 17 i_4p-eva yes, i'll give _vou a reading on that before __on_:. i woul&n't eliminate station 8 for the world or the moon, whatever's _vailable today."
that's the way to do it.
"okay. okay, i'm out on the porch. just a second, gang, let me pull the pip pin. deploy the mesa. (jlg,,nfidentj iiib"
"charlie, is my visor down? i can't - -"
"okay, number 1 with the aft engine cover is bag _. and then the second line, it's bag 7. the third line it's bag 6 left hand and 5 right hand. _d the last line is bag 2 and 4. and you can dis- regard the max weights."
here we come up across the - -
okay.
turn around; hang on to this.
"well, it's not the seconal. as much as i hate to admit it, the power audio/tone was off (chuckle) in m_ headset."
"we see some small fresh craters. okay, meter size, that show some very fresh - at least, per- haps it's induration - indurated regolith. that's what it looks like, because it's - the little hard clods are the same inside the craters as on the rim."
"look out that thing in the daytime, you ... see ... terrible."
"okay. bat 5, normal, lm - - 04 02 41 14 cml° roger, ed. stand by 1."
houston; america. roger. we'll do our best.
"hello, america; this is houston. how do you read? cnp attitude? yes, 65, 60, 8. yes, we're in attitude."
"yes, why don't you pump it up again to 3.7."
roger.
"altitude-velocity light. ,; (eagle ) /,"
okay. i - i can probably get down on my knees and get - it's underneath its little box - -
"yes. mine's coming up, too. feels real good."
steady at about 4.6.
got it.
okay.
okay.
you want the laser altimeter on while we try to retract that?
roger. and that - that location was where again?
"stand by, al."
"okay. do a 180 here, and we'll check all the conne ctors. 05 22 05 25 cdr-i_m okay. okay, read to me."
"oka_ya i copy on that one, jack. cdh-eva ... start o._ 12 o'clock - 12 o'clock; mud i'm going lo work my way up to hole-in-the-wall and from there on up_ right?"
not much more; i'm hitting the ceiling.
roger. 211.
what?
"bob, do you have tv?"
"gordy, there is one minor weather disturbance, pos- sibly just about over puerto rico or maybe just - just to the east of that island. no strong circu- lation patterns, although there's a hint of a cyclone development. there might be just a small depression in that area. i don't know whether your maps are carrying anything down there or not."
it's off. engine off.
okay.
"we think your state vector was fairly accurate, ken. and you'll be at perilune in 15 minutes - -"
30 percent.
off.
"bob, the first block i looked at here looks like subfloor gabbro."
got her.
"okay, bob. i'm back up now and i'll stay with you."
"ken, would you shut the 0ps off? we show 5.5."
okay. thank you. glad to hear the system's (columbia) looking good. you have a suggested attitude for me? this one here seems all right. j 04 07 25 15 cc stand by.
let me see how detailed they want it.
"that's probably a prim - i don't know whether that's a secondary or primary, though."
okay. directs are on.
okey-doke.
"aaah - could read some numbers. and see how - why don't you set that clock to docking - to undocking - that would help. .imp okay. cml° hey, challenger - -"
"that - john, that fan's giving a lot of circu- lation. look at - watch this."
"yes. saw a flash, but i didn't hear it. gosh, i used to hear them all the time. huh!"
"okay. good, joe. 04 l0 52 ll cdr-seva okay, joe, our bearing to icarus is 338."
okay. telmu says that's okay; no problem.
roger.
nothing uptown about that.
going out and turning them around. did you get all of that?
did you - -
what's this bag here?
"okay; this is a - looks like a darker, fine-grained, black, vesicular basalt, with vesicles on the order of millimeters. nonuniformly disb - distributed. there are a mass of plagioelase about 3 millimeters long, and it may be a half a millimeter wide, ran- domly oriented throughout. and that's about the only other mineral i see. and that - did you get the number on that, jim?"
"okay, 17. continuing after being rudely inter- rupted by the omni switch, the state high school football playoffs here in texas are underway and - with a whole host of games scheduled this weekend. and the final item, the major league baseball players' association and the commissioner's office are going at it again. it must be getting close to spring training time."
"i sure missed hearing it click, but they are locked. one of them is, anyway. hey, jack. i verify - -"
... p40.
copy that.
"okay, jack. i guess that you - we're not quite sure what you said or meant there - or what - what it is. in the flight plan itself, we want h2 heaters 1 and 2 to auto, and we want h2 fans, on tank 3 only, to auto. they're three there for h2 tank 3. okay. you're teaching me to read carefully early, aren't you?"
"good readback, ken."
"well, we're just about done here. mag foxtrot f- into the etb. get everything you needed out of the - your seat pan?"
"okay, ed."
"stereo - no, wait a minute - mono."
"now, that's interesting .... looked at that once."
"okay, let me turn the card. can you go forward, jim? 06 19 16 14 imp-lm yes."
okay. then it's my understanding you don't want to do any dumping until i go on the back side of the moon. is that correct?
"this thing would really be great in shirtsleeves up here, you know it?"
"roger. _p houston, glycol pressure is 22."
(}kay. %inat's set.
"yes, if we can dodge and land, that's great."
"okay, jim. and just an added note on that. as you're well aware, we're interested in cleaning up as many of those fine glass particles as we can, which is primarily the reason for - for this procedure. 02 01 53 36 ijqp yes; we quite agree, joe."
"okay, and then what? okay. okay. i'll get off of the headset now then."
"it's - it's above the - okay. are you familiar with the minus 4 being halfway through the sky part, huh?"
"roger. four of those steps down at 245:30 we want to do right away, if possible. we want to --_ get the ""s-band aux, tv to science."" we want the ""data syst_{on switch to on."" we want to ""dis- able all jets except - ""and we want ""x-ray ex- periment, on."""
there you go - and they're locked.
"suit circuit relief, close."
and you might watch - your accumulator's going to cycle in about 20 seconds here. let's see what happens on the master alarm.
i'm sorry. ambient is 1620.
now for the fun in back (laughter).
"okay. yes, i understand that, bob. that's a good point."
"no, we got a little - - time skip"
careful when you undo it.
"no, we can figure that out, probably."
oh.
"charlie, that's - we want to reverse - -"
okay. i got that done.
"okay, step 2, change _'audio, l_,_,"" to ""audio, both."" change line 2 to reaa ""¥_ifb and vhf a t_ansmitter and receiver, off."" then step 4, acd, after ""secondary s-bai{d transmitter and receiver, open,"" ""secondary power amp, open, a_d delete ""primary pi.'_r al.[p,open."" then step 5, delete three lines snd add ""connect ln/cm umbilicals. :' over. 07 09 56 32 12._p ©kay, what was that last one?"
"that's over at 146:33, where you - they want you to put shield on center. after you have it on center, take it up oace momentarily for one step increase in gain, and then leave it on center."
"yes, sir."
"okay, i got a tone again, bob. i got a tone again."
"go ahead, ron."
not yet. we're on an omni.
"good eye, good eye. lmp-ev& big white clast - in the two-cy - in the gray- matrix breccia."
yes.
"thank you, charlie."
"roger; copy. 01 10 07 42 hmp and john's, 0ps was 5800 and mine was 6000. over."
okay.
this is houston. roger. out.
"copy that. okay. when you guys get done with that rock, we'd like to get to the rake sample, please. and that's probably just as well done by the rover as anyplace else."
okay. i can tell that you're just getting - getting that one over because jim just got off the loop.
here's a couple more.
"okay, sounds good."
yes. you sure are.
"and, john, do yom want to get that? and don't walk towards the lpm there, charlie."
ok_t. it's off.
go ahead.
"jack, the way the amps are going to look when you put the charger on is the function of the state of the charge of the battery. and what you de- scribed is about what we'd expect, considering where the battery should be. lnp okay; that's what i figured. it's up about one and three-quarter amps now."
you'll know when we get there.
dse is now running.
"still in a cobbley area, with boulders up to a meter. just like - looks just like our last stop. this is a shallow saucer area, but there's no boulder to sneak up on."
"yes, go ahead. it looks pretty good to us."
"looks like you're in pretty good, charlie."
i don't like that. i don't like that. i want to reject it.
roger. go.
never been on a ride like this before.
"oh, well. there's still ... - -"
okay. 0b 06 35 09 cmp ... about 187
"don't hurry, i'm getting my - going to get my ev- cb batteries still."
2- 272:38.
okay. that's go.
okay. it's back to supercrit. rcs. looks beautiful.
"how far down are we on the dps configuration card, now? down to - -"
four. five.
roger. go for loi.
"yeah. 65 and 110; 105 - 110 and 120; off-scale low, off-scale low; and off-scale low, off-scale low."
"okay; a piece of the glass from it, bob, is 546."
forty-one? and we just started 42?
"jack, ... the lpd on the moon now is 22 degrees."
"john, can you turn that over by yourself?"
"radar test, landing."
"okay, joe. apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription 08 02 18 -- begin lunar rev 60"
"yes. no, ... 03 03 58 59 iaip yes."
yes.
that's what i thought. that cap stays on.

"and, falcon, this is houston. in a few minutes, while you're stowing the etb, we'd like for you to pick up the magazine and frame counts on the magazine from your two cameras, please."
"houston, can you give us a holler when these rates ge_ good enough to start ptc?"
"oh, let's see now. there it is. mag karen is in."
"okay. ob 08 b5 10 cc america, switch to omni alfa. ob 08 b7 b8 cc america, houston. i have the morning news at the convenient time."

yeah. let me get _v - let me get my little scratch pad out here and let you give a kind of a summary - of major events anyhow.
"roger. we'd like to have you put the window shades on, as usual, but leave the cabin lights bright. and what we're going to do is to sort of calibrate one crewman in terms of the degree of _-_ a dark adaption required to see the flashes. that would be interesting to know. after you don the eyeshades and give us a mark and go ahead and count things, after a while, you - one of you - and we prefer you, dave, just to be specific - can expect for us to call'up to you to take off the eyeshade for i minute. and after a minute we'll do the timing for you, if you like. we'll tell you to put it back on and, in this minute time, look around at the lights, get back to sort of - your eyes normally adjusted, then put on the eye- shade again, and - and give us marks as you start seeing things. and that's - that's the only dif- ference from the normal procedure. we would - we would prefer to have all - all the data on the voice down link, if possible."
"al, watch your tv cable."
"that's surprising climbing those hills, too. could you hand me the cameras over there, jimmy?"
"okay, d.r. i,m ready to try it again. you've deleted at 247:28 the line with all the funny number ones, and you're suppose to delete in the dap load coll,m_ also that same entry. it's in the time collmmn, i guess. and then turn the page."
"okay, i presume that we'll at least have the sin- gle upper core which we can use to sample of that stuff in the soil, and we -"
jim?
"hey, if you want to use the 250? there's a beautiful shot of tsio]kovsky which we very seldom have."
"next one's in, descent eca, and the last one's in. and that should be all. _- day 4 page 139"
yeah.
"yes, i'm at my relief pressure now."
... 06 18 57 48 _ i bet he has some russian name. now you can see the - - time skip
"okay. next. okay, bob, we've got - -"
... they give us 2 minutes to dump.
"well, it's ""the week before christmas and all through the i_m,not a commander _as stirring, not even cernan. the samples were stowed in their places with care, in hopes that with you, they soon will be there. and cernan --gene in his hammock and i in my cap, had just settled our brains for a long - short lunar nap. but out on the - up on comm loop there rose such a scatter, i sprang from my hammock, to see what was the matter. the sun on the breast of the s_mrface below gave the luster of objects, as if in snow. and what to my wandering eyes shoui_ appear, but a miniature rover aj_deight tiny reindeer. and a little old driver so lively and quick, i knew in a moment, it must be st. nick. i heard him exclaim as he - over the hills he did speed. merry christmas to all and to all - to you all godspeed."
...
"okay. i've gone through the battery charge, the lm vent valve, the fuel cell purge, and then stop ptc at 55 hours, and your roll attitude there will be 285 degrees, which is per the flight plan. the high gain antenna angles are slightly different, pitch 23 and yaw 267 degrees. the tv pass till 55:30, the standard lm acti- vation except for some special steps we'll give you to take a look at she tank pressure, which i don't have yet. restart ptc at about 56:30 or whenever you're through with the _4 activ- ities, and after that, at your convenience, we'd like you to - to do the p52 option 3 that we cancelled at 54-1/2 hours. over."
okay.
"make a great ski area, if they'd just put some snow on it."
"hey, jim, i saw the landing site as we passed over it. we're not going to have any trouble recognizing it from the rays. the rays stand out beautifully."
okay.
what do you want? for the rover?
"oh, me."
"hey, is the zoom in too much, gordo? you - let me take it out a little bit."
... apollo 11. go ahead.
no. my brain is seeing them when you're not.
that's why you're an astronomer.
"(clears throat) i'll get ... 00 03 16 !3 cdr okay, which button you going to use to sep with? right there. want me to sep for you?"
and let me get the down-sun which - -
no. no one's asleep now.
"okay. the - the thing we got to do when we get through here is i want to be sure that there's a - we're gonna come in the last thing we started and we said at the time we hit $ep, i start my clock, and - and then at - -"
i don't know how we can get that in.
maybe you ought to put yours down there. save a little time.
"roger. we copy. and we recommend that you go ahead and complete your tvc test on board. if you have problems, we'll talk to you when you get around further into the high gain antenna attitude. over. 0b 02 53 12 cdr roger."
we're getting a little vibration during this burn.
"okay, don't bother to read the angles."
... pictures. do we just take them from straight down?
"now, help me get the - easy does it. go easy."
"now, if i c_m remember where i put r_ycamera bracket."
"apollo 15. omni - omni-delta please, and we'll go to charlie a little bit later."
"bob, this is jack."

pretty interesting.
"roger, buzz. the attitude that we're in right now is a convenient one to start p_'c in. we'd be satisfied with this attitude. [.owe'd jike you to disable quads charlie and d_lta; and we'll wait about 5 to 10 minutes, and than we'll es- tablish the ptc. over."
"hey, dick, it never fails to do that. i'll be goddaw_ed if i know. we're talking _o you fine up _ntil 1 minute, and then you can't hear me. now, it could be that, when i'm burning, my thrusters are doing something that's blocking that vhf."
"yeah, it's hard. but it's gonna come - i'm gonna get a piece - of it."
"oh, i don't think he'll have any confusion with that."
"no, they had just as soon you leave it the way it is, because if it's broken, you may not be able to - to get it off again, and then that would foul up the undocking."
"putting all the good things up, huh?"
"oh, i see. well, that's not bad."
yes .... put the garbage in here all ...
"yankee clipper, houston. one minute to los. and we'll be giving you a p22 pad at aos. yankee clipper, houston 30 seconds to los."
"okay, ken. i guess what you're trying to say is when you get too close to the forest you can't see the trees, huh? 06 09 56 57 cm_ that must be."
okay. i'm going to cabin-egress.
"okay, ed. pitch looks like it's about minus - 12, yaw is 180, and the agc peaked when i switched to narrow and it's dropped off now to three- quarter full scale."
there's a very large depression in a - ahead of it.
"okay, 13. we're not quite ready yet. we'll give you a call when we're ready."
"okay. we know when you went to 15 last night on primn,ry. we want to switch out today at 7.6. let me check and see ii'we're ready. 03 21 24 111 lmp okay."
go ahead.
yes.
"and, you know, the fragment population out here only goes out to maybe 200 meters, i expect."
and that's a walter mitty plan number 2.
"roger, jim. the p30 pad. purpose, doi trim, rcs/g&n; 38264; noun 48 is na; 095:56:42.50; plus 0003.1, last two noun 88s [sic] are 0; 180, 104, 359; noun 44 is 0059.4, plus 0009.6; 0003.1, 0:20, 0003.1; 30, 192.8, ll.1; rest of the pad is na. gdc aline stars are vega and deneb; roll, pitch, and yaw are 288; 340; 346. it's a four- jet rcs burn, and we do not want to trim any retrograde residual. so any extra burn you get in that direction, we will not trim. over."

roger. did you survive?
yeah.
"we've got a - i guess probably the continent of africa dominates the world right now. it's cover- ing the - oh, the upper third - upper and western third of the - of the world. we can see the sinai_ we can see up into the mediterranean; we can see across the mediterranean, although we can't quite make out the countries up there; we can see across into india. i catch a glimpse of australia out in the far horizon. got zanzibar on the southern tip of africa, the cape do_m there just almos_ directly below us. and, i don_t know exactly how bi_ antarctica is, but i guess we can cer_ainiy see more than 50 percent of it. and - the rest of it is all ocean. the indian ocean out into the pacific ocean and back into the at]antic ocean. and for the most part relatively clear of clouds except in the antarctica region, and up towards europe which is - which is on the horizon, across the mediterranean, it looks like there might be some clouds back up in that way. i probably - probably - well, not probably - i can make out the entire coast of africa from mediterranean around to the west, coming back to the south back where it takes its big dip to the east, back around the cape, back around up through the suez canal, almost perfectly."
okay; the pin is in. it's closed; you're in low flow.
get it up on top of the pile.
"and, jim, why don't you take a breather and tip it up for us, please. thank you."
"pete, can you put tool e down there?"
"yes, sir; we are with you."
"yes, sir. the temperatures on the batteries are 96 and ll0."
"okay, here we go. in general, all orbital science experiments are working very well, and we have some very happy principal investigators. the x-ray pi reports count rates higher than expected, which gives good facial resolution. real-time data shows a signature of magnesium, aluminum, and silicone, so far. and appear to be differences cropping up between the mare and the highlands. the mass spectrometer pi reports good operation with many peaks appearing, and so far they've clearly iden- tified neon and argon. ga_na ray is happy, with improved data since separation of the lm - and spectral features are appearing in the data. the alpha particle experiment reports seeing a radon peak over procellarum - and possibility of some other peaks over other areas of the moon. i'll let you know about - more about that later. the photo team tells us - the photo team tells us that the mapping camera is working well - and the laser is going great. the pan camera appears to be getting about 80 percent of its frames in good - in good quality despite the v over h sensor prob- lem. and in general, they say, ""keep up the good work. it's looking great."""
forget it.
"okay. they're unsnapped. no, they aren't, either. you want them unsnapped?"
you noticed!
"roger. we copied in the p22 attitude that you will not be able to get a high-gain lo¢:kon. we have a dap data load, if you're ready to copy. over."
okay. my thing's going right down.
roger.
"and, charlie, while you're up at that boulder, if you can, get - -"
"we got a picture now, charlie, and it looks real good."
okay.
coming down. 05 11 07 19 i2_p okay. there's 4.5. 4. 3.5.
"roger, tranquility base. 04 09 35 03 iamp that's about ready to fall off. (tr_q )"
want a bag?
"hey, houston; 15 in the blind. the ems and g&n agree within about 10 miles."
stand by for seco. 00 00 12 15 _ all the systems stuff. you got to ... seco. 00 00 12 18 cml° yes.
... nice and close on the inside.
turkey?
"let's take a shot of cold air and chill _own, if you don't - cold water ..."
"anytime we stop, joe, i'll let you know (laughter). /f"
okay. if you head into that little - well that's a crater there.
...
"on the rear detent, the radar can be pointing (tranq) plus-x, and i'm - i'll be using right rear. that 's okay."
"okay. that sounds good, charlie. 05 08 ]l 30 cdr-i_m yeah, i believe charlie - i think charlie's right about that."
"ooh - what the hell is he looking at, dick?"
got it.
"be with you in a minute, jim. i've got to torque another 90 degrees or so."
roger. copy.
"okay, the dsky and ems look good. still in the tight limits."
"okay. stand by. stand by. stand by, please."
there wasn't any signs of k0h anywhere. - -
"houston, tranquility. be advised we've got - - (tranq)"
"i got - i think i've been fooled by that, too_ and that's why i estimated the ... time."

jim finally let me look out.
yes.
"yes, i've seen them."
you hear m_ vox cut in and out? good.
"you know, i've just been up out of the leb for a short time here, and itm trying to find out which country we're over."
"okay, the first star: the corrected altitude, 15 kilometers plus or minus 4; effective altitude, 12 kilometers plus or minus 7. as far as the substellar point, the value is arc-minutes - 2 arc-minutes, and that's very good. and, like i said, we'll get back with you in a couple of hours for the rest."
"okay, let me get the -"
"yes, mike. we show you in verb 59 right now. over."
"al, in 30 seconds we're coming up to a pan camera operation mode, standby, power on."

... get them all out. okay.
"roger, joe. understand. at 201:30:21. that's 20 seconds after el, off, we get the mapping camera, off and the laser, off. · z"
right.
any of them. i - have put in the commander's circuit breaker and still have not gotten any- where with it.
... going off?
"no - no, i'm sorry. in fact, i've got to tighten up your -"
and have you hit proceed on this display to enter the zero?
"yes. *** soft white inclusion again. it breaks pretty easy. oh, it's got to be a dike. look at that."
okay; copy that and - -
roger that. (columbia )
"go ahead. iafp gordy, i figure you're getting an optics briefing ready for me, right?"
"well, you can see where - -"
"sure does, that net."
"number - number 7, houston."
"here is that. we got one rock box coming up. okay, al. easy does it; easy does it. wait a minute, now. easy does it. easy, easy! easy! easy! easy! you're pulling when i don't want you to pull. okay, now pull. okay, now we got to give it the heave-ho, ready? 1, 2, pull."
"hello, houston; hello, yankee clipper; intrepid's up vox."
"okay, understand that's complete."
roger. (laughter) apollo 17 air-t0-ground voice transcription
that's fine. we can still see.
"yes, it really is, you know. it's really all your eggs in one basket, boy. i got to thinking about that after you guys left for your descent. once you start that descent, man, that - that's it - -"
"john, we'd prefer you wait until after the sextant star check. ot 05 57 07 cdr okay."
"and - got a ways to go. we want to get the lm data kit, in r-3. okay, ac - -"
okay. go.
"get is 162 hours 0 minutes; rcs total 60; quad a: ·60, 60, 59, 61; hydrogen tanks: 65, 64, 46; oxygen tanks: 71, 74, 58."
"okay. i'm just going to stick these cards here in the compartment then, and - -"
huh?
okay. let her go in 10 seconds.
let's see what's over on your right. let's see if we can get at that scarp over there.
"oh, roger."
okay.
"it's not that far, but i think, like if we go due west of the lm, we can go 300 meters. and we'll probably run into some really big boulders, which are probably in the center of the ray, and then they thin out a little off to the other side from the ray. i think we're in about ..., and it probably runs over that way for a good long ways."
"yes, put them down there ...."
this velcro just doesn't work. i just come right up off it.
roger. _nat's the one. 0t 06 32 ¢1 ct okay. it looks like he's moved the camera at this time.
"okay, houston, out of five - 06 02 52 gl cc - - we had a couple of amp ... zero."
okay. image motion - let's see - i think that was barber pole plus three before. there it is. 3 - _ -
one.
"stand by .... ok 15 02 40 cmp okay, jack. one question from jim is, he wants to know whether the procedure has been tried ... 'i'a_e 75] 2 _ u_ 04 _, okay. try it again, now, jack. what did jim want to know?"
how are the srcs doing?
...
ok_. reach.
okay.
yeah.
yes.
am i hitting the antenna?
"***30, geno. it looks good, babe. ***2; altitude is right on. h-dot is very close."
"okay. that's mainly for jack to be able to get it in the optics, you ]aean."
"roger, ed."
"okay, and ir can come off. and the uv, 0ff; ir cover, closed. s-band aux tv, off. off, yes. and data system, off. through with the old flight plan. let's check and see if we've got those other two items first. i think we do. yes, that was one."
"okay. 203. okay, why don't we take some of tho_ flight plan changes here?"
"- - a rounded, as well as angular - the angular boulders are probably from south ray. and maybe the rounded ones are - are working their way out of the regolith here. so that may be a cue to our - to our getting descartes."
okay. 2_s and the dsky are within about 10 feet per second. track at 638. tight limits.
i see them.
"hous - houston, on the aft _m_i. how do you read?"
minus 42. minus 15. just a little glitch.
"houston, are we clear to do the p52 now?"
okay. 05 21 50 20 i24p ... good. il it confidenti/ 6 05 21 50 21 cdf okay. thank you. about 225 to go; out of plane looks good. 05 21 50 29 l_ it looks good. that's good.
"oh, that's better. ?nere."
roger. out.
go.
#*# up?
okay.
okay.
fire.
"okay, see if the other one is in. see if you can't get it. okay; stop pull. 04 23 21 27 _p-eva john, i went just out of minimum on my cooling unit, and it feels a lot better."
"yes, yes. there are a lots of little fragments over there by that area - ha, ha."
"you know, other than the large-size rocks - very, very difficult to determine a contact around here."
"- this rock in this bag, if we put it this way?"
"roger, dave. we copy - copy your comment loud and clear. we're receiving you clearly. we ii confidenijlj l da6y agree, we don't have anything from jim yet, and we're looking at it now. 05 21 3_ 35 cdr okay, hous - -"
"okay. at 164:45, we want to do a p52, option 3, and gdc align."
"... hold this tv or sc_ething; i shouldn't have got it out, because i can take pictures."
"16, houston. the booster looks good. it's reconfigured for orbit."

roger.
"okay. and second one is with respect to the optics cals. and i guess we should explain here that - people who are wringing their hands down here about the fact that we looked at a little bit of a bias drift when you guys zeroed the optics the first day, and we sent up some procedures yesterday say- ing to be careful when you are doing it for p23. and then everybody else got - decided that we ought to be careful when we did it for other things be- sides p23. and so, we have the following procedures, which are, basically, to avoid trunnion rates for all optics zeroing, so that we don't get any - pos- sible shift on the mirror calibration. and the procedures are nwofold. first i guess you might write them down some place -- if the optics power is off, place zero switch off before turning the optics power on. and then, after the power is on, drive the optics manually to a trunnion of less than l0 degrees before placing the zero switch on. over. 02 22 39 28 _ okay, bob. if optics power off, then optics zero switch, zero?"
for t-2.
do i?
"from this distance, the color is very much the same as it was when we were orbiting it. /'_d that is that no three men on any one crew can agree on what the color really is."
"how are they doing today, bob?"
about the same size as neper.
"okay, i'll torque it to 845."
i knew it would. and that - -
"let me have the color one, and i'll try to pull it out and get the others."
"jack, you should be reading bat c voltage. that circuit breaker should be open."
"ok_r, thank you. 03 01 0t 50 cmp don, we're gonna waste the two frames of vhbw. could you tell me if it's better to - to use ss or tt?"
okay. my - my 02 hose has sort of drifted up there.
yeah.
"jim, whenever you're through eating and ready to copy the info, i can send you the burn rules."
"and, tony, your comment on this pallet - the locking - on the tool harness - the locking ring on the pallet doesn't stay up every time. it's slightly inconvenient, but no big deal."
okay.
yes. that's it. must be it.
"and we knew all the time, dave. we should have told you. wanted to keep you honest, though."
"roger, al. could you give us a sample bag number and then press on? 05 12 37 t8 lmp okay. well, we didn't take a sample there. the couple that we did take a sample of previously are the same types, so the last couple of samples have been of the same type rocks that we're dis- cussing. _ 12 37 130 cdr okay, houston, i'm coming up on bench crater right now. i loped off and left al. and i'll get you a pan in bench crater. this looks like a very in- teresting crater; it's different. oh, and i see some really different rocks - a big one. hey, that looks like bedrock. gee, what a cra_er. wow. oh, boy. hey, al, look at - come on over here. 05 12 38, 01 _.2_ i'm corning. {15 1'2 35 03 cdr ougiit to get some of this. let me get some cans in there. 0[ 12 35 10 cc sounds interesting, al. and, pete, sounds as though 'you're getting down to bedrock. is that affirm? 2,5 l_ 28 13 cdr yes. they got to be bedrock, and this one in the bottom is - as a matter of fact - - c> 12 38 19 _ _oy, there's some big fragments around here. 2,[51f 38 20 cdr - - get the pictures, it looks to me like stuff is melted in the bottom of it. i - can't swear that, but i'll get you some pictures. starting right now. f:8 - b - i - fix. okay. let me go ever on the other - little bit here. get you a good p._. 05 12 38 53 _._ yes. this rock looks pretty much the same from a distance, houston. c5 12 39 _jo _r yes, there's - - 2,5 12 39 01 _._/cdr soil."
"okay, and, jack, i copied - aside from three trench samples, i copied one single rock - one single bag of basalt samples. is that correct?"
"(laughter) okay. that's pretty good. i was going to say about 200 kilometers, i-think_ is what it is, but - - cmip that's right."
(laughter)
okay -
"al, just pull those hoses around like this. that's the boy; that'll do it. all it does is block that whole freaking area,"
... okay ...
"it's up, henry."
"..., houston. data is back now good, and everything looks fine as we come up 20 seconds to los. we'll see you at carnarvon at 52:b9."
"okay. okay, karl. understand."
"that's affirm. you'll have a, b, c, and d en- abled for step 7."
okay. let me know when - -
"yes, that view right from this window. look at that."
thank you.
okay; i'm swinging around now. let me check you. shoot.
"houston, america. the mapping camera and laser altimeter covers are closed. i'm going to enable a-l, a-2, and c-2."
...
that's right. go ahead.
"aquarius, houston. we'd like to have apt omni, and we're going to lose contact with you for about a minute here while we try to establish tracking. and our latest data shows that your closest approach to the moon is going to be 60 miles perigee. over."
okay.
"copy. plus 002.69, plus 109.31, plus 004.70 [sic]. over."

"and, you must have dropped comm there, joe. that's what we're in the process of doing here. after i dust your eye off."
"wait a minute. b re - transmitter to off and b receiver, on."
it's your ops hose time.
any time.
"okay, tony. pan is complete, and i'm - i'm up t¢ 165 on magazine mike."
"roger, dave. we hear you on that. a similar question, was the drill torque high while you were - drilling?"
"hey, i don't need the numbers anymore."
okay. get him back on the front. i'll tell you what i'm going to do. okay. let's go - wait a minute .... can you get the tool off my back?
okay.
"boy, that was a - good stroke."
"okay. in absence of any thermal problems, this soo x-1 we're in now is going to run until 270:30."
that appears to be a lot better now. %ye're still not receiving buzz's audio.
no - shut down early.
"houston, tranquility. we're not sure that we (tranq) got number 2 tank to fire. it's still showing a high pressure."
roger.
"okay. on the north massif, we've got very ob- vious boulder tracks. a couple of large boulders come within 20 or 30 feet of the - looks like where we can get to them, but there's a couple - there's a couple i know we can get to. well, the sun angle is such that, what i saw on the south massif earlier i can't see very well. but, i know there were boulder tracks over there. the - bare mountain - boy, it's hard to look to the east - bare mountain and the sculptured hills have a very, very similar texture on the surface. the sculptured hills is like the wrinkled skin of an old,_zld, 100-year-old man - is probably the best way i could put it. very, very hummocky, and - but smoothly pockmarked. i do not see any boulders up by the sculptured hills from here. but it's awful hard to look to the east and to the southeast."
low level.
"okay, i'm just about overhead now."
"okay, 17. ron, you can go to block now. you've got your ptc refsmmat. you're free to do a p52 option 1, if you want. and, be advised we are suspicious from time to time you may have an open mike there."
"endeavour, houston. we're ready for auto on the high gain please."
"can you see any detail in this picture now, or am i blocking out too much of the sunlight?"
"buzz, buzz, this is houston. do you read? over."
"okay, we'll get it. 08 22 14 xx begin lunar rev 66 fzd of tape apollo 17 air-to-groui_d voice transcription"

"eagle, houston. we've lost the high bit rate. would you please select low bit rate? over. 04 05 23 52 _ you got it. (eagle)"
... feel tired quicker because we don't have any- thing to push against. seems like ... - -
roger. 08 05 15 52 cml° will it be too crowded for that?
shoot.
"okay, will do. and also, let me ask you a ques- tion. in this configuration, docked, we have to use the ttca to control pitch and roll. and, just how much can we use that without really changing our trajectory? we only have 60 miles to play with."
and lmp plss data looks good down here.
"no, i guess not. rather, this must be - our old friend, the cayley floor."
before i forget it.
... that's it.
"yes, you can walk a bit more slowly than you're walking, jack."
okay. copy that.
"houston, i don't think there's any hope for using this leveling device to come up with an accurate level. it looks to me as though the cup here that the b-b is in is now convex instead of concave. over."
"roger, 15. if you guys will give us a hack when you start the first mass spec retraction, we'll keep an eye on those 20-minute periods for you."
"ok_y, we copy that; 2 minutes. and on the tube 1, did you notice any separation of the two sizes?"
"okay; understand. we do have a procedure here. we'd like for you to mess with your steerable antenna a little bit, there."
open on the way out. roger.
"okay, page 5-5, middle left-hand column. delete ""stow im ecs lithium hydroxide in bracket aft of engine cover."" and bottom of the page - - 05 10 31 10 lmp-im go."
just a minute. i'll be right back there -
"35 - not back on profile, but almost. o4 o8 23 17 lmp-_ - - ..."
those guys will die (laughter). they're down there - -
let's load oscar oscar in there to see if it will work.
"yes, i didn't put - -"
"you'd never know i hit it three times and it didn't, and, all of a sudden it just did, when i was up there doing the other."
look at - -
"let me see here. stand by. no. z guess you've been bouncing around there enough. we don't need _o stir vhem. _ it won'_ har_ them, will it? ta_e 123/15"
- - and we want a rake sample near the rover - -
okay. i got those.
yes.
five.
yeah. i think they are.
... kind of hard.
page 2 - -
yes.
stand by.
did you? you all right? iaip-eva yes. *** hammer?
why don't you - can you - want to take this bag off of me?
okay.
what do you mean; probe locked?
"go ahead, houston."
"water? 06 05 38 07 i2_p-lm ... water, it's been blowing out my - helmet duct."
"well, charlie. your ... turned sideways. no, that won't slide down. it is."
"okay, we copy that. you first described the muley rock as a crystalline and then switched to a - correction. you first described it as a breccia, then switched to a crystalline. i wonder if you could have some third or fourth thoughts on that? 05 08 24 34 iaxp-ir well, it was - i'd say when i picked it up, it was pretty dust covered, and only had a couple of spots to - that i could look. one area looked like a crystalline rock. there was a - if it was - if it were a breccia, then that clast is pretty large, a centimeter or so. if it's a - if it's a crystal- line rock, then it - it's a sort of a feldspar- looking type crystal. the other, when i turned it over, it had another one of those white specks that most of the breccias have around here, and that's when i switched. so it could be a combination, tony."
"ron, houston. if delta delta is more than 50 percent finished, then use charlie charlie."
it must be because we haven't made any waste water dumps.
that's affirmative. ot 05 21 42 c_ lioh change?
"and i'll do - obviously, cursor's first."
okay.
two more.
"jack, this is houston. you're clear with consider- able noise. over."
it seems like i always find myself upside-down in whatever i_m doing around here.
"okay; it's off, and, of course, it went gray again."
okay.
"okay. stand by for zero. b, _, 1 -"
...
that should do her. i think we've fixed it. *** the hoses in my storage box.
"okay. now i want to stick that beauty right up under there for now. okay. now, we're ready to get yours off. yours goes to the mid-step. 05 06 42 20 lmp-i_m can you pick up on it?"
"doesn't that lm look neat, sitting on the other side of that crater?"
"intrepid, houston. the folks down here say that was pretty nominal for apollo 11."
"okay. we're on the steerable, and i'm not going to touch it."
i'll tweak it.
roger. thank you.
"oh, i can get it. o0 00 23 24 irp here. i can just read it to you."
"okay, houston; aquarius."
"boy, charlie, it's - looks like we could just - smoky and stone mountain look like they're 10 feet away from us."
"hey, gordo, i've been looking at the landing site off and on the last few revs, and i'd like to get - now that we've been there and back - your best guess of the exact position of what you think we landed_ because i think i've got it pinpointed pretty much so from here."
okay.
okay. it is locked; it is on.

pulled it. okay.
"and, i make the same comment about yerkes. and i'm on beyond them now; i'm looking at proclus now. and - may as well comment on proclus while i'm here. remember yesterday, we were talking about variations in the crater wall to - that - well, don't exactly know how to describe it, but there - there is a tremendous variation in the wall, which does line up with ejecta pattern. if - there's almost a straight wall on the side of proclus that is minus an ejecta pattern. and then there is some break- - through directly in the middle of that - of that wall, which makes proclus looks like it's almost a circular crater. however, the - the truth is that proclus looks like a - a - an elongate crater with - with one wall steeping [sic] - dipping quite steeply into the crater. and that wall is oriented perpendicular to a line bisecting the excluded zone - dipping into the crater. and then right - right in the middle of that portion, it looks like there was a - a small - well, a small piece of that wall was - was also ejected, but it - it was only at the top part of that - of that fault scarp. and so, if you look at it from the right angle, you can see almost a flat plate, which looks like it's cut right into proclus, and to the - to the north and west of that flat plate is the crater proclus, and to the south and east is a small chunk out of the top of it that coincides with the - the - the cen- tral part of the excluded zone."

that mess them up?
"yes, as a matter of fact, messier a does show a secondary crater. and i have the impression that that was an old crater that kind of smoothed and darkened and looked like the rest of these older craters, and that it - messier a then was penetrated on top of that, or at least formed subsequent to that, and it kind of broke into that wall."

"you would really love this sight. we're - as we rotate around now, we've got the earth out the window number l, and it's about - oh, almost - not quite down to half. and you can see india and the continent, and it's covered with clouds, and no photograph can ever describe the way it looks. it's really super."

"yes, i will."
"and with a little excitation from the thum2dwheel, it took off again."
"great. so is yours. well, anyway, i got the b000- south call, which was a good call. and as we cm_e down prior to p64, i could see the rille to the south, and i couldn't see it up over the nose. and i got the distinct im - impression, as i looked at hadley delta, coming into p64, that we were going to be way long. and, i guess - you know, i've never shot one of these landings before, and i got fooled a little bit there. and at pitchover, we were def- initely quite a ways south, and i never saw index crater all the way down. i saw what i thought was salyut, and the one north of salyut, which i sort of picked as a landmark to zero in on. i gave about four clicks right and then about two more right, as i remember, to get us back up to the north. and be- cause we were south, i lost the - the four craters in a row that lead into index. but i believe the topo relief is somewhat exaggerated in that our - our maps and models show good shadow at index. and, as good a crater as that is from orbit it was very easy to pick up in orbit w i never did locate it on the descent during the visibility phase. but i - i was able to see earthlight, and that substantiated your call of being bo00 short. now, after i got over a - a roll to come back up north with the lpds, and salyut what i thought was salyut i redesignated short to bring us back to what looked like a reason- ably smooth area. and then i just picked out a spot in between the holes down here, and i - put it down. and i guess i - i sort of have to agree with you that we're probably somewhere around november. and - let me think a little bit and see if i can remember seeing something that looked like november."
"okay, at 190:15. next page. p52, option 3 -"
"no, start out right. at least you're narrow. got too far to go."
"oh, one thing you've got to be careful of up here is - when you go to look outside, you kind of have to watch it because you get your - you get too greedy and you get your nose up against the window. about one breath is all it takes, and it's all fogged over."
"yeah, but it's just a bunch of white frags, i believe."
"when you're at 5 psi, it's - *** did really train for this in the right way."
"oh, okay."
"well, it depends on your point of view."
"okay. t-start, 166:42:12, and t-stop is 47:10."

"well, the sooner you do it, the sooner you get to sleep, and we'll be very anxiously awaiting that."
"yes, one right after the other. okay, what's going on ... _ 04 11 48 11 cdr/i_mp go ahead. 04 11 48 13 _ okay, we'll get it - would have gotten it on our checklist, fred. we're not quite there yet."
"oh, good."
okay.
"11, houston. in order to improve the communi- cations a little bit here, we'd like to try to get you on the high-gain antenna. we're recom- mending a ditch angle of o, yaw 355 - i say again 355, the track switch to manual, and wide beam- wi dth. over."
"- - about 20 minutes. well, it looks like it's going pretty close to where we want to be anyhow."

"okay, we're coming up."

"dave and jim, the science input now is that we want to forget that large block entirely. we want a- as large a collection of smaller frags as you can get us, and you'll probably be working near the rover for those."

"okay, joe, i'm ready to copy the changes in the flight plan."

"okay. what do you have to do? take it loose, or just -"
"yes, that may be. what's this one right here? that one right beside it. oh, i don't know whether we're that far out or not, al."
it will be a g&n entry.
okay.
"and, bob. at least, there - there's no apparent relative motion between fragments."
i got the hose?

"got you. you're going to get a chance to get some pictures of that next - next rev. cml° next rev? okay, they ought to be good ones be- cause the sun angle is going to be pretty good. but, at this point, you get a dark tan, kind of a mare-type material - it's in mare-type materials. and then it's a light gray down in the d-caldera itself. sure looks like a ""d"" all right. but it's a light gray down in there. and then it's got bumps that stick up: and the bumps themselves are - i want to look at it again for sure. but i get the impression the bumps, themselves, are the light tan material."
"okay. cdr's to b; plss 02 pressure gage is read- ing 91 percent, and - how do you read me, jim? 06 18 53 42 l_ oz_,i read you loud and clear."
"okay, i'll give you a mark."
i'm looking at you. you - you ought to come over here and see the - command module.
"yes, f-stop's fine. i've got what looks like two ridges and then the horizon in the picture, and i see a - just past the second ridge - -"
... bags ...
"... wet pack, turkey and gravy."
this is the right one?
... roll.

"good readback, ken. and i'd like to ges a fiighz plan change _o you there at 98:45 in your fiigh_ plan."
"jack, did you put those gloves on?"
"okay, repeat. ""noun 78 is plus 270.00, minus 040.63. noun 79, minus 0.0830, plus 000.50. noun 34, plus 00.151, plus 0.0034, plus all zips."""

"and, america, the computer is yours again."
"six minutes, we should be at 32,000 *** - -"
getting cold?
"no. well, i did but i covered it."
"okay, we got signal strength."
"okay. out the window 4, i have an excellent view of kepler. once again, albedo differences, such as the - are very clear - such as the distinction between the wall - light - or brighter wall materials and the rim which, in itself, is brighter than the surrounding mare. we can look right down some of the rays, aud the rays are not completely linear. i'm looking now to the northwest. gene, you can see aristarchus way up there in the northwest. see it?"
gamma ray is going out.
"you don't mean the head crater, do you? let's get some of this mound al."
okay; there's t_k 2.
"all right, i'll get these propellants on."
"you can tell charlie's real adapted to zero gravity. a couple of days ago, he couldn't spin that pencil."
"houston, apollo 11."
(laughter) i don't plan to have that.
"okay. i'll - let me dig for them. gordo, on these boom deploy times and retract times, i don't have all of those times each time i do it, precisely, because sometimes it happens that i'm off busy doing something else, and i - you know, i miss the barber pole, so i - i don't have all of them."
roger.
"listen, we need to find a grapefruit, too, you know. 04 22 16 46 l_ yes. there's a bunch around."
okay; it's not biting - any more than usual.
what?
right there.
"that's good, jim. good deal."
"bob, - -"
"that's affirm. 04 08 58 32 cdr-l_ okay, ed - okay, ed. we'll give you a little quick s_mmary here before we get on with it. the general terrain looks exactly like what you had on 14. and many of the craters that we use for id were completely washed out with no shadows, and i - that's probably because the topo data - data just wasn't that good. and i think we're setting a little off in attitude, but we're in fairly good shape. and, when we get around to the seva, we'll try and pin down the location exactly. i had a little bit of dust at 150 and completely obscured at 50 feet. it was ifr from then on down. and the rest of it, you can probably see it as well as we could."
"what was the elevation setting, tony?"
...
... use one of those?
"i just wanted to try out that - mode contrable [sic] - control cable with the pcm stuff, you know?"
read you loud and clear. we had a fairly good night's sleep.
my hand!
"get it off? 01 12 56 _1 cmp yes, i ... turn this prd in. o1 12 56 _9 cdr get the prd out of there while you're at it."

"no. is_-eva oh, dadgummit. well - -"

"did you have anything else for me, hank?"
okay.
one or the other.
"it certainly comes out easier, doesn't it? i mean like you're going to have to - ... that way - that's right, because this place is fuller than the mock- up ever was."
"roger, joe. 02 01 56 33 i24p joe, do you read me now?"
"okay. pitch is about minus 20 degrees; yaw is 190; and the agc - i'll give it to you in clock code for 12 o'clock; it's about - about 45; in other words, i'd estimate about three-quarter full scale."
"roger, ron. just a reminder on the loi [sic] canister change - have you gotten into that?"
i know it. i know. i just didn't know if you were yet. what a machine. what a machine!
yes.
"okay, bag 340."
roger. i haven't been on all your revs. you ever had any - anything you'd call a visual on the i_?
i don't imagine we've come down more than 5 or 6 miles. 04 13 41 19 _ i'll look at it right now. the ags thinks we're 50.
it says we're there.
"yes, and it locked; just took some diddling. okay. sun's over there. oops, i forgot my boyd bolts. let's see."
04:30. a minute to go. i'll give you a mark at a minute on the time.
"boy, i tell you, when we look back, that's going to be quite a sight if we can see into that sun. we have been coming uphill. well, i'd say this is the - this is the last straw to the top. and is she workingx come on, baby. _p-eva okay. i think you bear -"
"yes, that's too bad."
"okay. 04 i1 08 12 cc i think i know how you feel, charlie° i'm pretty turned on myself. 0h 11 12 38 lmp-lm tony, how is casper doing?"

okay; standby on the nap camera.
okay. we agree. they're hustling.
"at 600 feet, we want 5, john."
"america, houston. we're ready for a spinup now. imp okay."
"houston, is there anything else you need on the burn status report?"
"(laughter) yes. clever you should think of that, ' joe."
"yes. aquarius, houston. go ahead."
"okay; got you. lmp: prd, 24064; 7-1/2 hours very good sleep, i hour intermittent. had a seconal. i took two aspirins yesterday. and since the last reporting, i've had four containers of water."
yes.

okay. we copy that.
it's off.
we're listening.
noun 18 is attitude. gimbal angles. there's time.
okay.
"it sure did, john. we're really impressed."
...
"okay, houston. it's - the hatch circuit breaker is in, and - couldn't be my headset at all, could it?"
that's right. on.
i got to go over - we'll - we'll - -
what's wrong?
"hello, gordo. this is geno. i'm - back on the line."
"i guess to answer your question, we're not really in a big crater anywhere. i - i think there are possibly - one gear may be in one of these small craters. and as you might have heard jim and i discussing, there's a rather high crater density and i guess my references to traffic - trafficability were really to boulders, because that's what i was really most concerned with on driving the ro - rover. there is a fairly high crater density around. and, as i mentioned, they range up to probably 10 - 8, 10 meters or so. and in our local area - let me give you a - a rough count of the, oh, 8- to 10-meter ones. i guess one every 15 to 20 meters. so there's a - a fair number of medium craters. nothing sharp, no boulders, and it may be that one footpad is in one of these craters that range on down to maybe 2 meters or 1 meter. and then there's a sharp break in craters down to probably a foot or so. but it - it's almost like 14, as i remember their pictures, quite a variety of crater sizes, up to some certain limits. i don't see anything on the 25-meter scale that we hoped to expose the bedrock in our immediate vicinity, although i can see some fresh ones - maybe some rims out through the window here at 10 or 11 o'clock. but i can't really account for our attitude right now. we'll just have to get out and take a look."
"*** not going to be able to get that one in the bag, i don't think. 5-154 _'[__ _''_'_'_ ' day7"
yeah. sorry. okay. i'm going to get a camera. you all set?
"yeah, i don't show any, and i've got you bore- sighted in att hold, and i don't show any motion there either, ken."
"roger. and i'll call this gamma ray, gainstep, shield, back on, al. we want to let it go for 10 minutes yet."
"america, we'd like h2 tanks - h2 tank i fans on, please."
"that landmark tracking worked out real easy, huh, richard?"
okay.
"eagle, looking great. you're go."
yes.
"oh, jiminy christmas! i can't even pick up that big bag to close the gate. i've got to - i've got to trip tht latch with - with tongs or something to lock it. 5-160 __ day7"
(laughter) it even looked like scorpio (laughter). oh.
okay. you're go.
"is that for a thermal reasons, hank?"
"loud and clear, ed."
right on!
- - challenger is go and coming through 14k.
that's right.
okay.
"orion, are you requesting burn time? over."
"yes, this is much better."
"and bob, i'm - i'm - i'm very firm of th_ now. i'm almost positive, unless i'm awfully mistakon about trident. i don't see how i could be from here. at the sacrifice of my cleanliness, houston, the basic bright-colored rock type in the area 1qoks very much like a cristobalite gabbros of the - i didn't see cristobalite, but it looks like the gabbros in the mare basalt sweep. the coarse- grained clinopyroxene plagioclase rocks."
"tsiolkovsky - yes. see, put this like this, where this points at the leb and then - - !"
"thatvs in the south polar regions. there's a - i think you can probably see a long chain of cra- ters, which so far unvisited by man_ in fact, the whole region has_ and that goes for the north pole."

"henry, did you copy that?"
"houston, apollo 11. i'd say that the secondary loop was actuated about 15 to 20 minutes ago. over."
"yeah, i know."
"i just can't reach it. 05 06 32 52 cdr-dm okay, it's off; 94.5 percent. houston, 94 and a half."
that's what you need to do.
"houston, aquarius."
"apollo 15, houston."
is it good?
"and, america, houston. the high gain angles to go with that roil angle of 306. high gain angles are pitch, 34; yaw, 267. over."
took -
"jack, we think that might have been a real one due to the accumulator cycle with the 02 makeup flow going on there - it gave - it held the 02 flow higher for - greater than 16 seconds."
that's no problem.

"yes, open ours."

"bob, just to keep you and the people there thinking a little bit, today is a relatively short day; but it is a good day because it gives us a chance to again get acclimated finish our stowage and just generally go through all the things that have to be gone through for the rest of the mission. we've got 3 eating days today, and judging from what we're thinking and talking about now - that the last two are going to he sort of stretched into one eating period because three meals on this particu- lar day just is not really going to be stomachable."
... all over the camera. i confidenti/w
"okay. we're going to have to pick another tube. how about right here, pete?"
"thisis one of the worst bags we've had - packing. it just doesn't stay down. probably - if we get time somewhere, we ought to change that out."
"like just small valleys that are trending upslope, joe. and - we go down low enough so that we can't see the lm anymore. won't see him until we get on top of the next rise. they're very gentle valleys. and they're about - would you say - 60, 70 meters across ?"
stand by.
"yes, you'd better. - i just didn't see that crater that i - that wasn't the one, dave."
"and now we're - there's - there's another ray we're coming in out of south ray, which definitely out of south ray, you can see it trending right on in to south ray."
okay. coming up ...
"good show, ron."
i'll tong it (laughter) if i can't do it the other way.
"aquarius, houston. when you look out a detent 2 in the proper burn attitude, what you ought to see is the sun at 12 o'clock, about halfway between the top of the aot and the center of the pipper. and you ought to see the earth - -"

"endeavour, requesting accept for your new state vector and a shaping target load."
"okay, bob."
i didn't get to it yet; i haven't taken it off.
okay.
...
"okaj, houston; we're going to be about 45 or a min- ute late. is that okay?"
"give you this monitor, dave."
say again.
"okay, jack, i'm going to turn these lights off."
"take your time, jack."
"apollo 16, houston. everything looks good down here. you've got a go for doi, and the monitoring limits in the flight plan are good."
"houston, apollo 11."
yes.
let me show it %o them.
"man, it really went, didn't it? manual attitude, three, min impulse."
"okay, tony. we're in a real blocky boulder field here. it's probably from - thrown out from spook. what we originally called spook was not spook. i think this blocky one is spook. and we're coming up from the south side of it."
"okay, bob, the bra is stowed."
"yes. i can cut, if you want to put water in them."
"stand by a minute, charlie. we're thinking about that."

"well, we'll sure give it a try. it's just not - perhaps once i just get the hand controller out of detent, that'll stop it at whatever new attitude i_ has, and that - that ought to hold it, so that there may be no further transients. i'll try that first."
"okay. guidance has got a little thing they're looking at and talking to people in the back room, little discussion going on here."
"yeah, i restarted it, then didn't mean to stop it, just kind of kept it going. is that attitude looking all right or - i don't have any way of reading out where the dead band is centered now. would you like for me to just stop and start all over again?"
... press on now.

"bob, you cut out about your systems test meter discussion."
"loud and clear. houston, intrepid. how do you read?"
"well, let me get a piece of this glass."

huh?
go ahead.
copy that.
okay. i said that the delta-v r that fred questioned computes well with the component - its rms.
"hey, that 's another bingo."
okay. don't stay up all night.
"and, jack, we'd like to go to india on the maga- zine for you. okay. magazine india. my goodness, we'll never get started. cdr-_fa man, we are down in a - look at where we came down, jack. and that was just one of the hills. got to go back up and then down some. hey, thank you for that fix on the fender, by the way, because i'd hate to see what it would look like without it."
"i just did something. oh, that - that's all right. 05 00 45 07 _mp-eva john, it sure looks like we're on a more than 2-degree landing slope, but it's not."

i'm going to go down this way.
"and now, i'll see if i can find rieeioli."

"i guess i'd have to say - sort of, two events occurred which were exciting for different reasons, and i guess they were really kind of the highlights of - of the flight for me. one was, right after loi, when we got our first look at the moon, and it was a fantastic, spectacular sight. and the other, i guess, was when tgi burned so beautifully, and right after tei, that was an awfully good feeling."
copy that.
can't guess.

those are my tongs. do you want me to bring the other tongs?
"yes, i think so. i can't get any. 05 12 42 53 i2{p okay. come on, give me your hand."

"yeah, mine, too."

okay. i'm gonna roll left.
...
roger.
"challenger, we want to get the - attitude - -"
"okay. and, also, on station 9, it may turn out to be difficult to find a pristine area. we'll let you scout around a little bit, and pick your own station 9 of whatever looks like isn't ray mate- rial. and on the location of station 10, we'd like you to put it just about where you said it might go as you were driving back yesterday. it sounds like the contact between the ray and the non-ray material is just west of you there, and we'd like to run the penetrometer array along the contact but in the ray material; that is, the penetrometer array would now go in a northeast/ southwest direction, and a double core would be something like 50 meters to the southwest of the deep core. let me correct that a second here. hold on. i'll correct that. the double core will be about 50 meters towards the lm but along the contact, so it'll be about 50 meters closer to the lm than the deep drill. and at station 10, since you'll have a longer sampling time, we'd like you to sample on both sides of the - of the - of the t- ray; in other words, in the ray, along the line between the deep drill core and the lm, and off the ray to the west. 05 19 38 hl cdr-lm okay, houston. i'm going to have to hold the uv c_w_ra back. i think ..."
okay. i guess we're changing our mind. we would like to put it in the shade.
that's correct.
charlie.
"houston, apollo 16; over."
- - and they're closer to lara.
"i have a suggestion ... that last one. i'll bet if you could ... you could use it a little bit in the simulator. final comp, dick, on the last midcourse."
"roger, thank you."
"shit, i think that's alaska out there. that would be right, wouldn't it?"
"okay; thank you. 0h 00 34 44 cdr houston, 15. we're equalizing pressure now, and the delta-p was 1.0 before we started."
roger.
okay. and the material is ...
"it's reading about three-quarters, yes."
and the ion source is on.
"okay, bob. we'll - we're doing our best. *** rtv worked on the hammer, but look at it, jack. *** worn completely to a nub. it's off."
looks like it's going to shut down 2 seconds late.
...
okay; we'll torque them at 1130.
affirmative.
roger.
"roger, i've got some information about your mid- course 5, which is scheduled to come up here. we have a firm decision that there will not be a mid- course 5 maneuver required, and the numbers behind that are a g-mrna of minus 6.69; your vacuum perigee is 18.4, and the midcourse 5 correction that we're showing now would be 3/10ths of a foot per second. the corresponding midcourse 7 correction runs at about 1.8 feet per second. and, based on that new information, we're wondering if you're still inter- ested in doing the uv photography at its scheduled time or waiting until after the - the eva. and we're also wondering what your choice will be on the solar corona photography. over."
"and some more information, if you'd like to copy it; i have sunset at 102:35:50 and _erform 400 plus 3 aider the p52. ar.d for the p52 use _he s_me stars as the p52 in the timeline book. __.a_ of course, after the up-links to you - i_ep_ =7_ over. 04 06 05 24 lm_-ijm roger. we copy all of that. one thing - you want us to do option 3 before the option 17"
"roger. understand. there'll soon be a co_n switch over to madrid here shortly. we may break ... in just a few minutes here. or a few seconds, rather."
four - about 04:15.
we'll put it in our activation book. let me find the right page.
we - we agree almost exactly with the ground.
"well, let me get down. okay? 06 00 18 33 iaip-eva got it."
"okay. now, - -"
it bumps against this ... - -
yes. we have ... 08 0_ 09 _6 cdr we haven't ...
have to check that just a second.
"okay, houston; endeavour. looks like we must have just run across a little funny there, karl, be- cause it started okay now and is running."

"hey. number 1, coming out. 02 19 09 06 imp okay. got her down."
"15, this is houston. we're showing a low voltage on the battery relay bus down here. we think it's just a matter of instrumentation, but there's a couple of procedures we'd like to run through here to check it out."

"okay, casper. this is houston. you might pick up a temperature caution light on your quads, but it's no consequence."
"0rion, will you confirm forward omi?"
"roger, ken. we'd like to do the p52, and since the problem's cleared up, i imagine you can use the verb 49 maneuver."
"okay. we'd like you to just start out with the left front and the right front drive powers on bus c. if the battery 2 isn't working, you shouldn't go anywhere."
"3 1/2 down s 220 feet, 13 forward. (eagle)"
"yes. sure do. stand by 1. w_'d like b[omei), left, please."

that's already auto.

go ahead.
"oops, try that again. okay, why don't you hand me the neutron flux, and i'll put it - -"
"no, you don't need to. you pull it out - just pull the thing out and stuff it in there and it'll be fine."
what's the matter?
305 is plus 00594.
"and it looks like you ought to be getting in your p52 when you get a chance here. cml° yes, i'll get her down here. (humming) can't tell about these geologists. they put on extra maps in your spacecraft and things like that, you know. yes, i get - i gaveyou the last frame number on that romeo romeo, but i think i forgot to tell you the one after the - the other one. oh, by the way, on the other one, agassiz was com- pletely in the darkness and there was no crater rim at all to shine down on agassiz so we didn't get him at all."
"roger. at 202:30, it's discriminator, low, in that line on the mass spec."

are you through with the gnomon?
"okay; and when you're ready, you can give me call, when you're ready for some updates, particularly concerning eva planning, and i'll have a few good words to pass you then, when you're con - when it's convenient."

no. i said that's all they need.
"well, let me give you a hand. we need any a - we don't need any -"
"okay; got another little thing here in the local paper you might be interested in. houston paper reports that the city is moving to annex a 50- square-mile area west of houston, including the federally-owned addicks and barker reservoirs and the land between them and the present city limits. the annexation reportedly would open the way for the city to develop the reservoir areas for rec- reational purposes. and i guess that does not - the annexation would not include about 4 square miles of barker reservoir in fort bend county, which is outside the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction. and three u.s. representatives have studied a feasibility study of deepwater ports in the gulf of mexico and have reconnnended the texas coast as a possible site. texas repre- sentatives jack brooks of beaumont, bob eekhardt of houston, and john young of corpus christi appeared here monday at a u.s. corps of engineer public hearing to voice their opinions on such a f_ facility."

"endeavour, we'd like to have omni alfa."
yeah? okay ... get the ... on this here.
we're at 184/2.3. we're just about between henry · and - locke. yes; right between them.
"stu, i - i just thought you'd like to be aware of it, as much time as we've all spent down at the cape, probably may is one of the nicest months down there. however, having had the opportunity to - to be up here during may, i find out that it's not nearly as nice up here."
"now, you're good. .confidentrai"
"well, you verified all this, didn't you, gene?"
okay. the earth went through at 26 degrees going the opposite direction this time - left to right. is that right?
"oh, you got it?"
yes.
"...? okay, read on."
"okay, we'z'e _itching up the radar track attitude. we dian't get a tockon on the waif u_. we'll give you a call as soon as we get locked up."
"okay, henry, he'll - thank you."
this is the last dump anyway.
"yes, you really want to set the ordeal up on verb 83."
watch your water.
okay.
go ahead.
awfully frustrating.
okay. t-stop isn't it - -
i know where. i'll get there.
- - and that's two-jet ullage - -
get the water?
"okay, the ems is minus 50 - - 08 23 52 11 i$_p it's starting to come in now. 08 23 52 l2 c_sp it's agreeing well. past 200. it should be leveling it off, and it is."
"okay, that's what we're going - -"
the documented sample bag.
you'd have to adapt it.
"say again, charlie."
"and, orion - -"
"okay, houston. magazine double dog and double easy going on the _t. 0h 19 29 30 lmp *** handle."
roger. we copy.
"affirmative. also at 247:36 is ""add the uv photos,'! and we've already sent up the changes required for that; the changes over and above what's on page 3-352. and there's one reminder there, and that is to verify that when you use filter 2, that you take one frame for 20 seconds and one frame for 2 seconds. l0 06 00 31 imp roger. we remember that."
yes.
oh. stand by on that one.
"okay, bob. when i finished with south massif, i was on 94 and i took - now i'm on 99 - i took five more pictures back over to the northeast."
"roger, mike. you w_lt to tweak the 02 flow up just a bit there?"
okay. let's go to depress.
"roger, houston. we got that. thank you. (eagle)"
"okay, the valve's all the way open. and i'm 3.5."
"let me go take a look at that. wait. oh, gosh, let's get dressed up here first."
"okay. i think i've got my orb rate ball set up where we can check it again in another minute. age50 (ionfiden tank pressures are reading 40. we're out of co_n with them now, are we? 00 02 23 54 lm_ yes."
... up.
roger.
"good morning up there. say, i think we may have driven your high gain into the stops. could you check on 225 the high gain flight bus and group 2? if one's out, push it in."
okay. atca (pgns) to close.
"odyssey, houston. over."
"the met is parked in the sun, _l_5-degreeang!e_ s-band cover is on it. it looks like it's going to spend the night very comfortably."
"houston, apollo 11. go ahead."
"okay, let me mark off what i did here. okay, before lift-off, we'll end up with - making sure that the cmc has control of the optics; we'll fly with the cmc to the initial attitude_ then we'll go to scs control; bmags, three, att i/rate 2; max, dead band; limit cycle, on; and rate, low. then we'll do our initial tracking there. and we'll stay with that and 172:10 when the normal auto maneuvers would be enabled, i - i'll probably take the pitch bmag to rates and start a small rate in there."
"that's right: 57 and 20.5. onfiden,i' l"
"later on in the day, we're gonna do some of these gainsteps, but we'll call them real time."
"yes. plss pump, off; plss fan, off. disconnect plss water from pga; connect i_ water. 05 06 23 05 lm_-lm that's a good idea."
he didn't mean to do it. 0k 0k 22 17 hmp he didn't?
"jim, regarding the start time for the powerup, you mentioned an hour and 15 minutes. we think that is adequate. this is crew preference de- pending on how much time you think you need. we would go along with an hour and 15 minutes - -"
"houston, now have noun 93; are you happy?"
- - your thinking eorrebpond_ to ours. and you'll be wanting to head more towards the south - towards - the numbers 334 and 3.3 clicks.
*** both suit isolation valves to suit discon- (rm_q ) _ct.
"yes, i can do that, but i think the pictures will be better, vance, because the cinder cones are much smaller than the definition in the picture. i i"
"we want to transfer some power - i want to go to high bit rate here first, then want to transfer lm power to csm, fred."
come on back here a minute.
"16, houston. we're noticing that the glycol evap out temp is coming on down, and we need to adjust that mixing valve in. but rather than crawling under there and doing that right now, what we want to do is get you to take the temp in switch from manual up to auto, and we'll give you a call when to put it back in manual and see if that will cut it."
"okay, dave. this involves delaying the sim bay turnoff until 238 hours and 30 minutes. and in detail, at 238 plus 05, delete the p30 external delta-v, and the verb 49 m,aeuver. lines: at 238 plus 20, delete sextant star check; at 238 _ plus 28, delete all the steps from there starting with circuit breaker scs, et cetera, up to 238 plus 55, ending with rhc power direct (2) - off, et cetera. over."
oks_. i'll put the knobs there.
"no, i haven't, but i'll w - i'll work it later."
"yes, sir."
"not quite,"
need you to get this hinge pin over here. 05 00 21 23 ia_p-eva okay.
"wait, wait."
"okay. nav circuit breaker is open. oop, forgot the tv."
"not eon's, we found ours."
"go ahead, gordo."
roger. copy.
yes.
"okay, let me pull awhile. you ready to go?"
max.
roger. 03 05 38 3_ lmp jacks why don't you get the other .._
"understand. 07 08 02 40 _ ed, can you get for - the p30 load here for me as i go through it?"
stand it up because the cover won't hack it.
"okay, no transmissions here."
get another one?
there's cone crater. 04 12 11 16 la_p right on the money.
*** we changed it to a subfloor instead of a *** unit.
"step 3, scratch ""trac_[ mode to auto."" 07 23 32 10 i_m_1 okay."
"hey, houston, will you look at your solar panel?"
okay.
vi is i at 35589.
"i think, tony, my view is the same. we had only a predominance of south ray ejecta all around. mostly some of the smaller rays were given to descartes. it just occurred to me that everywhere we were, there was a boulder field of varying sizes _nd intensity and you could see eruptive force - you could look back at south ray and you could see the rays coming our way and spreading and fanning out as they flow."
"and, 15, we'd like to back out of your pyro arm situation right now."
"okay; i assume this line in here, ""stop pitch rate at 146 degrees,"" means stop at 146 degrees in pitch. is that correct?"
"okay. here goes delta-v a now. okay. a is up in on, and the sps thrust light is off."
okay. that's what i thought.
wait a minute. let me get un - unraveled a little bit - -
"apollo 15, houston. over."
"yes. okay, here's a piece of it. ail right?"
oh.
got the bag?
yes. l0i 2 started rev 3.
you have 10 percent waste water now. you can terminate the dump.
"looks good, charlie; and, in regards to the photos, the pi says the sun will be very close to the moon, but that it shouldn't be in the field of view of the camera. the settings are good."
mark.
okay.
"odyssey, houston. you can go to up tel block. over,"
"no. you can see them in the sextant real well, ken. you just can't see them in the telescope."
"okay, vance. you're right. we do have cameras almost configured like you said. for the command module, you think that the el with the 250 lens, cex film, f:8 at a 250th is the best bet, and you're saying now that where you think you'll see it is out window 5? is that it?"
"hello, houston; orion. how do you read?"
okay.
"hello, apollo 11. houston. mike, there's no wait required. where rates are steady, you can proceed on. over."
should be mag r.
go ahead.
"don't worry about it, charlie. 06 03 27 39 i24p-eva well, i was gonna put it in a sack so they'll make sure - all that hammering, i don't want them to lose it. yeah."
"okay. well, we're moving in that direction, partly to get the cabin cooled down. and we'll probably talk to you in the morning, before very long."
"rate, high."
don't let any dust get in your eyes; there's a lot floating around here.
"we got a rcs problem, but it's not too bad. other- wise, we're okay. we can't get our steerable antenna up."
"that's affirmative, jim. that's the one we gave you last night after the big burn, and we'll use that one as modified by - by us. this - we tried this ptc under ags in the simulator and, of course, no slosh or amything, but it seemed to work pretty good by hulling the rates using the ttca in pitch a_ldroll and letting the acs do it in yaw. you null the rates by looking at the error needles and just watching those, and when they don't - when they stop moving, then you got it within the limits of what we want. over. oh 04 45 40 cd_ okay. a_d i gues_j, charl_e, you have no - do you have a att hold mode in pitch and roll at all in this configuration we're in, or do we have to use the ttca?"
good show.
"pete, the dimension on halo crater is about 20 feet, so that would make it half of what you saw at sharp."
"okay. tell me what that technique is to get the lamp on, in case i don't see it."
get open my ... my star ...
okay. then hold off on that; don't go ahead.
"in 9 minutes, we'll be right at 51."
okay. you want to swap seats to get in .....
okay.
okay. i have got the cameras on at one frame a second. c4 13 37 44 cdr okay.
"okay; you gave us a flight plan update for 226, and our clocks now say 227 - -"
"okay, houston, time zoro -"
roger. copy.
"okay, gordo. understand."
and mine are configured. 05 22 07 09 t_mp-lm okay.
did she build back up?
"still with you. _mp-lm say again, ron. okay, i'll have to give you another one here in a minute."
auto.
"#** give them. houston, cdr is reading - 90 - 91 percent."
"i am not happy here, al. i'm afraid something ... one these boyd bolts is not undone, and i don't understand why. 04 21 29 55 l_ why, one of them didn't do or what?"
"they've just lost lock, ron. (columbia )"
"roger. gamma ray gain step, one step up, now."
"finally found one, huh?"
"roger, al. we copy that. are you able to find any chips from that rock in the near vicinity?"
as i look up wessex cleft from just about abeam of it - let me get over here - it still shows me an albedo change and a surface wrinkle-texture change.
"okay; we're getting a good signal on you, and i guess that information makes everybody happy down here. thank you. l0 23 29 55 _ okay."
"right on, jim. just don't drive too far west."
"oh. well, you've got to eat one."
58 minutes.
how's your suit pressure? is it stable?
"okay, copy that. on the way back to station l, you described a small crater with light material on the bottom_ can you say anything more about that crater? lmp-i_ bob, i don't remember saying that, or gene doesn't either o"
"back in there somewhere. get out a couple for me, would you?"
yeah.
closed.
"yes, i've got to come out here. forget it."
"i got day 5, meal b."
okay.
go ahead.
okay?
"roger, that sounds interesting."
"okay, very good."
"... 00 05 h5 ho lmp i'm sorry - det, res_-_f."
"- - the other way, downslope with it, john."
no. take it; doesn't make any difference.
i'll pull the met. go ahead. age tconfidenti
"okay, john; when it comes back to direct, - -"
(laughter)
roger.
engine off ....
"mark. and it was at the left eye; 8 o'clock, and it was a streak, and it seemed to be moving from 8 o'clock to maybe the i o'clock position, about --- - it covered about 20 degrees of arc out to a position - periphery at 8 o'clock into midway on our sphere of reference. an intensity of 3. and -"
okay. my bag. top's not closed.
"houston, this is america."
"roger. we see them, fred, and i'm reading you loud and clear. 02 10 00 39 l_ okay. didn't think i'd be back this soon."
"okay. on 35, magazine zulu zulu, i'm reading 22 frames. i had to retake one of the frames; i knocked nryflashlight, and it came on while i was in the middle of one of the sequences."
"just, fine. waiting for you guys to go to sleep so we can do the same. had a great da_ up there, guys. cdr-ir oh, you don't have to wait for that. we're - it was super from here - it's quite an experience, deke, and quite a chal1enge."
"okay. wait a minute. i can't even reach it. cml° okay, eva 02 is off."
yeah. they're good. want a bite?
i've eaten worse food in the last 3 days than i've eaten in my ... 03 13 12 h9 cdr got to start watching this baby here - see what happens.
i probably can if i'm careful; but i keep dropping them.
huh?
okay.
the large gray one to your right with large vesicles in it.
those parting plar_es go over the - go through the whole boulder on the order of at least 3 meters long and outcrop.
shutdown.
"yeah, it's got a lot of - it's fine grained - it seems to be a fine-grained crystalline rock any- way, the part that we can see. the particles in it are millimeter size, though. i see some millimeter-size sparklies flashing at me. that's going in bag 403."
"bob, i'm not doing too badly on keeping things clean. the - the base of the central station and - got some stuff on it_ but - otherwise it's pretty good."
main a/main b.
say again. 09 05 43 55 imp okay.
i'm going to go over and start getting out of my suit then.
"logic, off."
"okay, understand hold for instructions from msfn. is that before the power, on?"
it is?
a_ldhave you got a - los time for us?
yep.
"pretty exciting, isn't it? ... me another shot of water, charlie."
... be another ... difficult.
calling up 42.
"do you see me, bob?"
okay. it is locked.
roger. we understand that. say again the angles now; let's check them.
it's off.
"okay, you're on suit disconnect? yes."
no. go get the vise - i mean the drill. i think we're about through with this.
could you explain the circumstances surrounding the failure of the lunar module ascent stage to deorbit?
"hey, i'm going to get the - -"
"roger. and if you guys will give us lhe compu%er, we'll send those updates to you."
"eagle, houston. on our load - during our load, we had to do a verb 96 to stop integration. we're going to start over again on this load. over."
"bob, you said 185/1.57 l_2°-eva what do you want7"
okay. gimbal motors number 1.
roger.
roger.
"stand by, gene."
"as i look around the area, the contrast, in general, is *** comes about completely by virtue of the shadow *** down sun ... very light-colored gray, light gray color, a halo around my own sha- dow, around the shadow of my helmet. then, as i look off across *** the contrast becomes strongest in that the surromlding color is still fairly light. as you look down into the sun *** a larger amount of *** shadowed area is looking toward us. the general color of the *** surrounding *** the contrast is not as great. surveying all the dusty area that we've kicked up *** considerably darker in texture. now, i've kicked up one, _ld i ima- gine that this is *** surveyor. the same is true when i survey across on - along the area that we're walking, in general *** to the fact that there are footprints there. general terrain where i've been kicking up a lot of this surface material is generally of a darker contrast *.**color_ 04 ih 31 29 !2_p the panorama i'll be taking is about 30 or 40 feet out to plus ***"
"delta-vx, noun 86, is plus 0102.6."
"it's done. rotation control power, direct, and auto ..., off."
mark; 3. the - vi is good.
"hey, a1 .... ?"
"and the hard part is over, once you acquire them at that low elevation. in fact, the elevation is as difficult as - any sort of sun problem. that wculd be here, as we go - go towards the zero- phase; i guess it's probably still about 08:h0 and i'd guess about 40 minutes to go. it's still hanging in there right now. no - no problem at all. particularly b, it's - it hasn't the - the bright surface on the center across the crater - tkat makes it that much easier. let's see, i can see the zero-phase. and i guess the camera was pointing at it as we get up here closer. and i es_ see zero-phase now, approaching target a, so tkis should be a - a good test. been no problem to acquire up to now. 04 16 04 39 cml_ there's zero-phase just about on a, and the camera took the picture. okay, we went through zero- pkase on a with - with no problem - hanging on to tile landmark itself."
"aquarius, houston."
"jim, if you can get the sesc in there that would be great, and then go ahead and close out that rock box."
this is the best friday afternoon matinee i've ever been to.
it does_ that's a fantastic thing to show somebody.
"apollo 11, houston. roger. on your g])calign pitch, it should be 233, 233 in the pitch. over."
"roger, jim. copy."
ems and the delta-v to go are right together. perfect.
"okay. i'll yell to j_m, and jim will give you a call."
"roger, al. recommendation from the ground here. they'd like to see - maybe as many as five optics calibration marks the next time, instead of the two. it's just to give them some data."
st:u?
"i'm just going to do the p50 there with that magazine, i got to come up with another magazine, and - -"
"roger that. and also if you can go to p00 and accept conveniently, we'd like to uplink."
roger; copy. and that was both - -
that's affirmative.
"okay. your plss is - looks like it is clearing okay. your toes are about to come ov_,rthe sill. okay. now drop your plss down. there you go; you're clear. and laterally you're good. you've got an inch clearaz_ce on top of yomr plss."
"and, could you give us an amp reading while you're driving?"
"that would be a good place to look for it from, charlie, right up here."
"i don't know. i think that's how it is. that bleed flow means leaving the - the hose in the port and leave it on, right?"
"okay. we're in the inner wall of the depression here, and the rocks still look like subfloor gabbro. boy, there's certainly not much variety."
"okay. tone on, vent flag p, press flag 0, 02 momentary."
"try it somewhere. okay, are you happy with the alignment?"
off.
mark.
"boy, conrad, if that turns out, it's going to be so spectacular. don't let me get behind a power curve here."
"okay. 17, we're ready for you guys to move on and we'd like to eliminate the rover sample at hole-in-the-wall."
"dave - if there's any chance you can see the shadow? the antenna is moving, is it not?"
"okay, houston. understand. entry pad, mid-pac; 000, 153, 000; 294:41:37, 267; plus 26.12, minus _ 158.10; 06.2; 36097, 6.50; 1084.8, 36179; 29_:58:37; 00:29; 4.00, 02:13; 00:18, 03:38. 07:44% 04, 140.3, 37.5; 213, down, 09.6, right, 4.7; lift vector, up. comments: nonex - use nonexit ems pattern; ret 90 k is 6 plus 06; ret mains, 8 plus 32; ret landing, 13 plus 29; constant g is roll right, moonset at 294:56:20."
"roger, al; we understand."
"apollo 16, if you can get to it, we'd like to terminate the bat a charge."
"lb, houston. we'd like you to additionally bring on the fans in 02 tank l, and we can stand the additional amperage on that."
there.
"well, let me just say one thing, hank, and that is - mr. descartes said it. he said, ""there's nothing so far removed from us as to be beyond olzr reach_ or so hidden that we cannot discover it."" and you all know that descartes was the french mathe- matician and philosopher for whom the region was named. and i guess, really, the story of our mission so far is we've been out testing his theory. my personal s_sessment of where we are right now, as soon as we get the rocks back in the lrl, we'll be making headway toward proving he was right."
go ahead.
roger.
no. i'll have to wait until you turn around.
so am i.
"roger, neil. 04 13 19 36 l_2- okay. stand by, neil_ (trm_q)"
"15, this is houston. we'd like to have you go wide beam on the high gain antenna and then to narrow."
"well, karl, does your telemetry tell you it's on or off now?"
"cb ecs transducer, t_{perature, main a and main b, closed."
(sound of train)
okay. thank you much.
"it looks funny, because you - does look like you're horizontal, doesn't it? there's capella."
"hello, apollo ll. houston. would y?u please give us po0 and accept? we've got a clock up- date for you. 06 16 01 lb cmp go ahead, charlie. we're p00 and accept."
about 20 seconds to level sense arm.
"okay. i'll read these out as i go through them. and the only thing that looked a little different is when i got down to the step where it said pan camera mode to standby, it already was. i guess that's just an oversight. john, would you switch - why don't you put me on vox?"
"and, a1 and ed, for your stop for the e, we'd like that - take an estimated one-crater diameter short of the crater - north crater,"
"did you get this ... on, jim?"
"and, john, you might try to keep a hold of the sample bags for when you go out and park the rover. we may have you pick up a rock and put it on the lpm."
that sounds good.
wipe it with my - -

on the way back we'll get that.
... control ... freezing your ass off.
"okay, charlie. thank you."
"well, good evening, vance."
"okay, now, you want to put that thing down; let me review the - no, the - the time line instead of the docking procedures again? 05 23 20 33 _ okay."
"okay. third row, open up the next five - correction - open up the first five on the left, close aot heater, close sig conditioner 1. close attitude direct, and open the rest on row three."
okay.
"i guess - well, okay."
"roger, jim. we're ahead of ourselves there."
"sure wish you'd hurry up and get that trash ol,t out of there, though."
"yes, it is pretty nice. not bad at all. you're right; you didn't say it. this ptc we're in is a pretty - pretty nice merry-go-round, vance. every l0 minutes alternately i get to look at the earth and the moon."
"i'll take the lpm readings. okay, 161, 711, 117; 160, 711, 120; 160, 712, 117."
"okay. these are circuit breakers, rotation control power, direct, 1 and 2, main a and main b, closed."

"i tell you, i hate to see that thing ... 0h 05 33 16 cdr i really do get annoyed at those end pieces though; they just drive me absolutely ape! now, for your next one, did you want to shake the bag? look at that. is that a drop of water on the end of that bastard?"
mark. (columbia)
charlie?
that big - that big rock right there is a breccia - look at all those clasts in there.
okay ....
and the biomode - med data looks good now.
roger.
"i told you, he was a good geologist, one of the experts on the soils of london. not to mention their relationship to all kinds and brands of tobacco."
has the attitude changed?
"(laughter) oh, you think you're so clever. be- lieve it or not, bob, i'm anchoring the geophone module."
roger. that's the one you marked on. right?
"that one will go. try it now. that's all that's in there? 07 03 41 32 i_mp-lm baby rocks. well, let's call it _0, and see what they say. they'll let us go with that, i'll bet you. buddy slss bag is 40. bag 7 here."
yes; indeed it does. evidenced by the fact that you dug your front landing gear into a hole.
"orion, this is houston. how do you read?"
"15, houston. we see indications that the optics - aren't zeroed, and we'd recommend that you zero them, with the reminder, of course, to bring the angles down to l0 degrees - less than l0 degrees before you zero them."
good idea. 03 il 32 51 cmp i'm in reacq and narrow now. 03 !l 32 54 cc roger.
roger. (columbia)
okay. we're standing by for rrt. 08 23 k6 53 cmp and our thanks to the aria troops for the memento they sent before launch.
"no leave them on. you're only - you're only 3 or 4 minutes late. i24p yes. they wanted it earlier, though."
what the hell they got cotton inside for? 08 01 54 58 _ ... trying to do it in zero g is _shit.

"okay. understand. m_ only question, joe, is the fact that both the roll and the yaw needles did not go to null when i did an auto maneuver. i'd tried to go manually to the attitude; s_ldthen went to auto, but the roll and the yaw do not come in at all. 05 ]7 11 14 cc roger. i haven't got an answer on that yet, but your attitude looks ve_7 close."
low.
okay.
that's affirmative.
okay; we're maneuvering to vhf test attitude.
"okay, houston; america. here's n_ medical log."
okay. 0h 13 00 08 i}_.p [ feel good. i'm feeling better. you ought to get your hand in the game once.
good enough.
"that's good, john. it's about a kilo."
i'm - i'm in.
"look, you get up on the hill, and i'll get in the hole."
"yes sir, that's affirmative. and, i guess - we're still waiting for an isa weight. other than that, we're doing real fine. _ 08 07 18 47 cmp okay, joe."
"and, endeavour, this is houston with the maneuver pad when you're ready to copy."
do you read? over. okay. going to switch 1.
"question number 14. it seemed this flight had as many problems as some of the old gemini missions. which of these gave you the most concern; and, for dave, did you ever feel you were back on gemini viii?"
...
amazing.
"if i had to guess, i'd -"
"incidentally, you have about 123 pounds of rocks, which means you can get about another 100 pounds. 06 20 39 00 cdr-_ we do, huh? (no coremfor 21 minutes) 06 21 00 24 lnp-lm houston, how do you read? over."
"apollo 15, houston. over."
"att/translation, 4 jets?"
yes.
"i guess that's uprange, depending on how you look at it, gene."
you don't have another bag we can put this - this trash in?
"okay; maybe we better just leave it there. lma°-eva well, i'm making it worse by getting dust on the top."
i - stumbled over that rock. okay. ease that up for me?
"okay, jim. how do you read now?"
okay.
"the one we don't want is the next one around the cable. 05 02 15 i6 cdr-eva yeah, okay. i remember now. 05 02 15 20 i_mp-eva wait a minute, john."
"just a quick note on the - on the circuit breaker on the illumination, and then a procedure that might clarify a couple of things for us. first of all, there's a - a number of numeric and f electroluminescent lights that are out, but we won't go into all of that. the main thing is the panel 122 dsky down there. the - as far as we can see at the moment, there is some possibility that we still have illumination on your status lights on that dsky, and if we could go through a small procedure here, we may find out whether or not there will be illumination on this. stand by."
"okay. 06 o0 06 4h cmp hey, al. 06 00 06 45 cdr/lmp yes. 06 00 06 47 cm2p ... remember where you put thezl? i don't believe i've seen them."
all right. the burn was nominal.
okay. let me get ahold of this ... right now.
"stand by. i don't think we're interested in a sur- face sample in the last top little bit ring, it's just a - in the top - just a surface sample. stand byl."
okay.
"okay, verify the eva cbs. 06 06 04 02 cdr-ii._ yep. 06 06 02 03 ]__v_-l_.,! i got suit fan 2 and suit f_ delta-p going in."
yes. it's going to take us a while to work down- slope.
"okay. ***, jack. here. all right?"
okay. now it's yours.
aquarius. roger.
that's what i did right then.
...
"maybe it's fifty-four. f 05 03 35 08 cdr-eva yes, it could be."
okay. bus tie ac on.
"it should be out - out of here or there, either one. this seems to be fine."
"okay. and the last - last - the next thing is to stow the checklists. okay, do you have a suit circuit integrity check on there? i don't think you do on the cue card. it's on the panel."
- - and broke into the side of the bedrock that's been sticking out into this ... - -
move that handle and throw it away. 05 1_ 03 55 imp okay. that's a good idea.
"here. maybe i can reach it, jim. let me try it, jim .... - -"
i'll get it later.
go ahead.
"okay, houston; 17. i've started the secondary glycol pump, and it - i neglected to make a check on the evap op temperature. do you have that, and did we get a decrease?"
okay.
"and, jack, there - -"
roger.
you're l0 seconds'from t-start.
stand by 1.
"houston, 16. our lm/cm delta-p is 0.2 and the pressure equalization valve is open. our cryo systems are configured."
okay. we've got two - two barber poles.
"i'm glad to hear that. lmp-_ that was no surprise, bob. we wouldn't have taken it if it wasn't going to work."
"whoa, whoa. i'm not sure what's wrong. why don't you go left there?"
standing by for your mark.
okay. same - 1/60th? f
okay. go ahead. 06 07 26 b0 cmp okay. pan camera photo pad for your 151:50 in the flight plan. 06 07 26 h2 cmp go ahead. 06 07 26 lb cc okay. it's 151:57:1_ for t-start. t-stop is 151:58:27. over.
"eagle, houston. stand by. we'll check it. and, eagle, houston. can you give u:_a burn report ? (goss net 1) tape 81/2 (_'_ i_'_ )!j oi lu_j' f_,og_:r. [jt_j.nd by. (i,:/_,_,j;,_:) o_ 05 _9 24 l_ _ okay. the csi burn was on scheduled time of (eagle) 125 19 3470, 51.5 feet per second was our solution. after chasing residuals a little bit, we ended up with a minus 0.2, plus 0.7, and minus 0.1. and in the ags, at that time, we had plus 0.4, plus 0.9, and plus 0.3."
"it's - it's ei minus 2-1/2 hours, fred."
- - good plss data for both of you.
"it looks good from here now, ken. i !0408 14 54 cmp okay."
okay. ail my white dots shcw_ zeca!s?
"they'll tell me not to forget to turn the - i guess i am - - 07 22 18 27 ia_p ... you'd think they'd accept the flight plan ... and i checked the master arm, off, ... checked the master arm, off, verify. (laughter)"
two minutes?
"rut the dog did nothing in the nighttime, joe."
"these switches are on off, standby, right?"
okay - -
"112 and 40. you want to do a reset after we get to that target, right?"
"roger. we copy. copied the lm as plus 294.65, plus 289.96, plus 355.02. over."
low bit rate looks good.
level ground is great.
"okay, jack is the high gain away from my antenna. can you see?"
21129.
in the rain.
"apollo 13, houston. over."
yeah. there we are. secs pyro arm really is a sort of a ... for docking ...
roger. we copied the time and - -
"roger, neil. yaw o, pitch minus 20, high-gain angles. over."
be interesting to see what happens to the rover's speed here as we start upslope.
"okay, 200 feet, john? pag3e58 sa8y"
"houston, apollo 11. on this star, the auto maneuver works just fine. i am right at the substellar point. everything looks beautiful except there is no star in sight. it is just not visible."
got magazine able.
okay.
"all right, sir; you're on."
co_n connectors - -
we sure appreciate that. because i sure haven't. 03 2] 34 27 cc say again.
roger.
three quarters full.
"okay; how about telling us where we're going here, because - -"
"go ahead, bob."
but i said - you didn't hear me say it?
there's some - color charts.
"okay, i'll crank in these. get that gdc set up. 007.5 ··."
"see you in the morning, babe."
stick the purse in here.
also for l0 seconds thereafter.
and out to the side - there you go.
houston. casper. over.
"aquarius, houston. we're receiving csm data now."
can we go back now to the very first one?
"yes, i think so."
"for solo sampling and then a pan by jack, i presume, and then the gravimeter and then leave. and, jack, you might check your film. we aren't quite sure where you are right now, before you get too far from the rover."
...
...
"okay, karl. just for your information, i finally dug all the way through a-8 and got a hold of the quick disconnect. and it's - it's as i expected it. but, it was there, and we're squared away now."
"foot per second - does that sound right for del - for range rate, right now? 1-97"
...
"okay, challenger; america. good luck on your pdi burn there. i'm going to track your landmark for you ·"
"why don't you keep grabbing a few, and i'm going to - -"
"boy, jim, the sunset is spectacular."
"*#* the dark slide out of bravo, and it's in the dirt. i'm not going to pick it up. okay. i'm changed. and i don't know what the mag count is, but let me get the dsea. if this thing is true to form, i'm going to have to get *** tripped. *** what's *** got some rocks in that big bag. okay. we're done with the sep. dsea is coming out. *** there's something on it."
that's what i'm looking for.
okay. i'll do that.
"negative. just hold it right there for a minute. okay, ease it down a couple of feet. okay, i have it now. thank you."
how about the jettison bag?
go ahead.
"well, you'll have 21 days to get rid of it. ..., are they?"
"okay, stand by. your first one'll be a 60-second exposure time and i'll - it'll be at 55:53."
okay; why don't - do you want another swath?
"no, i can't verify either. we checked them over before undocking and - i can't tell you whether it popped or it was open."
"say again your last. 04 16 12 16 i_p they came - both came down here rubbing their hands, shivering. it's pretty cool upstairs."
you ready?
copy 1.9. thank you.
"okay, charlie. we copy that. p"
"no, that's against the rules. it would be good if we could do it. not these, though. we know it runs through this circuit breaker, so we could pull it out and cut it if you want it, but with neat ..., there's nothing that had to be cut."
"no, the situation, jim, is that your hatch is as good as any other hatch but that we won't have a chance to verify it until so late in the game, like 1 hour before entry interface, in thss case; whereas before, why, we had a chance to evaluate it in lunar orbit. over."
"the time? 0b 14 39 48 _ yes, we're at the edge of marginis."
roger; understand. we'll break them down and hold off until we see you on the other side.
everybody's doing a good job; they're holding their temper.
"nos we - we only have about six more sleeping pills left_ or seven, or something. i don't know."
tranquility base. roger. we verify; those are correct.
"right. sps pitch and yaw, four, to open."
which way?
that's it? you got one quad. that's all okay. everything's all right. ail the quads are gray.
okay. looking good. turn my suit press up. coming on up. do i need ...k check now?
"hi, bob; got a presleep checklist for you."
one - one more.
okay. we're on our way.
"yes, i want - what'd you say, 082, didn't you, bob?"
"well, listen, this is m_ first geology stop. i guess i'm entitled to do that; bob, you ready for a mark?"
okay.
"well, let's hope. keep your fingers crossed, and i'll be more careful around the fenders."
okay. 94:20:20.
"yeah, i think."
yes.
"okay. bit rate, low. time skip"
okay .... the rover.
- - a lot of light.
"- - and you'll be 17,000 feet south."
"okay. on checklist g/8-2 under step 5, tbert_'s a statement, ""disable all jets on two adjacent quads,"" and that's what we were referring to when we called up saying ""disable quads a and b."" so that's all fine; however, going down now to step 7 where it says ""enable all jets,"" we hoped that you didn't think we meant leave a and b disabled there. in that case, it's as written. ail jets should be enabled. over."
okay. walk away from it. easier.
"okay; a few interesting differences there. index is much more subtle than we've seen on the simu- lator. and earthlight is much sharper with a much deeper shadow. _- 04 02 53 43 cc copy, dave."
"what time did you say the time was, tpi? 110:20. you going to have to fold that over. lift it up by the camera. other camera's in here."
we just have los? no. i don't know. got any signal strength there? no? okay .... okay.
"yes, we're all right for that."
"and, joe, here's some readings for you."
i did - i did - i did. i remembered - i remembered.
*** you reach it?
"and i'm looking down into the floor of dollond t, and it looks like dollond t has two different units: one that kind of floods in from the west - looks like it sort of fills the floor there. all that stuff that we talked about and all those things we looked at on the plotter are apparently below the resolution of what i can see with these binocu- lars. and, in general, as the sun comes up, my first impression at the lower sun was that the ma- terial to the - of stone and smoky were the s_e and that the descartes furrowed material was also part of the same thing. as the sun angle comes up, it starts to change its character a little bit, and it's looking more like the plotter photos."
"... p41, we're plus 1.9, minus 0.2 and zero. un- dock and sep, on time."
roger. stand by.
"america, i've got some words about what you might use for optional cur [?] optional photographs. over."
egress verified.
"what i was really trying to do, bob, was get out of chlorinating the potable water, but you wouldn't bite."
"just about the same size, ron. maybe just a tad bigger."
"roger, falcon. we're ready for your ascent bat ontime and your ed bat report."
"houston, how about astro switch 17"
"i copy minus 0.1, minus 0.2, minus 1.4. 05 22 58 37 i_mp okay, i got them."
"oh, yeah. and i spun around and looked at the moon, too. the thing that impresses me, though, is how black it is, ken. yeah, is it blackl"
that must be gatsby over there.
"yes, connector was wedged in there."
"that's affirmative. and, odyssey, we've got another configuration for you. ail 16 rcs auto select off. all rcs heaters off. over."
"i guess parker's all we had left down there to brief them on the landing site, huh?"
"and if i could ever get ron out of the kitchen, we'd get into ptc."
"that's correct. back to panel 5. circuit breaker eps sensor signal, ac 1 and 2, closed. 05 06 h9 27 cmp stand by, ken. i'm going to switch omnis here. you got cut out."
then what?
at 95:28.
and - - 04 16 10 44 co we asked him a long time ago if he was able to see any stars out the optics. i don't think we ever got an answer.
"houston, tranquility. did you all come up with (tranq) aay other solution that we might try to the mission timer problem? over."
"no, i didn't feel any muscle fatigue .... well, jim, why don't we go through this thing now? we're going to be ..."
"13, houston. go ahead."
"houston, 16. we're going through the pre - pre- sleep check - checklist. if you're ready, we'll send you an e-mod."
roger. we see your verb 47.
"yes, i like the reminder, bob."
"houston, aquarius."
"okay, he'll get it for you in a minute."
we'll tell you when you get back.
"roger, al. how deep did you finally end u_ getting down?"
"jim, could you switch your biomed switch to the position opposite to where it is now? we are getting a subcarrier, but no data. over."
"okay, scratch laser altimeter."
"roger, aquarius. we are reading you about the same, about 2-by. 03 01 03 34 imp okay."
... pressure?
get this ball lined up?
... say accretion ... never have ... down there - -
your what?
"yes, but mine's been down all the time, bob."
what are you going to do with them?
...
"you're not harrassing me. when my arm's rested, i'll try again."
okay?
i think - -
just a minute ...... there.
and we were on inverter 2 for a while.
okay.
"occasionally, the back end breaks - occasionally, the back end breaks loose, but there is no problem. this is really some machine."
very good. it sounds like a beautiful view from up there. you've seen a lunar eclipse of the moon twice as big as anyone else has ever seen such an eclipse.
"okay; all the talkbacks are still gray, houston. it's pitching around now."
spacecraft calling houston? say again.
here's a goddamn cliff and a bunch of mountains. look at them! r--- day 4 page 129
"36, 36, that would be - -"
"... c0 03 01 40 c_ okay. 00 03 o1 }! cdn verb 62. 00 03 01 l2 c},_p so we'll come off and, if this needle is negative, i'll go to pitch to accel con$:_d, szart i{ up, s_ni, when she goes across, you'll give me zwc pros - 00 03 0i 50 cdr l_e pros. 00 03 ol 51 chp and i'll go to rate coiel_nd, alid we'll _'ame on around. okay?"
"roger. those are your eva scissors, too, aren't they?"
okay. ands jims i saw the landing site as we passed over it. we're not going to have any trouble recognizing it from the rays. the rays stand out beautifully.
descent engine's armed.
okay; we'll do one of those.
"97 o1 30. correction on that, neil. 97 - make that 97 03 30."
"couldn't copy that, jim. sorry."
"you are referring to the photography of the ser- vice module, is that right?"
that's right. that's verb 49.
"okay, you speak."
"okay, thank you. 04 16 57 b6 cdr-lm okay, bob, we're in the middle of the first para- graph on - at 115:15 in the time line."
"okay, star 21."
"boy, you certainly aren't very loud."
"you going to get on, jack, or walk back? dealer's choice."
"oh, shoot. al'il -"
"okay, tell me when you're ready. the next one's 5 seconds."
"okay, they are standby and off. i'll wait 30 seconds before i take the image motion, off. hey, thank you, stu, that was a big help."
"hello, houston. this is falcon. go."
roger.
"hey, jack, that's your bag that's hanging by one hook. let me go get it."
about 50 - 50 yards.
"roger. that sounds pretty good, john. we - we did look at a backup procedure here, but it's a long - looks like a long thing and involves using a needle and pulling things together like you're sewing."
"did you get it all in, al? 04 05 41 2b cmp sure did, dave. right down to the gnat."
"okay. now you']l back out fairly quickly after you go into this proeeffure. ail we'll need is about 5 minutes of tm, and so if you're ready to copy, here it comes."
"okay, gene. are the three scbs inside the hatch already?"
"okay, jim. looks like your rates are damped sufficient. recommend that you go ahead with the verb 25, noun 07, enter bit on down through the verb 34, enter, and then wish you'd stand by for us to look at it again before you go beyond that. over."
"right. 0t 09 54 31 cmp but that's one of the things we reported and the plate that goes over the bungee fairing is cocked slightly. and now that we've got everything cleaaed out of the tunnel, i can look in here. it's real obvious that the bungee hasn't fired completely. it's down; the top of the bungee is recessed about a half of an inch down. it looks like it just hadn't triggered and, as a matter of fact, i'm looking at the latch and, by golly, i can see between the latch and the total ring, so it didn't even pull down against that. and i really obviously don't have any concern for it; except i'm - i've never seen one that looked just like this and i was gonna go ahead and recock it and fire it again and see how that worked with a manual trigger. but i got to thinking maybe that's - maybe it's best to let you folks think about it. the main thing i want to do is make sure it's not a problem in unlatching it when the time comes."
"okay, houston. aux tv is going to tv now."
"okay, we got some more stuff on the other side ... - -"
"copy, al. second question, do you want me to con- tinue giving the - you these real-time marks on air - air-to-ground, just before and after various camera passes? tape1bo/6"
okay.
"and diverter valve, vertical."
"roger, al. and i've got the map update - -"
"that's just a sample of the kind of - kind of dust we would have got, jack, if we hadn't of had that fender yesterday. fender's almost worn out."
and commander retrieved his yesterday.
okay. fine; thank you.
that's main a.
"everything looking good. o0 00 l0 57 i_mp we're looking good, jim; trajectory's looking good."
"roger, endeavour; this is houston. we're going to run the comm check coming up here, but we'd like to go ahead and get the - the procedures here in the flight plan as we go, and i'll give you a hack be- fore the pan camera start time. the pan camera status, by the way, it's running about 70 percent okay; getting about 70 percent good pictures, and we're going to use nominal procedures. over."
yes.
"... it just - yes, it just went."
okay.
"okay, we'll be there. 03 02 28 xx begin lunar rev 1"
figures.
yes.
yes. 0kay.
"we're talking about the debris that's exposed on the - the north wall - of spur. and the slope here at spur is - oh, 8 to lo degrees."
"okay, that sounds good."
"okay, vance. go ahead."
"1, 2, b, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, *** 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and it's gone. tape62/4"
"yes, look at it. good."
"okay. okay, 2 seconds. count now, one, 1000; two, 1000; off."
c_:ahead.
"okay, now. hold the phone. let's see."
"hold on the pyro arm, ken."
"okay, we'll watch it for a minute here and let you know."
"ail right, back off."
roger. that affirm. we can put cores in gray soil all the time.
"okay. had nv headset off here, and i wasn't paying much attention when aos came."
"it sure is. it sure is. pretty h,,mmoeky and driving is much sportier. 06 01 00 25 i_4p-eva yes."
yes.
"373 is 0182.0; acs delta-vs: plus 0103.7, plus five zeros, minus 0049.3; golf, 113:57:00.00; hotel, 11 - okay, i'll start over. 115:36:45.00; and the no doi-2 delta-vx, 0096.6. two remarks: throttle profile is 10 percent for 26 seconds, 40 percent for the rest of the burn. over."
"yes, that sounds like - sounds like a good plan to me."
"that's down to your right. yes ... yes, that's what i mean, you would thrust - you would thrust up. okay. i think i got it killed again."
"look, let's check it out when we get out, joe."
"man, that lift-off was something, wasn't it? 07 07 5823 cdr that was neat."
(sneeze) 07 22 b8 16 lmp ...
i guess i'm going with that. what you got on the ags?
we don't want to do that.
roger. we got good data.
"joe, how far out do ycu show us now?"
we have ignition.
"yes, i got a couple. i hope they're good."
"jack, you using the binocs? _mip yes, i talked abouv dawes already but - nos those aren'v coles dcwr_there_ those are _us_ greaz bzg - graam big blocks thav have fallen off zke side of vhe modemv,ain. side of the - okay. _mp okay, between the tan gray and the very light gray there may be another thin and possibly intermittent zone of a - just a plain, apparently gray unit forming in the talus slope. 08 23 08 16 _ and the crater to the southeast of - southwest - excuse me_ of dawes - large crater, i'll get the name in a minute, you see the lower bluish-gray unit and - and the next white unit or light-gray unit up, but the brown-gray unit is not nearly so evident at the top. in fact, i didn't really say i could recognize it there at all. i'll have to check that one, though. put a query by it."
"okay. 05 09 06 3)4 cc under ac bus a, close gasta. ob 09 06 h3 [,mi' okay. gjlgta flight displays and ac bus a will be closed. (}'_09 06 47 cc roger. that's all on the second line. now t?? third line, under stahlity and control, atca (pghs) to closed."
"okay. i copied that, jack. and is this crater to the east or west?"
"awful lot of line there, isn't there?"
"first time you ever got a set that worked, huh?"
"okay, bob, as far as any of the things we talked about trying to see at the surface, dynamics or a variation of the light mantle, i think you've heard it all, there isn't much to say about the dynamics right now. i have a feeling that the surfaces are old enough that all those kind of detailed relationships have been obscured .... is just about the same all over here, it varies, but there are no systematics that i've seen."
"well, you'd know if you got the screw in the slot."
"here, i should get out my checklist .... o0 00 40 i0 lmp optics - let's see. no, i don't see that. it says po0 - -"
it was up there a while ago.
"bob, how do you read 177"
(yelling) good.
"okay 17. challenger, we are ready for jettison."
"tallest man on the moon right now. okay, that's done."
"roger. i'd say he was dividing everything by 10. and, dave, be advised the program - -"
pressures look good.
burn's complete.
roger.
"oh, man, are we down among them, babe! whooh! ..."
"that's affirmative, pete."
see it?
pretty tasty water.
that's fine. we just won't - bother the lm with it.
"and, odyssey, houston. we're also sending you a final pipa bias update and clock increment. over."
"ok - okay, bob; understand. mass spec discriminator to low."
yes. getting farily close. 03 13 26 00 _p how far are we away from that attitude? confidenti/
"0kay_ jack. i think he answered us, but he was completely lost in the noise. i could just barely hear somebody talking. could he hear us okay?"
yeah. let's see what -
"roger. i was sure, too, but i had to ask the question."
okay. give me a countdown at 6 minutes.
okay.
start the countdown?
"yes, because we're starting upslope."
can't you do that for me?
"how's our friend, the lmp, doing?"
okay. stand by. i'll check.
okay. checking them off.
"bob, let's get it straight. you w - want - let's get it straight, you want the north overhang sample in the sec - or the short can?"
do you guys think - -
okay - one.
"negative. as soon as you have the picture, i'll tell you where to look."
"bob, would you tell me what your primary desires are again on the 500, based upon what we have?"
"roger. just a reminder, ron, we don't want to tear you away from your window if you don't want to, but this is your eat period."
go ahead.
did you get a good picture of it?
"yes, sir. that's how we tell these days. although it doesn't happen all the times and i guess as long as - whenever we have that waste vent, closed, we probably wouldn't be bothered by it at night."
okay. who's going to take the terminator photos. you want me to give you call about 2 minutes before the photo time?
"oh, 0.4. l_p-eva yes, that 's the range."
we might have them sorted out by then.
"okay, at 211:02. add the following at 211:02: uv cover closed, and, in parentheses, put 211:02:09. configure dse - -"
sure will. wish i could blow on it.
you did it after the optics power was turned on?
"oh, boy."
roger; xx.
"that's funny. looks like it fits in there pretty well. oh, what's in - okay. you're going to put the camera on anyway."
"no, i just want to see it...."
"it's got a few blocks around it. tony, i can see that one downslope that you wanted us to stop at that's at station 5. it's - it won't be any trouble getting there, but if you give us a vector, that'll be certain."
that looks good. that looks good. hold that heading.
okay. you by me so i can set the gnomon down.
radar needles are off.
my fuel is kind of low.
"oh, man."
"houston, did you want us to test the cameras in the lm and - i was wondering about that. i saw it in the flight plan, but i'm just wondering if you want to do that on csm power, or do you want us to take both of the 16mm cameras back in the csm and test them there? over."
roger.
yep.
"acquire msfn; pitch, minus 64."
"okay, i'm glad you found something."
"okay. i've got them right here; when they get ready to go. ought to be going with our suits, now."
that's right.
"did you torque it, jim?"
()kay.
"say, again, john; i didn't copy that."
... move over there.
now.
roger. i expect that's the case. let us check it.
"oh, ... side."
"and if you didn't see our residuals, it was 0.1 x, 0.2 on y, and 0.1 z, and delta-v c was minus 3.8."
"why don't you go over and - over towards jack, gene, and then the two of you can pick up the scoop and the bag together and get back towards the rover after that?"
okay.
"and, jim, earlier in the evening, we thought there was a misunderstanding about the amount of pot_]_ water you can drink, but we want to advise you that you can drink as much water as you want to. there's 38 pounds in the potable tank, and that's about all you'll need. the doctors suggest you drink as much fruit juices as you want, too."
roger.
"ken, the comm's pretty bad right now. we're having a hard time getting that. we understood that the light meter indicates that the film that was indicated to use here probably isn't going to be fast enough, and you're asking to use a faster film. but we didn't und - get there, how severe the problem was. 02 08 22 47 cml° houston, 16."
okay.
oscillating between i and 0.09.
"well, i tell you, going down to that crater i_; not a problem. getting back up is."
ken's taking some time in dressing this thing up to get these attitudes right.
no. sure don't.
okay.
...
"okay, ken. we no longer need min dead b_nd. we'd like a - ... okay, ken. we no longer need min dead band. we'd like an 06 noun 20."
okay.
"okay. the range and range rate at insertion: range rate is 137; range, minus - sorry, the range is 137; range rate, minus 431; at plus 5 minutes, range 117; range rate minus 398; and at 10 minutes, range is 98, range rate minus 355."
master arm is off.
"' floodlights, all."
"does it look like you are going to be able to do (eagle) this without burning thrusters, mike? (goss net 1) tape 64/7"
"okay. we're heading to station 9 *** about 267. okay, and they're reading us through the lm, so i won't worry about the low gain. we're pc_ering up. the switch is on. okay, i'm going to make a turn to the right."
"i would guess we're about 100,000 miles out. yes."
okay. that's complete. the next step is to switch to the primary co2 canister and remove the secondary canister and stow it. over.
aha the regolith - -
"on row 2, flight displays, open thrust, open mission timer, open range/range rate, altitude/ altitude rate, and open the ac bus a range rate, altitude/altitude rate."
"that's got it. t_q) 04 1! 07 21 cdr *** right. tranq) 02 ]p 07 30 cdr fastest vox in the west. tp_nq) 04 i_ 07 37 l_e° mark. all right. okay. tr_iq) 01412 07 43 i,_p aren't they? trai{q)"
"and aos should occur at 5 - and a half. oh, man, look at that. isn't that clever? somebody really did a lot of good work here. my little photo wheel, i'll put right here. it's on ... now let's see if we can see some electricity. binoculars, put up; dark side goes out. man, that's a super crew - some octopuses that!s trying to balance three check- lists, two cameras, a photo wheel; take your *voice played back from portable tape recorder. **voice played back from portable tape recorder at double speed. sunglasses on and off and not lose them. well, here comes our old friend king. this time let's look at king out to the north. seems like i never get set up in time. all these ... 05 01 33 23 _ well, we'll get a good view of king. let's see what's out this way. there's that minor crater chain, running down to tsiolkovsky. it's a little bit disappointing. there is nothing you can see from the south of king. boy, i'd swear we were seeing things when we were down lower."
it'll take up to 15 degrees.
got it in my pocket - -
"yes, sir. 07 03 08 23 cdr-i_m great. i'll tell you, cold tomato soup isn't too good."
yes. read them off.
"intrepid, we've tried to isolate it. it appears as though it's coming on the downlink where it's coming from the lm."
okay. o0 00 06 2_ cmp check your gpis?
yes.
yes. guess - i guess what we ought to do is not get this clean stuff dirty. they really ought to have a - another neat bag for the dirty stuff.
30 k.
roger. understand.
"okay. and, jim, i can give shaft and trunnions if - if he's interesteb."
okay. ems mode to normal.
"good show. and, john, while you're down there, verify that the battery covers - the lrv battery covers are open and the circuit breakers are all pulled on the lev."
"okay, houston. we're starting ptc. we're disabling quads a and b now."
okay. i was just going to read them to you. we got them.
"no. this thing just catches this in a can down there, ken."
auto.
... open.
"we thought this thing had changed color, but i think it's just dust. look, we rubbed into that battery, and it's getting shiny again. let me get a shot on it."
"roger, pete. we copied that comment. were you able to get a photo of that in the first eva?"
"it is. over here to our ll o'clock. i mean, no - no, i'm sorry, you're right. i was thinking of a different one, jim. november has a raised rim which is, i think, unique around here."
okay. what you're saying is you kind of have to wait until the - there is no sun reflection on the lm to see the stars. is that right?
"stereo, even."
"boy, i guess."
mark lmp. same position; intensity 4; flash. time skip
"houston, 15. roger; will do."
how about the big bag?
"thank you, dick."
the point is my hands will be much better off without them.
"okay, 13; houston. that's affirm. at the flight- plan-scheduled time."
"16, houston. would you attempt to bring up the high gain?"
",dh, okay."
"okay, gordo, the charge should be terminated on bat b."
"hey, hank. if you got time while i'm - while i can listen, and - how about telling me if there's - you got any words on the general eva plan for the surface and - guys are doing."
"okay. depending on what part you're looking at, it's cold there, too. we got you, though. you got your refsmmat, you can go back - -"
...
"5, 4, 3, 2, 1 - -"
i understand a portion of the mesa blanket's still on the - on the fronz.
"oh, i'd say the - the - the last folding lip is up against the handrail. well, it - yeah, just about that far."
okay. now let me see. you're suppose to drive 45 degrees to the sun. okay?
"okay, and we're about 30 seconds from the t-start time on the pan camera, please."
"gdc align; det, reset."
"oh, okay, that's the heading."
so am i. yes.
roger that.
roger.
"roger; it's the middle star. 04 09 26 30 cdr-i_m sure, old aludiman! f"
hey. got coffee?
"okay, 17. to begin with, we want you to delete that step going to downvoice backup. and i've got a surface block data to read up to you. a few minor changes in your lunar surface checklist. and a couple of very quick questions for the de- briefing when you're ready. over."
"hear it? gurgle, gurgle, gurgle, gurgle, gurgle."
down that side.

yeah. we're - doing just like old 97_ really really moving down the track.
ready to copy.
and my water is open.
"houston, apollo 17. when we ran the delta-v test, we - we're reading minus 22.2 and i'm having a little trouble finding the sps cue card. wonder if fao know exactly - knows exactly where that is?"
"oh, excuse me. excuse me."
"okay. oh, that doggoned thing's not going to - that tape is full of dust now. okay. wait a minute, jack."
"yes, joe, go ahead."
i threw that?
okay. you're readable. lots of background noise at the moment.
"okay, tony. be advised i'm sorry that i'm spiking this thing out occasionally, but this is the only way we can do it."
- - descent looks good. (eagle )
"... zero phase, ... of which is 4, 5/6ths, let me - that would be - that would be ... 4 5/6ths."
"okay, we've already decided that we are going to go with the pgns. ail the solutions look good on our onboard comparison, gordo."

okay. i'll do the - the stuff that comes up right 1
"well, i tell you, i - i'm - i'm really confused, because i am thoroughly convinced that what john's been saying about everything goes up to the tunnel is true. and in sim bay attitude with only the minus-x jets firing, that makes sense. and it's true i'll wake up in the morning, and the - the tool e is always hanging that way, the jett bag's up there, all my trash is going up there. it's a - it's a self-cleaning cockpit. 07 22 28 41 i_p yeah."
can i load p30 now?
it won't work.
"okay, give me verb 76, charlie."
"okay, we'll take a look at it here while you're sleeping."
"well, we'll check it here on the repress."
roger; 9.1.
"no. no, not until after i've given h seconds of ullage forward. 00 03 03 _2 _ okay, i just wanted to verify - - 00 03 03 h3 c},_p you should be looking for the s-ivb - there goes a pm:el cut there. you can see it drifting cut. 00 03 03 49 llv_ yes, there it is."
"are you ready for us to press on here, gordy? we're all stowed and - in pretty good shape in the lm."
understand.
okay.
let me know when we're near there. 04 12 h6 56 cdr we've got a long way to go.
yes.
you hit it right on the money.
okay. src number i weighs 42 pounds.
question number 2 - -
"joe, did you have any trouble with mine last night, or is it just since i put the suit on?"
that's affirmative.
"roger, dave."
"jim, regarding window 5, i have a drawing here; and, when you're docked, you have approximately a 60-degree angle between the z-axes of the two spacecraft. it appears that peering out win- dow 5, you would be looking at the rendezvous radar on top of the lm which would, if you pitched, more or less give you a view of the service module. that is, if you pitched, so - from - and i think that this has been run by quite a few folks here; so, offhand, i can't see where any other window would be as good or per- haps even possible."
"endeavour, this is houston. i guess we can go ahead with the plane change data anytime you're ready to copy."
"and, jim, don't hesitate to fire off pictures right and left here. we've got lots of film. 06 20 53 22 i_4p-eva oh, i wish i - i wish i could, joe."
"it's coming out of window l, right now, jack, and could you give me the thrusters again?"
"22, 23, 24, 25, 26 - 04 08 17 52 cdr/lmp throttle upi"
"well, we checked it. it's all closed. l0 08 51 59 imp flow just went to 0.2 here, pete."
roger.
okay. looks good.
"and just to let you guys know that i'm not easily swayed and made soft by such shows of sentiment, i want to remind the cdr and the lmp that they're going to start collecting their urine from now on, and you shouldn't have been dumping it since 197:00."
roger. understand we're go.
- - to go to 12 frames per second.
"- - we've decided it's about time you start on your station 8 trench, if you would, please."
okay. i'll get - i'll get this soil.
i've got to get my 02 off. 05 1! 26 39 lmp you ready? okay. let's see what that says. iconfident
"roger. get 130 hours 30 minutes, delta-v x 2.0, roll zero, pitch 230, yaw zero, delta-vc, 2.0."
what switch?
"no problem. 02 12 31 _2 cc america, houston. we're all ready for the e-mod dump, if it's convenient to you."
"okay - - 03 15 39 24 c_ okay, gordon. oh, ye of little faith. _u_ don't sweat all - all the reminders. 03 15 39 l5 t_p he could interpret that to mean don't give you those little reminders. 03 15 ho 03 cdr no_, there's a good song. _at's the ns_me of that son of a bitch? 03 15 40 c7 cml: ""truck driving man."" 03 15 ho 10 _ can i put this under here? it's the only 3ne i've got big enough to hold it. 03 15 ho 12 cdr yes. go ahead."
"okay. roger. understand based on a targeted (columbia) landing site; t1, 104 32 18; t2, 104 37 28, and 4 miles south."
...
"yes, sir. just like we done it on the surface. we did the zippers, all of the o-rings, the neck rings, the wrist rings, and it seems to me, hank, it's really not where the o-ring is. it's in the sliding part between the suit part and the locking part of it. it's stiff. you could see dust down in there, but you can't get it out too well."
"okay. and it looks good, babe."
180.
57:20? didn't they change that on us?
"okay, challenger. we've got those angles here on the ground - -"
"okay, i wonder what happened. on the check - the comm checks we did at 55 hours, of course, it was closer, but it was real good then, i thought."
that's up to you. cdr-_ta yes.
"okay. on 16, ecs lgc [sic] pump, close. why don't you close it again? 05 17 3i 44 lmp okay, it's closed."
okay.
charlie's only said 25 times it's black out there.
yes. what do i - where are those? okay. where's mv book? lost my bag - supposed to take that one.
okay. pump 2.
okay. thank you.
"take about 4 minutes, al, and i'll call you after that."
that's what i was telling you. how about that rock right there?
"no, sir."
"what you got? _,.22 47 ii lmp that's what i have, 04076. 03 22 a7 13 ..r'r' roger."
"houston, 17's getting the high gain up, if you want it."
"orion, will you go hi bit rate, again?"
yes.
let me get up here. okay?
roger. and i think we can expect a fairly large z at the recycle.
houston. casper.
"besides, you're gonna replace all that with rocks."
okay. you don't have it nulled. that's - you've got full ...
it looks like an olive branch over there.
"and how does 13 hours of continuous zero g feel? 00 lb 26 33 cdr well, i think everybody is pretty well adjusted, karl; no problems at all, and we've finished din- ner and we're happy."
"okay, fred. only - only a minor point that we just picked up. at thc,very top, ei minus 6 hours, the title is ""power up,"" _cbove bat 5 nopmal feed, on."
"easy does it, that's a boy. master caution, an aco sep light, and an ecs light; that's the ones we wanted."
"trouble is, there's too much backing up ... determine ..."
"i'm going to - diverter valve, horizontal. 05 cdr-lm suit isol, both. i'm going suit flow, get some flow in this cabin. okay."
okay. here - here's a bag.
"okay. 00 00 40 46 cr_ it is definitely off, right?"
... there you go.
"the answer to that is yes, bob. i think it's partly - partly faa, but it's also the fact that we did a lot of circling. we didn't drive in many straight lines. trying to find, for the most part, our bearings, amd tried to pick some high spots so we could look around. so i think straight-line navigation out in the area we're going is going to be easily 8 kilometers."
"well, i can't - i can tell you they sure look different. they're all black over there. that's always intriguing_ when you can't see something."
wait a minute.
"houston, 15. loud and clear. _-_ 08 22 26 14 cc roger, 15. we're reading you loud and clear. we have flight plan updates available anytime you're interested in copying it."
"apollo 11, houston. stand by for your miss distance. over."
"are we in the right dap, you suppose?"
"houston, endeavour."
"hey, houston. why don't i give you lmps menu this morning, too - day 5?"
"want me to do it, john?"
okay.
i'm not sure what we had when it started. i just noticed the strerming. i don't think it was on very long.
verify locked. okay.
"roger. j 05 05 46 52 cdr-eva hey, joe, i need a i_oger-0ut 0f that so i know you're ..."
do we?
"yes, that's true. i guess it will pay for us all to do that tomorrow night."
"ron, go receive only. 04 11 0b 46 cdr houston, hardover looked good from here. 04 11 ob 50 cc okay; looked good down here."
oh.
"okay. delete the three lines at 179:40, ""laser altimeter,"" ""mapping camera covers,"" and ""logic power, off."" delete those three lines."
"yes. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 -"
"by the time we get ready, we - we've got to go back and land. of all the dumb things (laughter)."
"i just noticed on the plot board here, it looks like you're come up on 20,000 miles out, right about now."
roger.
but - i think you've got something right ahead of you. here -
"let's see, the area is pretty well policed up over there. i'll - when i come back to get the core tubes, i'll pick it up."
huh?
"as i slowly go up here, how about snapping a few of those things in?"
that's what it says. it's been written in here.
"okay. mode control, ags, att hold."
roger.
"okay. let me do it right now, joe, just - don't - so we don't forget it."
and you're on your own.
yes. it won't take us long to get the tunnel clear.
"- - and cdr, 80 percent, also. c( nf1dent"
"okay, great. those things - those things are really something, don. there were a couple of the phenomena that i had seen previously that i didn't see today_ but there were some other ones today that were different too. the phenomena - the flashes leave no afterglow and they're - they're just instantaneous. ail the colors are white - were all we saw. we saw no colors at all; neither john nor i. it was - every one we saw was white."
i'm so far behind on exercise now that i may never exercise again. it's really gonna hurt when i get back and have to go to work.
okay. if i can get my seatbelt on.
"uplink sqtjelch, enable? 06 18 51 10 _._ ***_6le."
stand by on that. i've just got - back at 252:20. i was just given the word that we will not -
what?
"no, i've been checking it, bob, my biggest prob- lem is that the flags don't anchor."
"i sure missed hearing it click, but they are locked. one of them is, anyway. hey, jack. i verify - -"
... exact ...
"okay, 1456, 76747."
"roger, ron. it's minus - minus 160.39."
this is to power up the csm? ob 05 06 24 cc that's affirm.
"okay. and then next, you go down to the other panel, and we go deploy for 20 seconds on the mass spec boom, and then retract for 40 seconds, or until we get a gray indication. over."
yes. 04 13'34 8 cdr i need another shot of cold.
ready?
"dave or jim, could you give us an estimate of the ... numbers of rock - rock types you're looking at. have you seen two populations so far?"
"at 193:04, we're gonm_ give you the hc{ jettison p_cl. 07 21 49 24 ck'p okay. /',ndwhere will vha% go? we're gonna go back to the other - v_e other part of the book?"
"okay, 2 minutes to go, ken."
yes.
when do we shut it off? do you shut it off ...?
roger.
"roger. it went in to within about a degree. and in fact, as you know, it doesn't - the exact point isn't all that important. it - it went in just about where we wanted it, though. _"
we have everything from the very old subdued craters that are almost completely washed out to the very bright fresh ones which have interior walls of almost pure white.
stand by.
"but if 6/7 requires more time when we get there, we can borrow it from one of the other stations; i guess, in particular, station 10, probably. as the initial activity then, we are going to have to take explosive package 5 with us, and we'll stick it under the lmp seat, and i'll remind you in real time when we get down on the ground on that one. and number 5, 3 pound, will be deployed at station 10, and again i'll remind you about that in real time, so don't - you don't have to bother to write it in on your checklist. planned traverse proceeds as normal. we're expecting to spend about an hour and 20 minutes at stations 6 and 7, and the sugges- tion is that we may end up wanting to spend that totally at the split boulder at station 6, hut, of course, the option still exists to visit more than one place and sample other boulders if it seems feasible and attractive and desirable. they are suggesting additional 500-millimeter photographs, especially if it seems that we can use those to document tracks and sources of docu - of the sampled boulders; for instance, at stations 6 and 7. we are continuing to hold the nominal 47 minutes at station 8 - that is, 8a, and we still think that's as good a place as any to sample the sculptured hills. station 9 is still nominal 30 minutes, but in view of the similarities to the in - to station 4, we're anticipating a possible desirability to remove time from station 10 to enlarge station 9, but that will have to be a real-time decision, based upon what we find at station 9. station 47 - station 10 continues nominal. we're still interested in sampling the blocks and also interested in - in trenching to try and see - if we can say something about the dark mantle - light area relationship and, perhaps, the nominal coring. we're going to - we're going to deploy ep 5 there; and, other than that, they're basic- ally the same. if we have the time during that closeout, and you'll know if we have enlarged the closeout somewhat, of the lm, based on our experience the last two nights, particularly for dusting; but also, if time permits, in that time we might try and get the - use up the extra double core, if there is one, in the dark mantle near the i_mor do some trenching near the i/4. but that's only if time permits at the very end, depending upon how the consumables run out. they want to call attention to two particular things here. one, since you guys really haven't gotten any very big rocks so far, they're recommending, they say here, and i quote: ""the value of large individual samples has been demonstrated. we recommend that several football-sized samples of a uniform igneous rock be collected at station 9 or 10."" i'll pass that on as that. another point of interest is the l- to 20- millimeter size section of the regolith, the dark mantle, the lithology. then, any observations or collec- tions you can make pertinent to that would be of interest in trying to determine the relationship of the dark mantle to the subfloor units of gabbro underneath. two short questions which i'll ask, which i hope - hope you can answer in just a very few words. one of them is a yes and no answer. one, we - they can't find the geophone photos specifically called out in the transcript. there is probably a little bit of garble at that point, and the people in the back room will be very happy if you could say once and for all, jack, that, yes, you did get the geophone photos. over. 06 14 50 03 ijmp-lm yes."
and i guess consumables update. that's mainly yours.
"roger. good readback, jim."
"hold it, and i'll get on the end there of the - with the ..."

"roger, 15. it looks good to us down here."
"no, get the soil, guys. get the soil. don't. forget the soil; get the soil."
"the television coverage had you all the way through staging very well on - and the s-ii ignition. then, you went right behind a cloud for a while, but they were tracking you pretty well."
and it feels like it's going up.
"he's got to go up like that .... our mechanics, it may not ..."
"roger, tranquility. we'd like to hold off as long as possible on the lithium hydroxide canister. make that one of the last things you do in getting ready for the depress, if you can. over."
i can ... (laughter). no wonder he wanted a ...
okay.
- - antenna is 240 and we're ready for you guys to leave.
very good. understand.
gene cernan.
"stand by, ken. i'll get an answer for you, and we're working on whether we got a stay or not on t-1."
put stem number 2 on.
okay. we'll hold this.
go ahead.
"okay .... see how close that baby is before we - e, ."
thumbwheel control. 0.96 plus 0.96 minus 0.23.
"now, don't hit it, al."
i've got a question for you here - -
"okay, that's in work."
"put the monitor over here in my spot right here where i can see you, man."
hey_ tony. tell jobm covington that this _hing is a piece of cake compared to his lightweight training unit.
"no, charlie. watch and see where this line comes out."
watch your shadow.
all right - -
go ahead· 03 04 26 44 cml° i ...
"you want me to reach that, john?"
"ken, should be 48 total frames on the mag, and we show you 42 remaining."
roger.
"yes, it could be. and there are those."
"okay. anyhow, go on over to 181 hours. and this is the real - - 07 05 21 28 c_ okay, 181 - -"
"okay, wait a minute. let me get this thing in, and i'll go back and start on that heat flow. i mean the - can you step away so i don't get these cables?"
"they are really - must have a load on them. okay, and the next one i want to get is the mains."
why?
"okay. right after the ¥,:ltb48 add three steps, number i is ""radar, off."" number 2 is ""hf ante_q1a to retract (off, on stdn cue)."" and the next step is the same for antenna 1. ""hf antenna 1, retract, (off, on stdn cue) ."""
that's affirm. i'm engaged.
roger.
"ail right, our - -"
"okay. you got 66.5 on descent 1 fuel temp, oxidizer temp is 66 degrees."
... a lot of garbage ....
... set.
"dave, you might want to bring the s - esc from under the seat."
"yes, that's affirm. ww on the lunar ..."
"and you are go for tli. huntsville reports that you have a 6-second propellant pad which is 3 seconds more than a 3-sigma case; so you're good on consumables. the iu is so good that we're not going to update it. the only change we have for you is in the tli checklist. at 57 minutes where you slew the fdai to 18 degrees, we recommend 20 degrees there, and we recommend that you look for 8 degrees instead of 6 degrees at ignition. the s-ivb is riding on the top of its deadband."
"heys houston, i don't know where ken is at this point when we missed up into our p52. i trust he is still keeping an eye on us. 04 06 45 ho cc i hope so too."
okay. we copy that.
sure you got it_
okay. copy that. very good.
are we in down voice backup ... 02 20 04 39 i24p yes.
"bob, don't you have the mileages?"
"houston, this is ed. how do you read? oh 17 09 07 cc ed, this is houston. over."
"roger. at 214 plus 50, we delete ""pan camera _-_ mode, standby, and msfn: veri - verify lens tuck in."""
...
"hey, john?"
okay. i think we'll go ahead and burn the pgns. 07 04 22 38 limp ... maneuver now?
"11, houston. a little information to you there, cdr. we've all taken a momentary brief respite from out work here to have some special - to have a bite of special moon cheese that is - i understand it's been sent to us directly from wapakoneta, your own hometown. over."
they've got the data from one that you'd let it do that on a little?
mark gravimeter; it's flashing.
... got ...
yeah.
"okay, what's the bearing and range for that getting off the contact?"
"yes. 06 21 33 3c cc okay, dave. - - 06 21 33 31 i/vip-eva ... you want ...? i should have put this on the lens."
"what? no, i don't know that it's not there. i just didn't look. i ..."
"no, it's not important. wondered what - we hadn't had an update in a while. y'all must have ran out of pa - - time skip"
right.
"okay. it's pretty obvious we want to take ""hf antenna 2, retract"" and move it above ""hf anten- na 1."" we'll call for the retract - make sure we're ready, and we'll also cue it on our cue, ron. what we want to do is look at hf antenna 2 retract all the way, get the times, et cetera, and then we'll go ahead and retract hf antenna 1."
roger. we're following you right on the line.
"yes. i understand, joe. !"
uv card bo°k ...
how you guys doing over there?
okay.
yeah. what do you - what made the comment that you said was really firing one of the thrusters?
"yeah, yeah. 03 02 30 25 cml° about 10."
"that sounded pretty good to me, ken. and we'd like high gain to auto. 05 09 58 32 c_4p okay. there's auto. now. gamma ray, shield off. ah ha. and it 's off."
"fan delta-p, opened."
"okay, we copy. thank you."
"yes, that whole brack - that temporary sto - that bracket? yes. yes, i think i'll probably stow the cardboard in there·"
"16, houston. could you bring up the high gain, pitch plus 35, yaw 290."
these guys are crazy (laughter).
"you know. as i look back behind us. it almost looks like we landed in a - another, oh, l0 meters aft and we'd have been in surveyor crater."
"hello, there. how are you doing?"
"- - and i'll ge_. cat about _wo more _hings to do, looks like, then i'll he all done. it's a good thing i did half of it last night. cml° (humming)"
how about pads? do you need your pa_s?
... it's up.
right. that's right.
roger. did you get my go for rcs?
... is that right?
"okay. can we - since the first part of it, you're just going to read and i_m going to copy and we're going to have a question and answer period later, can we get started? l_age 626 0', 0(, ] _ 5;' (jc okay. l'r'ocr:4ure's coming back in again. multi- copies l'or distribution. and ken's back. he's a local expert on this now, so we'll turn you over to him and he'll read it off."
"couldn't be. look at that; 187,0007 08 22 ll 2_ cc take it back; they rewrote about 38,000."
"let me see. no, that's yaw, pitch, and - okay. everything's ...... that's roll, pitch, and yaw. 03 02 01 29 _ roll, pitch, and yaw."
"okay; the last p52 produced gyro torque of minus 011, minus 007, and minus 002; get torque time was 234:2o 07. and let's just let it suffice to say we torqued on the commander's p52."
yes.
"roger. in answer to your question on the dse, we'll handle the dse from down here when we start the eye-flash experiment. we do have a - a request of you before you start the experiment, though. we don't have the necessary oxygen purity in the lm yet that we think that we're going to need for the surface evas several days from now. and - consequently, we want you to start to vent the lm once again. we're going to drain it out and fill it with oxygen again later on today. so, if you would please, turn the tunnel vent valve to the vent position before we start the eye flash."
"okay_ orion can always tell casper what his problem is, but it looks like an open circuit in the rate feedback and your servo loop. we've run exhaustive tests down here on the west coast and east coast on controllability aspects and structural aspects_ and everything looks satisfactory. on apollo 9, we ran - a similar test was run, as you probably remember. and if such a - such a problem did occur up there, you could expect oscillations, of course, with the gimbal, but you could expect a steady attituae_ it would be a limit cycle. so we're convinced do_¥_ here that we have a satisfactory control mode if we have to revert to that one. over."
i took a bath last night. i think i'll try to shave tonight. starting to itch underneath this helmet.
"oh, yes."
"and, john, why don't you take a pan when you document the location of that lpm tripod. that'll take care of our pan."

now put that large one in my pack.
roger. (laughter)
"yes, it looks like the old gravity gradient worked there or something. i didn't see it get out of attitude at all. did you all see any movement at all?"
"right. if 25 doesn't come up, i'm going to punch it in."
you're on high gain and set up in the proper angles.
"primary; steering to bus delta on the rear, and nothing on the front, drive power is on. drive enables are both squared away. sun shadow device is stowed. and we're ready to go. are you all strapped in?"

master arm is off.
"*** my diverter, min."
"there were - there were some deep sinkholes out there, ken, that must have been 70, 80 meters deep, and they weren't even on the maps."
"it's sure beautiful. it's sure beautiful and, looking back at it, there's several billion people who have got a lot to work for because it's one of the most beautiful sights we've ever seen here."

roger. it's just a short one. one item to change.
_md you're still coming up with a loud squeal.
"yeah, after i asked for it. i could have gone there the first time just as easy."
i never did get the purse back over here yet.

roger. how about the barber pole now?
"yeah. yeah, right."
ready.
"well, tony, that's your house rock right there."
"yes. yes, the next one coming up is 164. and, why don't you skip the rim there, jim."

"tony, i went to minimum on my coolant."
"15, the surgeon says it's okay for the cdr and the"
"roger. 04 14 31 48 i24p and right in this area, there are two craters. the one that's right in front of me now as i lo_k off in about the eleven o'clock position from t_e spacecraft, about 30 to 35 feet ... there's several eral rocks and boulders 6 to 8 inches across ... sizes."
i will. i will.
great.
work good?
"hey, we're already ... this time, huh?"

"okay. okay, let's get our rover sample."
"yes. how about your rendezvous window, jim? o0 gl 21 24 _ it's fine. yes."
okay. mine's closed. inverter 1.
"15, houston. we have a couple of more comments on the uv photo procedures, if somebody can copy."
the horizon is about one quarter of the way up. beautiful.
if we'd picked another place - i can't get the top off.
"15, houston. the computer's yours."
"okay, that'll be a good shot, i think. just a minute. okay, pete."
"oh, yes, that getting in that rover bit."
"the only thing we can try to do, jim, is t,o_et the thing up manually and see what happens. thcre must be a better answer than that"
we copy.
"okay. mine dropped off 1 and 1/2, tony."
"okay, stand by. 07 06 00 01 c_ okay. you got the numbers?"
"yes, mine's good. okay. let me get to your front. l_4p-eva no, i didn't get your other arm here."
"okay. delta - bravo. there's delta. boy, this is certainly a uni - subfloor, as we mapped it. it's certainly a uniform - uniform rock type. i'll tell you. the only variation - are those gray zones which are - just seem to be either finer or the absence of vesicles. boy, i'm nose to nose with a piece of it right now."
"well, let's see how much time it takes. i hope you're right."
okay; we'll torque them at 22:30.
"what i'll do, houston, is get a soil sample off this rim. i - that's the only thing i can he assured of that's descartes right at this point."
"sequence logic, two, off."
got the circle around mount la hire? it's f/ll.
"roger, houston. you've got it."
"casper, houston."
okay.
"oh, is he beautiful! okay. you want about 1/250 at f/ll - or 8. what's your focus?"
(coughing)
"yes, sir. john - -"

"understand on your first - okay, on that first step that you read, it said, if leak stops, to close both dump valves."
we'd like for you to use syst_2_a just as long as possible. over.

"say again, charlie? the double core will be at this rake site, but while you've got the rake out there - -"
"okay. suit gas diverter, pull/egress."
the dump?

"yes, yes. i don't know if i can get a piece back here or not."
po0 and accept. you've got it.
i wonder if i ever turned - i wonder if i ever turned it on?
go. have at it.
there it is! proceeded.
i got a good picture of that.

roger. we copy that. keep - keep going; that sounds great.
"okay, houston. you want us to dump the 0ps again? we're - would like to finally stow it, and we can dump it now if you want."
shoot. i don't have any trouble hearing it. hatch gear box is latch; actuator handle is going to neutral ... - -
"oh, that's right, l0 bravo. i knew i'd never get that straight."
right behind me.
"okay, 30 seconds to t-start time."
"roger. copied; 17 degrees instead of 16, and 14 instead of the 13."
"orion, hous%on. 08 01 32 h7 cmp i haven't got time right now, charlie. he's calling you."
0kay.
"how's the time, bob?"
okay?
(laughter)
okay.
"okay, guys. that's all we've got for you for the moment. dick walked into the mocr a few minutes ago. he says that the test burn procedure went okay. we're going to look it over one last time and then read the procedures to you."
"okay. al, 3.7!5and reading 52 on the oxygen; and i'm in medium flow and i'm comfortable; no flags."
"okay. go ahead, geno."
we got to depress right away.
"hey, joe. the heat flow is leveled, and the shadow is - right between 2 and b on the index."
watch yourself_ you're getting close to the crater.
"well, i'll tell you, it sure is easy to get dusty, but that's nothing new to anybody. okay, babe, let me get - wheel"
"37.8 and 2.3. and that will be our last one for a half hour. thank you. and i'm about to exercise my fifth general order here, and pass it along to joe."
"well, that's not 5 balls, but that's not a bad way to end, i guess. you know, i never noticed it before, but i'm looking next to the - to the earth, right now. and, of course, that makes it a kind of bluish reflection inside the - the sextant, and you can't see the reticle brightness at all. it just - you know, it just comes through as a black - black line in there. and there are two lines. you know, i've got two - one of them must be - there are two - two reticles - no, there are two reticles. one's in focus, but the other one isn't."
"oh, it's kind of - bunch of high clouds - cirrus, i guess, - but it's down around 35, i'd say, and and pretty windy. so it's nippy when you're outside."
"okay. pane] 229: cb timer, main a, c]osed."
"jim, i didn't copy that. your c0_4 is pretty good, though. how is it with us?"
"oh, you wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. you've got to sort of bias it to the right."
"15, houston. we didn't see any obvious glitches down here, but we're going to go back and look at the data. --_-"
roger.
"okay. i am going to go ahead and thrust then. triangle difference is 0.01, but it's sort of difficult at three-tenths rate. i'm required to use medium speed unresolved, and it's difficult to hold the star centered long enough to get a decent mark on it."
"they want the lunar bat on your bus, charlie. okay, go."
roger.
"at 275:10, add ""charge bat a."""
pointed down pretty good.
"i saidthat you can walk more slowly than you started out, anyway. lmp-e_'a bob, texturially, some of these rock that i believe - gabbros - have a texture not unlike a - a welded tuff. but i don't think - i know they're not. but they've got some mottled characteristic to them that i haven't yet figured out."
then when you get a change - -
okay ...
okay; i got that.
come way on back here.
"hank, you say you want the mapping camera image motion, on; and then the cameras on ..."
"yeah, i know. i'm - i'm using that .... turned it over."
gzlybody ws_nt any 50 28? 03 16 15 16 cml> yes. get that?
"hello, houston; america."
"yeah. let's turn the heaters off, okay?"
it was good enough for us to understand you.
"okay, al. we got everything except the item after the burn time."
and to ejs d.
"yeah, well - i cheated a little bit there, and we didn't really have an awful lot to do while we were just spinning around. and some of those low revs came up with some very interesting observa- tions. in particular, the one that strikes me most vividly is the fact that - if you remember all of those apparent lineations we saw in silver spur in the places around hadley in the pictures. those same kind of things appear all over the sur- face of the moon down iow. it's just everywhere i look in the area where there's any topographical relief. they go in all different directions. i haven't been able to sort out if there's some preferred direction or some reason for it. what - what i did happen to notice as i came across theophilus on one of those passes was that you see this in the walls of theophilus - that's on the interior - and in the places where there are craters around the outside or some kind of - looks like some fracture or something of that nature that goes across theophilus or into it. you see what looks like a reflection in that these patterns - if you had a crater on the rim - these patterns would sorta show up like you would expect from a shock pattern. they would be radial and concentric to that crater. and these little lines seem to take that kind of a twist and then the fact that some of them go along with topographic highs. i'll see if i can get some photos. i didn't take any photos on this stuff because i didn't have a chance, but i looked out and saw some of these things, and they're _ust everywhere."
"they'll have to give you ac again and you punch in your breaker -well, let's see - i've still got hp on for the fdis, so you're in business now. all you need is the lamp breaker, the ac bus a aot lamp breaker, that is."
"that's why we're doing them to begin with. because people are worried about that, i guess. 111 01 20 19 lmp well, i wonder if we're the same distance on the trajectory as we were when we did it on the way out?"
"... 2, 3, 4 ... okay, now, in a minute, we're gonna - -"
"okay, three more flight plan updates, jim, if you're ready."
"you know, i really didn't concentrate too much on - on sulpicius gallus at that - that particular passing, i was concentrating on the tacquet area, and in that - in that case, all of the - the rilles and the ridges - not the wrinkled ridges out in the middle out in there, but the rilles and the area built up around the rilles and also associated maybe - oh, i was going to say 10 times the will - the rilles width is all one color."
"... beat up inclusion of some sort. oh, there's a nice piece coming out. oh, wait a minute - don't lose it. i2wp-eva i got it. i got it. ' cdr-eva got it."
"over here, where the ... is."
tie them down there on the couch some way?
yes.
"okay, aquarius. we're seeing some extremely low rates at this time, really below our capability to measure them."
"okay, that - that's probably bowen there, don't you think?"
... a1 ... how about yours?
"okay, houston. houston, how do you read on the steerable?"
roger. that should be good now.
okay.

i've gone through b.5 now - 3.4 really.
okay.

"what, charlie? 06 01 28 04 i_p-eva i was going to say take a - take a picture of that. this gnomon is worthless. it's against the stops."
yes?
"i never thought i'd be out here doing this. i_p-eva boy, i'll tell you, geno - okay, i'm going to go back this way. central station can be near a crater. it will be pretty good, that'll put the lean right out over there, which is probably all right. the graviometer out over there, which is probably all right. going to put your drill holes a little too close to that rock, though. bob, ask mark if he's worried about rocks as much as craters."
"you got them there, didn't you? ..."
"turn up your a - anun/numerics, john, so we can see this thing."
okay.

okay. fine.
"houston, 16."

roger.
"yes, and i got mine, too."
"yes, there is."
"i_sain't locked up, john."
"okay, ken, we read 25 miles."
roger that. i read you a bit better now.
"now, just pull it out and - and let it - and leave it go."
"(laughter) yeah - yeah. john says sock some water to me, and i just get the breaker, and he says that's enough every time. man, it really freezes you. you can't take it any - any long length of time; you just have to turn it on to get your suit all cooled down in about l0 seconds and shut it back off again."
okay (laughter).
"- - ... five. okay, at 40 minutes - okay. i got the high gain, off. got my finger on the data ·systems. okay. data systems are going off; operate at 49:35. operate. 54:38. give me a call on that, gordo. i'm going to look out the window here for a bit."
how many frames in the next nikon mag do i have to diddle with?

okay. waste water's down to about 20.

"okay. how much time have we got, houston?"
"okay, houston. i'm looking at oxidizer pressure just about 210. we're going to leave the valves in auto."
yes.
mark it.
get your purge valve out and then i'll ... 02.
the mylar and the gold coating on the inside of the shroud that's now visible is also intact. it looks like you could use it again if you could get it back.
"okay, that's - whoa! right there. 05 05 52.32 lmp-eva if we can get it off out here, the less we're going to have to put up with in there."
"i had to. now, let me just get through this right."
houston confirms. leave it open.
that's affirmative.
"okay. okay, jim, lights up."
"okay, i'll start pressing on it."
"okay, give it to me."
i didn't get the chance to check the det.

jack.
"okays if you can tilt it just u[:slightly, al, that'll be it. that' s good. you got good azimuth on it, now."
"yes. i'll get it. i don't know what this little thing is here, ..."
there we go. we got it now.
"say, on magazine oscar oscar, did we get enough of our required photos out of that, or are the rest of those - opportunity or not?"
"okay. on the 226 circuit breakers that i read up, they are - there are six circuit breakers involved and they're ail - they're the first six from the left on the bottom row of the panel. they're under lighting. we want the three flood circuit breakers out and the three numeric/ integral circuit breakers - i don't mean out, i mean closed. those six closed and the rest open. over."
okay. we've observed something there. stand by.

yes. there's the - i'm on the antenna.
that was painless enough.
"yes. how do you do that, al?"
okay.
okay.
okay. let's see what we're in.
okay.
i guess. re says it's down in the mud; it's less than 2 amps.
"okay. and the po_,[er is coming off the pan camera -"
"houston, houston, apollo 13. over."

okay. good show. and your - -
"11, houston. that's a good view of the eight ball. we see - you can even read the off fla_, there."
"roger. roger. it'll come up here in a moment. it looks good to us, jim."
"yes, it sure does. it sure does, and i can see underneath the upslope side; whereas, on the down- slope side, it's piled up. boy, that is really something."
"well, if he can get it through that tracking light. 05 23 i0 54 i6_ oh, the tracking light's off."
"watch it - i'm afraid. jack, it's stable enough. why don't you get out of the way? i'm afraid if i leave go of this thing, you'll get it in the head. lmi°-eva okay. have at it. he's still getting a centimeter a whack, poor guy. let's see. i didn't get a locator, i better get a locator. oh, it's in the - no, it isn't. 05 23 01 05 cdr-eva' the only thing i question is our ability to get it out. man, that's really hit bottom. i_-eva has it?"

okay.
"houston, the integration should all be done."

"okay. we'd like you to take it off and put it on the minus - y strut, in the shade."
"i get it - no, i get it, babe. it's in there. lnp-eva okay."
"the up - the update on the ordeal ball was a good one. at the burn, we were about - just about 8 degrees. we had to pitch down. the yaw was right on all the way through the entire burn, and just towards the end of the burn, the ball started going black in pitch a little bit."
"because it's - everything's stiekypoo. i got 32 marks, it ought to be, if this thing's ever going to do anything ..."
"fan, off."
okay. i - i got my attitude.
"okay, that's where we are right now."
"okay, there's about 25 grams."
i should have put in a 3 and really zapped it around.
"roger, joe. that's - that's a good analysis. we took mag charlie and tried to run it with our fin- gers and it won't run. it's absolutely jammed right in the beginning. and we'll run the others through tonight to make sure they'll work."
"okay. hey, we've got a tv picturel"
"2, mark -"
"no, that's okay."
okay.
watch that - watch that handle.
"apollo ll, houston. would you give us po0 in accept? we've got a refsmmat for you. over."
"they're checking. that'll do it, ken. five de- grees will cover the low-order bits."
huh?
... jumps so the lakers will want you when you get back.
"it'll take them awhile to cue it up, and maybe we'll work on that. let me give you guys a few items here while you're thinking. number 1, the old weather report: 2000 scattered - high scat- tered - 10 miles visibility, 3-foot seas, winds are out of the east at 10 knots. just about exactly what you had yesterday, and probably what we've been telling you for 2 or 3 days. looks like we're going to have a mideourse 7 this morning, about 2 feet per second. pretty much just to really center us in the corridor. we're already within the corridor now, with no problems. we're going to exit ptc at a different roll angle. we'll read that up to you later when you get the flight plan out; but just so you don't go ahead and exit early, we will be sending you something up on that exit ptc to new roll angle. and as far as the levas are concerned, you guys were looking for a place to stow those last night, and what we're suggesting is putting them in the sleep restraint on top of a-8 where you've got one suit stowed, apparently. and we're suggesting you put one of those on the helmet on that pga. and the other one, as it were, loose and in the bag. over."
"hey, jerry, have the boys check the - the - speed setting on that one. that was a pretty bright target. and i put the film on 1/60th; i think it ought to be about 1/125th. will you check them on that?"
roger. ready to copy.
"0kay, there's 3g's."
"well, it wasn't in here then."
"okay, that's fine. let's just 1 - as long as it's off the case."
you want me to put you on the surface?
"here's the wtb, you hear? i don't want to throw it. the cameras are in there."
"very good, houston. 58.8 - 9.5 and we're stay. thank you."
"okay, houston. endeavour with a burn status report."
"here's a nice sharp little hole; look at that. bob, the texture of the light mantle - surface texture - is really no different on the scarp, on its flank, or out here to the east of the scarp. fragment population, crater population, everything looking about the same. if there is such a thing as a light mantle, it seems to be uniform across the scarp."
"no, i sure don't."
"okay, on the left, make sure that the - -"
roger. we'll do that.

"cabin repress, close."
beautiful.
yes.
"remember, we pulled the cameras out ... and put them in the jett bag."
"well, i've sort of lost track. but i had a good sleep."
"- - have the tape out there, from the sound of things, maybe you'd better put some of it in your pocket for later."

"okay. we're reading you, houston."
"okay, houstou. a1 is finished with the documenta- tion. counter, 110."
"yes - we'll get them to do that next time. but look at the rover tracks; i'm going to take some pictures of the rover tracks here. and our boots - our boot prints, both. look at the difference. that old rover is light."
i'm getting good cooling. i can feel it.
... getting ...? 08 04 02 12 _ christ!
i'm thinking about it.
"let's see, we're not - we're coming up 6 min- utes - what we got to do is get the cameras - get the tv camera out next. we're about fixed."

"houston, 16. over."
"and proceeding on. if, during the burn, the engine stops, if you have a flashing noun 97, you should proceed, then ullage, engine start to push, and descent engine override on. okay. now just general information. if you didn't burn pc plus 2, probably p - p plus 4 would be the earliest mcc. ags is going to backup in a rate-fail mode only, which you know. we're talking over the star check. will have to get back with you on that. if, for some reason, there is no pc-2, you have a free-return tra- jectory with the landing at 152:02:00, and that would be after a small midcourse-5, which would probably be around 4 feet per second at 93 hours. and you have recovery forces in the indian ocean; you're in good shape there. and the indian ocean is where this landing would be. okay. you still with me?"
"huh? yeah, i'm trying ... (laughter)."
that's correct for eagle and command module.
"okay, tony. we'll proceed. thank you."
"i'll give them to you now; anything for you. okay; we used stars 25 and 26. noun 05 was four balls l, torquing angles were plus 00022, minus 00032, plus 00038, and they were torqued out at 95:43:00."
you have a bearing of 234 and a range of 2.1.
"okay, jack. roger."
"okay. if we don't have a midcourse-3, then we'll probably move lm fam up to 55 hours, in which case we'll go in there and read she tank pressure."
"okay, out valve, close."
okay. let's do an enter on that.
"front drive is on bus a and - yeah, i changed that back a while back."
yes.
"*** 0, plus 2, minus 6."
"going further down to 114:16, cross out the ""14 dac 18 vhbw limb brightening"" line and the line under that which is ""brkt, mir,"" et cetera."

okay. i'll give you a hack at 88 hours. that'll ! be another 25 minutes.
"okay, it's unlatched."
"okay. on panel 225, we want the rendezvous transponder flight bus circuit breaker open, and the s-band _n transmitter/dse flight bus circuit breaker open. over."
"okay, roll right 63 degrees. roll will be 064."

okay. just walk around for 1 second.
"go ahead, orion."
our 19:16.
"okay, houston. you should have the data now, according to our checklist."
hold the top.
?ztch 2. 03 04 53 32 i_mp yc:uhave it.
"okay. and, a1 and ed, this is a grab sample at b, and we need the panorama. and while someone is doing that, we can get our site description. 05 12 3h 20 cdr i'll get a pan, then. 05 12 34 21 lm_ okay. and while a1 takes the _:an, i'll go ahead and give you a site description. the area here is an area of considerably more boulders, a larger boulder field, more numerous boulders than we've seen in the past. we've just come into it as we - as we approached b from a. now, there are - _here were boulders to the north of us; we previously talked of boulders to the north; and, doggone it, they may turn out to be a ray pattern. it i©_ks suspiciously like - like one. however, where we are now, we're about on the edge of a genera] boulder population lining the flank of cone crater. now, they're not too numerous at this poina. they're somewhat patchy. there's a lot of tham buried, half buried, a few of the smaller ones sitting oa the surface. there are - these boulders are fiiletei, and we'll have to sample that filleting later. the surface texture - the fine is very much - appears very much the same as what we've been walking on all along. and about the only difference we can see is probably a larger number of smaller craters, i say probably; they're so numerous, unless you really make a population count, you can't tell. a large - i'm guessing, a larger number sf craters - _rohably secondaries from cone, perhaps- and certainly a larger number of boulders lying around. now, most of these boulders are rounded; there are a few angular ones; there are a few rocks with angulars but - angularities - but, by and large, you can see edges that have been chipped off, indicating the beginning of a smoothing process. and some of thegn are far beyond the beginning of smoothing. they're - they're worn down pretty well and most of the rough edges are where they have frastured aha per- haps turned over. most of them appear to be along fractures of where other rocks are sitting near them that might have once been a part of _hat boul- der. out. confidentiaty"
i -
"oh, i forgot to take pictures again. trying to shade my eyes. that scarp certainly is spectacular gcing up there by hanover, isn't it?"
okay.
"okay ... 03 10 11 22 lm_ yes, 38:30. set it on - set it on 15 minutes, or 114minutes - 38."

"obviously, what we're thinking about here is a bad _ hatch seal, so we're particularly interested in that."
"the ... coming up. let's just put these in here, just in the right place. yeah, let me get moved up. we got an eat period in there. i'll change my sensors during the eat period .... or something. somewhere in here, we got to get - the cockpit ... set up for lunar orbit. 02 21 47 4g lmp yeah."
okay. that shows we get a 59 by 9.
they were all over his ass during that eva. he was just really humping. that poor fellow - i bet he's exhausted.
"roger, fred. thank you."
"do you want to see any shots down in the leb, vance? o1 06 55 b1 cc say again."
good. i'd never believe that this ... could be so nice.
going off the comm.
... fit there is long ways.
"from here bob, they're both very dark -"
ail right.
"okay, dave. and buckle up for safety here."
"okay, jack, landing radar breaker is in, and i've got altitude and velocity transmitter. that's good start. eighty degrees. that's okay. cross pointer's high mult. you reading me all right?"
"15, this is houston. how do you read?"
"okay. at 57:50, ""csm proceed with ptc activation."""
hold the glove. 04 23 31 51 _ *** you're not in engage position.
"not bad. did real well, dave."
(chuckle) how your comrades doing?
...
"all right. oh, that's right. okay. i think that's right. okay. i'm about to give you your number. oh, darn it. (laughter) crank it a couple of times. clean as a whistle. clean as a whistle."
you don't want to do that.
"okay, i'm reading 8.6."
"okay, if you'll do that, i'll get one of these marks in i've heard so much about."
"..., dave."
"okay, and the other thing we'd like to keep you aware of, if you hadn't noticed it, and that is that this thing, of course, ron, is originally ... to a 196:30 plus, which means that you're going to be running 198:30 plus, which kind of looks like you're going to be eating at least a half an hour into your sleep period, at the very least. over."
"what it looks like is a - a buried rock, not unlike the others around here, except it appears to have some sort of coating on it that's very iridescent. a lot of crystals shining in it - -"

i hope so.
affirmative.
there's a recent hit.
"hank, it still looks to me like i'm pointing closer to spica than i am to antares."
roger. going po0 in accept. (columbia)
okay.
okay.
"yes, sir. and, dave, a comment - -"
... i've got - i've only got 19 frames left so -
"shutdown, 5 plus 51. okay. cameras - -"
okay. move back a tad. 04 23 50 37 lm_ yes. *** there you go.
"ok_, i'll take a pan from here."
"okay. 06 01 44 48 ii,p-eva it's captured in the old tongs. was captured in the old ton_s."
good. let's see if it goes the other way. 03 12 06 _0 cc these guys down here are saying they knew it ail the time.
"okay, reset - now."
right here.
"okay. incidentally, the white rocks you see there. do they look like the - the cone crater type white rocks?"
there's a double one.
"i still have the power on it, hank. i've got it in standby and power on."
"okay. 06 14 44 53 i24p boresight sextant star check, we've got that. okay, p40."
it may be two small boulders.
okay - -
"yeah. yeah_ i'm starting in the right position. i've got f/6, 1/25, at 74. and i'll do a partial pan with each film - with each setting. it's going to be about ar eight-picture pan."
"okay, jack. on mdc l, there's nothing abnormal. all the rate indicators are zero. ball number 2 is frozen, of course; we lost main b. i've got - ball number i appears to be working normally. right now i'm sitting at roll 0, pitch 180, and yaw about 13 degrees. i'm going to try and hold 0, 180, and 0."
fantastic.
i'll see. i'll see.
"roger: you got a beauty there, john."
"oh, i don't really think there's any future in that."
...
"okay, jack."
"okay. copy that, geno."
"that's correct. and the next thil_/{you will do will be to set the mission timer and what we've done is to only turn on the missis],,ti::':' on the ml)c. and you'll probably have to wai_ here until they get through with the uplink sc y_-i ._:'_:'_ have the computer."
"okay, don't worry about it too much, guys; i'm sure the bag will stay on without the hook."
okay. is that music we hear in the background?
"yeah, but charlie, we can't - we can't get off the samples around - -"
"okay. i guess the thing that seems to me like it might be missing here is where you're gonna get - well, you've got me setting my dse to high bit rate over here at 153. i guess we'll get some of that, won't we? because we - we've had it running with no dump - -"
trade places with you. i need to go over -
okay.
"- - and you're cleared to turn it on. 04 ]2 45 23 cmp okay, and the gamma ray boom is going out now. f- 04 12 45 33 cc okay."
"apollo 15, houston, reac_ and narrow. over."
25.
okay.
"yes, i'm here. i'm going to get a partial pan, bob."
can you get that?
a bagful. 06 02 03 37 cdr-eav we got a whole bagful of those in the comps. and that's in 172.
"roger, ken. we've got about a minute until los. i was just telling you."

"to go to my inertial ball, i'm on orb rate, now. that may have been why nell and those guys got gimbal lock, although i ..."
"okay. i can see one, two, three distinct layers and it looks like several stre_m_ of material that go from the interior of south ray over to - one of them points out, goes in south ray and over the lip and down the outside. and it points over to- wards baby ray. and i'm trying to look at the material - all those things we said we could see, all those lineaments and things that we looked at back in the furrow of descartes just don't show, hank."
"okay. ""p52 option 3."""
sure thing.
down below - - -
"copy that, jack. we can see that."
"lock, locked and verify lo. lo? okay."
okay. you want me to go back to original attitude. i'll be going back to it now.
"i've got to go 0.7 - about another 0.7 mi - kilometers. i may be coming up on the edge of it. i don't know, i may - i'm on the right bearing. yes. we're all right. steno has got a dimple on the north. boy, this is a heck of a way to start out our navigation because it's into the cross-sun here - not cross-sun - but sun. now, that's got to be powell, wouldn't you say?"
there it isl proceeded.
"i'll get in the ... while you guys can get in the picture, okay?"
"okay, dave. out of curiosity, did you photograph the lm with the big camera?"
"tranquility, houston. we'd like you to recall p57 and run through the gravity align one more time. over."
what about these lights up here? 02 i0 41 30 lmp i've got it.
and notice the disclaimer.
sir? okay. here's the flight plan. we're doing what we're supposed to be doing for a change.
"al, this is houston. you can terminate the dump now. and turn the alpha particle experiment off, please."
okay; and let me - we'll have one more recommen- dation for you.
"okay, ron. and for jack, the surgeon says he's getting occasional erratic trace from jack's biomed. he would be happy if jack wants to take it clear off. l_ gordy, i don't know how to tell you this, but i haven't had my biomed on for about 6 hours."
roger.
and then i'll offer to get the tv.
okay. understand.
"that looks pretty good, geno."
"and, falcon; houston. you're go for an aps tpi. you have 180 feet available. 07 0b 55 48 cdr-lm oh, roger. understand. go for the aps tpi, thank you. 07 0b 56 38 cmp falcon, endeavour. you got your lights on, jim?"
"did you get some of that in your rover sample? t_mp-eva no, but i got it out of that instant rock crater."
okay. oh. how's the cabin pressure?
"- - about - maybe 50 meters - okay, and on the south - i can just barely see the - west slope - western slope of earthlight. but the southern slope of it, i can also see, has several blocks on it."
okay. 07 02 43 _2 lmp-eva here's the rock. i'll get the camera for you. and i guess i'll go on back and take the brush. okay?
"okay. about 0.3. okay. there's my h20 full - flag. *** that case, let me see if i can't get the - oh, man. it's unlocked, huh? 4-16 _ _ : ..'__1_1___ day 6"
"intercom, t/r."
... at 133:01.
okay. why don't you try and manually point it - try and level it and see if we - see what you can do toward getting it towards the earth.
that's the last time we want to have to - open that.
"i'm ready for them, jack."
okay.
"okay. we copy that, gene, and are the boulder tracks - -"
barber pole and gray.
"okay, the old mapper is going off."
"no, i don't want to do that. okay,"
"yes, that's it right there. _mp-eva let me set my working tool down here."
roger.
"pga diverter valve, vertical."
and my meal yesterday was the meal b in the pocket.
okay. we got only y.
huh?
"that's affirmative, sir. it's just that we don't need to do the water dump, that's all."
"very nice, ken. beautiful color."
okay.
"okay. photo small box f:8, 5, one."
"america, houston. the sun is just about to enter the lens of the mapping camera, and we'd like you to retract it and then close the cover. we're not copying sim bay data now, so we'd like you to get a mark on both the start of retraction - give a mark on the start of retraction and one when barber pole goes to gray."
roger. both - -
"john says in order to catch up with the clock sync, you're making us eat day 10, meal b, and the task is overwhelming."
okay. once - once you get the aos ball alined ... command module ...
l's off.
that's 80 millimeter ... up there. 08 23 58 l0 _ no .... i gave it to you.
it will be -
"okay. and now, after you drive the optics to 90 degrees, we want to delete the optics power, off. and we want to verify optics speed, lo. and we're going to leave the optics power on and, here in the mysterious world of glitches, this is going to minimize the probability. so we're gonna come in with it on, and we'll put the speed to lo just to hold down the drift."
yes sir. going right there.
"no, the other way."
"no, we don't get it."
roger. and we'll give you the word when we're ready for that.
"i can bag it for you, geno."
pitchover.
okay.
"ugh. come open, you son of a gun."
"and, houston, i noticed through the aot and l'a_c 509 through the overhead docking window that we are venting again."
an_hing fall out?
okay.
...
"okay, manual on the boresight."
okay. reset.
"the crater here that i'm standing by, joe, it's about a meter in diameter. and then, there's a smaller crater right in the center of it, and that one has fragments around it that - that have glass exposed on them, where the - the larger crater does not have any glass exposed. just the smaller crater within the large one."
"okay, we want al, though, to be in position to watch it."
"rover looks in good shape, so far."
okay. 05 05 15 10 i_-eva and it packs easier that way.
"okay, i'm headed - i'm headed - i'm headed 182, 346, 1.2, 1.1, ll0, 108, 100, and ll8, and off scale low on all of the bo - motors."
"looks like there's some pretty good football games coming up this weekend, too."
and 3-a is reading 4.0.
"i think so, except as gene pointed out, the clasts were coarser. they were coarser in the bottom than about anything we saw in the rim."
...?
okay; mapping camera is standby - 01 20 03 51 lm_ mark it.
"hey, there's a pretty sharp one right there. it's - not that - not big enough though."
good show. what is your get now?
"read you the same. okay. plss mode, both of them, ar."
i don't know.
"yes, go ahead."
"probably kicking the hell out of you down there,"
"yeah, let's look at that one. hold off here ..."
good show. another first for 16.
"no. that's over there on the rim, isn't it?"
"and, before you - you test that particular circuit breaker, just make sure that the group 5 circuit breakers are open, and we won't be risking anything by testing it. now finally, after this note, we've got several deletions, and i'll continue on here. delete ""ullage and thrust, on""; delete ""sps thrust light, on""; delete ""delta-v thrust, b""; delete ""ullage and thrust, on""; delete ""monitor thrusting pc 95 to 105, ems counting down."""

"joe, this is - it's a tan, fine-grained crystalline rock. i've got to say that, because it's got - up to 2-millimeter laths of plage in it randomly or- iented. and the matrix is a sort of light gray to tan. it's a very well - indurated rock. on the outside, i've got nice glass-filled tip, and some other pits in it. it's sure solid and - sure looks crystalline. it's a beauty. it came from this large block over here at 275."
is it on top of a little dome?
"stand by, pete."
"yes, indeed, karl; sure would. 03 lb 22 12 cc okay; we'll get one together. _' 03 13 22 14 cmp yes, listen. skip it tomorrow; and, maybe day after tomorrow, we'll get a summary on that. i'll be kind of interested in how goes it myself."
houston. roger. out.

okay; i'll get it.
"how many films did we take with this? seven, huh?"
roger.
"okay, orion, we have hi bit rate, and we don't see anything out of the ordinary right now. 05 07 21 47 lmp-l_ okay. thank you."
okay. lm power's off.
"well, i still am, as a matter of fact. _e old earth's coming by. and, say, i mentioned a couple of fronts that joined together about 20 degrees south of - of - the south coast of australia. and it looks like that's a fairly healthy storm center developing down in there - conceivably may migrate up across tasmania and maybe up - up the sydney- brisbane coastal area in the next few days."
okay.
"- - to the president, and i'd like to thank you too for the support we've had."

"and, you know, the terrain, looking from the east here - the - is just a general rise to the east. it looks like, oh, 2 - 2 or 3 percent. notice that, dave?"
yes.
"oh, that's all right."
"okay. looks good, gene. thank you."
"okay. panel power off, suit power off and audio control normal. got it? coh_rol normal. okay. panel 604, geno, is suit pressure alarm off, verify."

"yes, i want to see us a little more level."
okay. how's that?
"and steering forward is now in bus charlie, and i cycled it three times."
"tony, we'll give you an analogy of what that black and white rock looks like. it's really a gray and white and looks like a granitic rock with vel_ large crystals to it, though i kind of doubt that."
"roger, bob."
"okay, jack. yo_ can get _o_r 02 on."
"hey, is it okay if i turn you around to dust the snow out of your eyes, there?"
why don't you hand me your seatbelt?
you think - you think that'll stop the dust that way?
"did you copy that, tony? my question?"
yes. okay.
roger. we'll pass it on to metro. (gos_ net 1) tape 21/2
it broke in two in my hand.
"that's correct, and, also on that page, -;ou - from our last correct - or addition exercise, you have a section ca21ed ""reestablish ptc."" we'd like to scratch all of that, of course. 05 09 22 22 lmt' roger. 05 09 ;_246 cc okay, fred. that's all except for one comment that we have, and - just a s_,_cond."

"boy, they sure make them tight. okay ...."
"13, houston. by the way, we'd like to know how the high gain antenna lockup worked. our signal strength is a little bit lower than we thought it would be."
(laughter) was that consoliaa_ea jackpot?
roger. don't use your glove or dust brush there.
yes. just stand by.

"okay, jack, i'm on the way."
where's this -
"no, we aren't. we're okay."
you charging battery b?
okay.
"0ksv. all right, panel eva 02, on. let me verify those locks again."

okay.
"bob, okay. and you want to hear something?"
okay.
"sorry you thought i was helping you, but i wasn't."
"mafk. right eye, dot, center. the left eye was a stzeak starting in the center going out to the right. it increased in size as it went from right to left."
"go ahead, houston. hadley here."
yes.
okay.
see that one right there - by the rake?
"and, endeavour, we're about 40 seconds from los; see you on the other side."
"vhf b xmtr, off."
"okay, america_ we're back with you."
okay. which way?
we're making it get smaller and smaller here to make sure that it really is the one w_'re leaving.
"go ahead, houston."
"there it goes, bob."

on the time line where we - the p52 you just did. back over here.
roger.
"okay, my lights are out. 72, varying, pro."
"well, we're running out of bags, aren't we?"
okay.

can you get to the isa.
and this - this is the one that got - this that we cut out yesterday. you know?
"well, all - all i could do was stick it in the window and catch - catch the rille going out of the edge of the picture, and that was it, dave. so, all i saw was - all i saw was st. george and - and elbow crater."
"hello, houston. you read apollo 127 out of blackout. l0 o4 27 o8 cc ..."
good show. did you drink any water when you got back in - -
here we go.
"okay, joe. why, we have no further questions. we think we can run through that one okay."
does that make sense? (laughter)
"okay, houston. that's - okay. it looks like i might have hit the yaw knob on the steerable with the plss."
"columbia, houston. you can go ahead an_ go to heacq in the high gain. we should get you then."
"man, this has been a trip."
okay. stay where you are.
"i said, on that first uv sequence we had, we did go free."
you're mode ii. 03 11 26 57 cml° loose rules now?
okay. the first one is a p76 for the csm circ. l_p go.
"you - you have to raise your right side up and go to your left. it would be the best thing you could do. that's it. keep coming. up and left, up with the right and over to your left. that a boy. good show. 06 05 24 37 lmp-_ there we go. 06 05 24 38 cdr-i_m yes, you're clear."
"yes, pete. okay."
is that a fact?
...
"and we're not going to have a number - - any calls here for a good 40 minutes, so this is a good time to catch up on your meal regimen there if you want, ron."
"for a 10-minute stop, dave, i don't think the rake is - -"
"and we were pointing right at november at the time. so, index is over there on the right. ___ 06 02 59 30 i_p-eva (laughter) making me seasick."
roger.
"pete, you've been out 1 hour and 2 minutes, and you're both running about 2 minutes off nominal, behind."
okay.
"in other words, it ain't good - it ain't good science. 09 21 h3 35 cc yeah, john. i think - i think you're right on, and i hope they heard you in the backroom, because i - i think i said the same thing this morning."
yeah.
"release. we didn't go very far. (laughter) okay. we'll let it sit here for a second. okay, we're going to back off, now."
"roger. page 5-6. _ 05 20 50 36 cdr-ln okay, i've got it."
"and now we want to ask you a question about alinements, and so forth. we wanted to know if you can see any stars out of the aot. we also wanted to know if you could use the service module to cast a shadow on the lm windows and then look out the windows to see stars for a ps1 coas alinement."
...
"okay. for today, we'd like you on p23 to make a trunnion bias determination, prior to p23 sightings as called out in procedures, and also one afterwards. our intent here is to check out the possibility that some sort of thermal effect may be giving you errors in the angular read-out in the sextant. the bias that you get beforehand should be incorporated, that is a proceed on noun 87 after you get two consecutive measure- ments equal to within 0.003 degrees. and, of course, move the trunnion off a couple of degrees between the measurements. the earth should be a lot smaller in your field of view today. i'm , sure you're a lot more qualified to tell us about that than we are, but to ensure that you're getting a good angle measurement between the star and the earth horizon, the sextant m-line, which is the line that runs through the two hash marks and is perpendicular to the r-line, should be parallel to the earth horizon at the substellar point. and then the actual super- imposition of the star upon the horizon can be made at any point in the field of view of the sextant: above, below, or on the m-line. we recommend the marks be made as rapidly as possible after auto maneuver. if you feel that the amount of time between the auto maneuver and the time you get ready to mark is excessive, or that you don't like that auto maneuver attitude when you get ready to mark, of course, you can use a verb 94 - verb 94 to get you back to the flashing 51 position to redo the auto maneuvers. over."
"well, i'm working mine. there's both."
roger; good show. are you saying that you didn't have any weather over that southern africa there?
"that - that's - the pallet, the pallet -"
roger. is there anything that looks like bare rock on them?
"here you go, john."
... an hour and a half.
ail that other?
okay. we mean battery 5 to off/reset. 05 08 46 30 limp okay.
"thank you, joe. i think you are more than a casual bystander though. 05 02 27 23 cdr-i_ hey, joe. we've got - i and b - or correction, l's replacing the 3s and 2's replacing the _s on the plss."

do you have a tone?
"orion, this is houston. i have the circ pad if you're ready to copy."
"okay, ken. we left off, i think, about 150 hours."
"it's connected and it's locked. okay, dave, to l - low."
where? straight ahead?
sounds good. and tell dave once again that you don't want any dust on your experiments. _.
"here i come, ready or not."

"what? yeah, i know it."
"all right, that's in work."
okay. i'll call captain video.
"okay, i've got a good handhold over here on the pan camera - this rail, so that's a good one, and now i'm over the gamma ray door and it's about open at, say, 30 degrees."
i never used the stop button. the window bars are set.
i meant pericynthion.
"ron, we'd like you to turn it off now."
okay.
look at my camera lens and see how dirty it is.
"do you have any tv, houston?"

"right now, this stuff, this - material around the spacecraft reminds me - in this sun angle, looking into the sun - a very rich brown color - it re- minds me of a good plowed field."
yes. you got a hole behind you now.
"roger, ed. discontinue the check and go _ead with your post-eva systems configuration. 04 22 38 06 _p okay."
"hey, you bet i'll take it - i want to try i_."
"okay. our data shows the platform's inertial now, ken."

"okay, 17, continuing on with the weather. it should be - get up to the upper 60s here in houston today. it was foggy when i came to work, but i understand the sun is out now and the fog is burned off. on the international-national scene: there's another reported snag in negotiations between dr. henry kissinger and north vietnam's le duc tho. the two have discussed the peace terms since mon- day; but, so far, little news concerning the talks has been released by either side. they meet again today. a judge in the pentagon papers trial of daniel ellsburg has declared a mistrial. judge matt burn has asked that a new jury be selected. both sides in the cases must now go back to the beginning and prepare their arguments again. former president harry truman is still hospitalized with a serious heart condition. although listed in critical condition, the 88-year-old former chief executive has shown some improvement, accord- ing to his daughter, margaret truman daniel. president nixon has completed selection of his new cabinet by announcing that he will keep richard kleindienst as attorney general. there will be a number of major changes, though, in upper levels of the justice and interior departments. life magazine will be no more as of the end of december. the pictorial magazine lost over 30 million dollars during the past 4 years. no doubt some of the final pictures to appear in the famous 36-year-old publication will be those of the apollo 17 mission. an airliner crashed at midway airport in chicago, friday. of the 61 persons aboard, only 18 survived tape41/4 the crash. in other national and international highlights: unemployment figures show a drop to the lowest level in 2 years; 5.6 billion dollars has been released by the federal government in the first revenue-sharing payment to the state and local governments; and the nato foreign min- isters have urged the soviet union to cut down troop strength and allow freer movement of people o_er the east-west borders. in local and regional news: new hijack control devices have been in- stalled at houston intercontinental airport. the new metal detectors are being installed in many air- ports around the united states. new inspection procedures will also begin in january - of all hand luggage carried aboard airliners. and on the sports page: a1 conover is not going to re- turn to wake forest as rumored. the rice coach has met with university president dr. norman haekermau to discuss a firm 5-year contract agree- ment. professional football highlights today's sports; the ""over-the-hill-gang"" from washington with billy kilmer and larry brown will take on the dallas cowboys at texas stadium in irving. the cowboys will, no doubt, go with craig morton at quarterback. dallas can ensure itself of a ""wild card"" slot in the playoffs with the redskins, if they win. for dallas, it's a revenge game. the skins have won nine straight."
"yes, it did. i noticed the quantity light also. i was thinking reg light, though, when i saw it. oh, man."
"and turn on your zoom. just to show that a good postal service takes care of the mail just about any place in the universe, i have the pleasant task to cancel the - i'll wait till you get around here. you've got a slow tv today. meantime -"
"okay. let me write that down. figuring it says low, and you want me to go high. okay; and if you'd remind me of that just before los."
"okay, and we are finished with the uv photos."
"hey, pete, your out-of-plane is plus 1.8 feet per second."

"yes, we're okay. ail we've got is a switch to throw on this lm power. okay. after the suit, next thing we've got is a switch to throw, and i can do that. that's 13 minutes from now. and the next thing after that - what's that?"
are we cleared to proceed? over.
that was 23046.

that's it.
okay. this is a - this is a crowded fellow up here.

...
"and, 15, be advised that this is the last retract we'll do. we will not do the fifth retract in order to ensure that we don't damage the filament by getting it in too close. we'll sit in this retracted position for 30 minutes, and then de- ploy the mass spec boom as per the flight plan at 249: 30. over."
i don't see it.
"now, if i can get it out. okay, i'm going back to - the lm."
"okay, what do you do after that?"
we never saw anything that resembled a transient vent. that's what dick thinks.
oh.
"thrust, off; automatic."
okay. real good.
"man, you can get a bunch of stuff with this rake. see s if this was - if this was from south ray - -"

"okay, water and glycol tanks pressure and relief valve to both."
"okay, the shield is on."
"understand. the cmp does not have the tone, again?"
"apparently, it - it didn't do too much for them, but what it did do was convince them that it's probably somehow locked up because its tempera- ture's not right yet. and they're not worrying about whether it's level or not level now. they're - they're confident that it's been set up okay, and now they're just biding their time to bring that temperature up. we'll get some more words to you sometime tomorrow on it as you make your tradi- tional visit to the site again - alsep site again, probably. how are you coming along with your sleep prep?"
"houston, 15. still in the midst of doing a little house cleaning."
"- - angles you gave us, vance, aren't correlating the verb 49 numbers."
it's going to get smaller before it gets larger.
"and, gordo, for information, that's not unique; we're all having that, and taking them off is the best relief for it."
all righty.

"that a boy. push the ... button ...... , dick. l--"
"but - one of - one of the things, i was just sitting here looking at the equipment and some of the things that have caused more interest than others in what we were doing. and - one of the things that is at the heart of a lot of your time in this spacecraft is fixing something to eat. now, i'm - without discussing whether or not you need to eat this much, just the idea that if you try to eat part of it, it takes an awful long time to fix each of these things. and one of the big hangups is we all get clustered around the water gun. we've talked about gas coming out of the water gun, and this is not the drink port, but the food-preparation station. and the - if you - one of the ways we found we could induce gas bubbles into the waker was b2fderress- lng the plunger before it had had a chance to com- plete 'its stroke. if you let it complete its stroke, it seems to give you a nice, relatively gas-free shot of water. and it looks like the hot water gives you more for an ounce than the cold water does. but if you're very meticulous about waiting until you're sure that the plunger has made its full travel, and then count to l0 or something before you push it again, the cold water isn't quite as short as it looks like it is. and i don't really know how to explain why we have gas bubbles sometimes and why we don't. it's almost as though the gas separator may not affect the problem. we started out and the first couple of days we didn't have any gas. i guess about 2 days. then on the third day, we started getting gas in the hot water and we were getting like 50 percent gas. we tried the cigar gas separator, and that - that - after we got it flushed out the first time, seemed to work pretty well. and then it started getting gas, so we decided to try the prototype model. then when we put it on the feed station - why, as soon as we put it on, why, we made a squirt and nothing came out, and we decided to try it again. and by then, it was obvious that it was building up pressure inside, and the food station was putting out water, and it wasn't coming out the other end. and we never did get water to come out the - the outlet side of the new gas separator. and it looks like it has a crack in the top on the inlet side, and the gas - the water was bubbling out of that. it was coming out under pressure. when we took the thing off, why, you could tell that the cheek valve or some- thing, had never been opened. so we really don't know whether that thing has arq effective use or not. and it - it seems like the more water you use, the more gas you get. i don't - i'm not sure i completely understand that. you get more gas in the hot water than you do in the cold water. but the water i've been getting out today and yesterday has been almost gasfree. i can spin it up here, and i won't get - i get a zone of less than l0 percent gas. and that's l0 percent of a 7-ounce food - juice bag. the other day we were getting 50 percent. and i really can't psych out exactly all the causes for it. the cigar food - cigar dispenser there has some problems of its own. and every time you get through with it, it dribbles. and it will dribble for quite a while. but i found out if you put the little cap on it right away, then it quits dribbling. and it's only that initial f_ dribble, and the rest of it from there on is easy. i really don't expect anything to be done with these comments. i just want to - we're supposed to evaluate these things, hank. and rather than write them down - it's a lot easier to put here, and i'll get it off the tape after the flight."

"okay. question. this short turnon step 3 on page 24 has us only turning on the rcs system a/b, two quads, and tbe breakers are still out on panel 11. did you want those in, too, or are we just going to use one set of heaters?"
"yes, we'd be better off if we operated two cameras. 06 20 12 52 i2qp yes, we got to set them up down here. because this way we can all - here's the problem. we're not - now, look at that, we never could get all that - p50 done in one run. you'll have one run of it, and then you'll run one through your camera, and you'll be aiming to shoot straight down; you can use the pso and pick up the other stuff - stuff on the left, of course. i'll try to get this stuff to right, of course, for the p50 ... 06 20 13 28 cml° i'll get it, ..."
"yes. and they were gone. 03 23 5_ 51 cdr did you get a good chance to point it at the apennines coming up, though?"

i don't think so.
that's beautiful.
"... yes. yes, with the polarizer. right."
roger. that'll replace the rake soil sample we were going to get. and we'd like you moving in b minutes.
"yep, sure do."
"hey, bob, while he's doing that, there's a real good example of pit-bottom crater up here even on this talus slope. i'll try to take a stereo of it."
"yeah, i'll just leave it here because that'll keep quiet in here."
okay.
you want a stereopair?

open and gray.
"okay. he's going to open the hatch and ivt. gordo, let me tell you a little more on that dock- ing latch. when i looked at it, of courses my handle was flush against the edge and it was also - essentially - locked in position. but since the bungee was down on the thing i took hold of it, and i felt that the hook itself was loose. 0kay_ so i took the handle and the handle will come back - would come back once you pressed the little button, you know, to release the handle. the handle would come back to about a 45-degree position just like it normally does when you try to cock the latches. okay, with the handle back in that 45-degree position, then i grabbed hold of the hook and brought the hook off of the dock- ing ring with my finger and back to about that 45-degree position again just like it was com- parable to the first cocked position. and that's the way it is right now."
"don't forget the gnomon, gene."
"terminator photos for the 250, they call out f/5.6 and 1/125th. and that's for the very-high-speed black and white. yes. you don't have any left though, do you? no. yes."

"we must be about 200 meters up the slope, looking at that little valley down there, jack. am i right?"
"(laughter) they've got to be kidding. yes. boy, anytime you put anything spring-loaded on the moon, you're in trouble (laughter). this screen has got sort of - you know - a spring to it?"

"okay, i'll sure do that. i'll come in and i'll whistle something here."
okay. we want you to close the cb(16) abort stage. over.
"well, i don't see a thing. i heard the sextant go."

i think so.
"well, if i could get ron off his - work with the optics, we'd look at the earth some more. but that will come. right now i'm seeing all sorts of little ice crystals of various composition, (laughter) that are moving around, and every one of them bounces off the lm that i can see. no, none of them stick. i noticed that some of them will go into a corner with a fairly high velocity and either be turned around by a double bounce, or just get lodged in the corner and have very low velocity when they come out."

"and, jack, let me know if you get close to gimbal lock, would you?"
"okay. and that's the end of that procedure. a note here that this assumes a - a good oxidizer transducer, and there may be a - a problem that it's hung up. and we'll have a - a little later change in the midcourse 2 burn procedure. and from this, we'll be able to tell what - what - where the problem is. i'll get that up to you as soon as they've sorted it out here. okay, and there are two notes here. for ken, a reminder to watch the uv film consumption magazine oscar oscar. he's right on the budget now, and there's no pad."

"those are real good comments, ron. i was in just talking with the experimenters, and if you've _ot nothing else to do, giving us some sizes of those cells would certainly be very beneficial."
"well, we're - we're - i'm sure fao will have some hers in a few minutes, but that's guaranteed all until you get back."

that makes for easy trench digging.
"go ahead, houston."

"that description - that description fits the geology up in there, because we weren't seeing blocky riww,_d craters and otherwise you would have been able to tell more easily about the old versus new craters, which would be the ones you could either go through or not go through, respectively."

"okay, well, i'd like to leave it - you know it's a little change in my thinking - i'd like to leave it on the rover if we can, although it's a piece of cake to take off. it's very difficult to lean over that bar without losing your balance and taking your - your readings and what have you. so if we can leave it on it would be far better."
"cb(16) ecs: suit fan 2, open."
... the s-ii sep light?
"okay. we're back to the dark horizon again, but we'll pitch her on down. on? okay. there you go. got everything up."
how did he get - -
"question number 6. do you feel that the workload during your three lunar-surface excursions was too demanding? you appeared at times to be reaching the limit of your endurance. any recommendations for apollo 167 ll 06 b1 24 cdr i think anytime you set out on a task such as the one we had, you're bound to, at certain times, get a little tired, which i think we probably did. however, i think we came back and i don't think we ever reached anywhere near the limit of our physical endurance. i think apollo 16 probably has everything in hand; it's just a matter of conditioning yourself. jim and i have discussed it since we got back onboard the endeavour and concluded that our training is what really pre- pared us, and the many hours we spent during geology field trips and in simulations at the cape in our suits, we feel, was the factor which really contributed to being able to proceed with those duration evas. i see no problem in the future with conducting three successive 7-hour evas. neither one of us were particularly physically tired. i think the fatigue is really in the - the mental regime, in which you're concentrating very intensely for 7 hours, and you're pressing to do your best all the way through and - and keep your eyes open to make the appropriate ob- servations and gather the samples. and i think it's really more of a mental factor than a physical factor."
"yes. that crash in chicago, can you tell me a little bit more about it?"
"exactly. 06 18 56 13 _ god, this is weird. 06 18 56 15 cml° isn't that a speetaeular sight, that sunrise?"
"okay, vhf a and b both checked out, with endeavour, loud and clear. and since we don't have anything other than the sequence camera to check out here, we're going to check that out and then powerdown and take care of the rest of the housekeeping without the power."
"dave, we're - we're hoping you will be talking to us for hours about it. we don't have any specific questions right now. we'll think about it and talk to you again, once you button up. maybe one last look for an alsep deployment position. and we've copied that you've gotten both sets of pictures for us. 04 ll 11 55 cdr-seva that's correct, joe. i - i limited myself somewhat on the - the 500s, because i think we'll get a chance to take a lot more of those. but i did get the pans for you."
"i guess when we get down to it, i ought to do that same thing to mine."
"- - in order to finish this loop, we got - we got to fine align the platform. 478 .-=.,. ll"
"i'm sorry. 00 01 14 24 [_p to get - to get commands - to get roll commands. here - here's one, ken."
casper_ houston. how do you read?
i think that rock hit there.
mark.
"joe, this is al. we've got down to the point where we want to get a cue from you to cycle the film."
"okay. panel 3: batter{ chat_(:e, off - you've already done that, jack - next ac inverti{n, inverter 2 off: panel 5: main bus tie bat b/c to bat b/c. huh? yes, it's up - the up posit_on. pane] 250: circuit bre,_ker, bat a power entry/ postlandin(; lo open; circuit breaker_ bat b fowiin entry/posti,andin(], open, panel 5: cb b%tteny cttai{ger b/vi'i3 charon, once. 0b'_y. i '11 let, you read that back, jack."
sunrise?
okay. e - the evcs is not in the ops?
"okay, very good."
"affirmative, jack. we've got you on a high gain and it appears to us that we're in wide beam - wide beam width."
right.
roger. copy. apollo 13 air-t0-ground voice transcription tape 8/]
yes.
okay. verify cuff gage has not dropped below 4.6. i'm looking at 5.1.
***. okay.
okay.
"okay, it says - take locator photo to lm. i thought i took a pan here. the lm wasn't - okay."
"roger. _4p ail of them - all of them very - very nicely defined as southern hemisphere cyclones. there are about four of those visible swinging around - oh, i guess, that's latitude - i'm having to guess here, but i'd say latitude 50 to 60 south."
copy that.
roger.
"okay. at 181:33, add ""trim burn - trim burn."""
mark.
yes?
372 with three rakes. over.
"where - where are you looking, now? !06 05 47 51 cmp that's a little bright crater with a ray-excluded zone that's just about south of m_dler. and i'm looking at m_dler now, and that stuff that makes the bright ray material going out the - to the east seems to come up to the rim. you can see it - it's brighter in that area along going down the - inside of the rim. then there's a bright streak that runs across the central area, right across and up the other side. and then it sort of stops when it gets to the other rim. but there's a faint evidence of a - of another continuation of that streak."
"okay, we can give you another one here if you'd like that."
came down slope - -
... like that.
mark it.
would you believe number 1 stuck out there?
"yeah, that's at 800 feet - - ll 01 48 23 cml° - - ... - - ·. coni t b ttlal"
okay. pan camera mode switch to standby. knd the pan calera power switch to power.
okay. okay. we're at 101.3 and it's bringing the h-dot down. starting our run now.
"go ahead, dick."
okay.
"okay, pete, i'll take this as my last one."
"if the headshrinks would like to listen to that, that way we wouldn't be scared."
"apollo 11, houston. we've got 10 minutes to los; see you over the hill at 131 48. over. 05 ]0 51 45 cmp okay, charlie. i'll dump the water as soon as we go around the corner."
"here, let me do it."
"yes, that's right. are you sure we want the - yes, that's right; 8-second intervalometer for looking at the nadir with the 80 millimeter. right?"
"and, you'd like to have - you want the quantities?"
"hey, i'm going to let this go to 8 minutes."
you are in our field of view now.
"roger. it looks like with all the stuff we have to throw over today, we're going to have to use another jettison bag."
roger.
okay.
"dumdum, tunk-e tunk-e tum. trying to learn to move faster. pretty good. hey, i feel great. how long we been out, houston?"
"stand by 1. we need the lm/cm delta-p for one thing, and i'll check back in a minute with the others."
so much for a thermal analysis. 06 06 06 47 cdr-ik4 yeah. it's about 72 degrees f on the ...
"you're coming in weak. i didn't quite copy it. 00 o1 03 42 l_p would it be okay, joe, if wc crank up the after we leave honeysuckle here?"
"hey, robert, what's the final cowboy score?"
"okay, here's number 8 - one, two, and she's fully released - the hook is off the docking ring."
"roger. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10."
"enter. come on, babe; do a good one. i got the dope. if i muff it again, i can - go to the charts again (laughter). i covered all bets. i think i'll take a look at a recycle here."
roger. we can just see; it looks like a little less than half of its rim right now.
"*** okay, i got a tone."
okay. go to operate -
roger. go ahead and turn those off.
"stand by a minute, charlie. step 7, page 2-3; 2-3, step 7. go to 2-3, step 7, charlie."
"roger. h2 tank 2 fan, on, for ell night."
"well, that's the last of the old orange juice junk - just finished it."
"okay, houston. the s-ii sep light was out on time."
"roger. standing by. 07 23 43 54 lm? okay, i'm ready to copy."
okay. that's in work.
roger. thank you.
"no, no. don't - let's have it east of the antenna. if we are there, let's deploy it right where you are."
"okay, houston, 15."
"okay. what did i have there, as a note? oh, that's - yes - -"
by the fresh spot down there.
"okay, you're in. 06 21 17 27 _-lm ...?"
"go ahead, tli plus 5."
okay·
"okay, 02 heaters 1 and 2 going to auto, and 3, off."
yes. that's interesting. b-2 and d-2 are both on.
when?
"oh, gol dig da! i'm having a hard time with this one."
"we don't like those heaters, anyway, wor!_'_- off the direct coils."
"okay. propellant quantity monitors, descent 1."
"houston, apollo 11."
"avoid that fella - stuck in there. hey, we're going south."
"large lioh can is in the pallet - pallet, houston."
"gordy, why don't you go ahead and load it yourself when you send up the vector?"
"okay. my camera is clean. magazine foxtrot - is on about frame 2, and i cycled through it. and i've got the core all set, and i'm going to go get it. and i didn't hear where you said to put it, bob."
"that's correct. cb glen,power, ac1 and ac2, closed. 05 06 56 o1 cml° cb g&n, power, ac1 and ac2, close."
"roger, troops. we'd like to tag up with you on the recommended tei procedures. and, al, i guess maybe you'll be doing this. and we - we're interested in reverifying the entries which you've made in your p40 sps thrusting _'heeklist, pages g 5-1 through to the end. and we've got, i guess, two new entries to put in, but we want to reverify the entries that you've already got in there. your choice, if you want to read those entries to us, or if you'd like to have us to read them to you. over. 09 03 19 l_ lmp okay, let's get a1 up on the headsets. stand by l, please."
()kay. we're getting ready to start the zero-phase observations on targets 5 and 6. we're a minute _d a half past the t-start time; waiting for 5 minutes - to put on the camera.
- - and get a couple of cores from you.
okay; the flight plan shows it in the postsleep.
"go. 0_ 21 08 45 i2,_p 5, !_,3_ 2, i. let me try it again. 0_ 21 09 02 lmp [, ]_,3, 2, !- 0_ 21 09 10 _mp _ire. 04 21 09 14 l_ _ hair trig - trigger, this isn't. okay - loading again - -"
okay can you push your camera up that far to get a picture of that?
"okay, pan c_mera photo pad, which is over at 233:20: t-start time, 233:24:07; t-stop, 38:42."
roger.
okay; you're clear of the suit. okay; it's lined up if you can zip me down all the way. 04 23 24 22 cdr-_m okay; it's locked. 04 23 24 23 i_{p-lm okay; leva's not locked though.
"no, we threw the_aaway."
"pull close to this big block, if you can."
all right. let's ease over there.
"roger. looks good here. 07 09 31400 cdr-lm okay, ken. you there?"
04:30 - -
roger.
"you know, it just may be that that south ray crater is - is so ... everything or most everything around here. you know, the - like we said about the rays at south ray, some were white and some were black rays and just a little layer of dust. i didn't see a - hardly a clear surface all day long. i felt right at home like we were back in the united states studying geology - and everybody said the rocks would be crystal clear. well, here it's all covered up. and it is my opinion when you hit one and got a cleavage surface - that made all the dif- ference in the world to a rock description, but a person may not be able to do that often."
could you - could you see what conditions i need to satisfy in order to do that?
"yeah. and it's tight. i can't budge it. you know, i wish i could cut my microphone off on my left side. that way i wouldn't get this drink bag squa - squirted in my face every time."
roger.
"listen, i'll tell you."
"well, not really. our checklist says before jettison only,i_ tunnel vent valve, i/_tunnel vent at least l0 minutes, period."
"it sure kicked up a lot of rocks. you - what are you going to do, go - go on the north side of it?"
"well, i don't know. i can't see your legs."
"houston, aquarius."
"i hope, with our position now, we can get on to doing some looking."
"yes.... let's see, i'm going to start getting up around ..."
got enough overlap there.
"okay. here's one right here, john, that'll make a good one. see that one right there by that footprint? that's a good sample size. about 5 centimeters across?"
copy that.
"11, houston. we suggest you go ahead and do the p52 first, and we'll take a look at the angles and give you some new drift rates after taking a look at them. over."
wait a minute.
i knew i was gonna do that. i knew it.
that is negative. stand by one.
can you reach it?
ail we need to do is call p47.
"okay. are the alsep signals satisfactory? age tonfidentia 6 05 14 59 43 cc that's affirmative. 05 14 59 45 cdp_ okay. heading back to the _,'_."
okay.
"right. at the end of step 5 and step 6, i put in a little statement ss_ing ""repeat step 4, damp rates."" that's really meant to say, ""repeat step 3,"" which is ""dsmp rates,"" in both cases."
roger. understand.
"and in case you're wondering, and so you don't confuse it with a rock, it's in bag 106."
"rcs a is reading 87; rcs b, 92; rcs c, 93; rcs d_ 96. is that what you wanted, the quantity of the rcs?"
get the picture before i step in it.
"go _o f/ll. get a little closer, geno, if you think you're minimum."
"cb eds, three, open."
"here we go. here comes the cable. here comes the monitor. well, go that way, i guess. oh, okay."
okay.
"okay, jim. we have t-38 is 151:58:58, t-39 is 153:57:03, t-40 is 155:55:07, t-41 is 157:53:14. over."
"yeah, we can land on omni. how does that thing look to you, ken? it it unstable everywhere?"
"we need those window heaters, though, just like you say."
"hello, challenger; houstonc you're very: very weak. over."
look it over.
okay. if you got - if you got a few more going off here in short order don't you?
"_n_d, vance, thought we'd get a picture of jack just so that all the girls know that he's still here."
"roger, ed."
okay. fine.
okay. we've get 20 seconds or so.
okay. here's a good piece right up here. okay.
okay .... john.
"apollo ll, this is houston. if you will give us po0 in accept, we have a state vector update for you."
"dave, how many more sections are coming apart?"
okay.
roger. we'll have them for you in a second.
"oh, roger. we're halfway through lm - lmp plss donning."
okay. get that.
okay. go to s-band. reading about 15.
we already loaded p15. o0 02 02 47 _ okay.
alni lam- alni lam.
"hey, jim. _"
the grand prix driver is at it again.
you got it coming at you.
we're right on schedule .... to 3000.
you must be.
...
"okay, and, gene, i think you need to go aux - -"
okay. i copy that.
d - -
"roger, ken. we just want to run the film out _ld leave the door shut. we want to get the image motion, on; mapping camera, on; and barber pole plus 2. that gives us a higher speed."
"okay. we're about 2 minutes from los. i don't guess we're going to be able to get this pad to you, and we're not going to see you for another rev, about 3 hours."
i don't think they ever expected ... - -
"okay, bob. *** wish i could *** bit better. 06 17 h4 57 lmp-eva the major boulders still look like the - the pyroxene gabbro. *** texture has not changed. there is a - there is a granule population, now that i look at it more closely, with the shadows. but i have a feeling that most of those are - they look like they're just small, very small clods. that should show up in some of the bulk samples we've taken. it is remarkable to me the - only a small number of fine-grain rocks. there's one at about halfway between the sep and the lm that i'd like to pick up. it's a fairly good sized one. maybe we can get it when we get back. it looks like a fine-grained basalt .... - cdr-eva well, i tell you, it's not exactly the greatest place to navigate through."
i reckon too.
"the numbers, jim."
5.0; 4.5; 4.0. 05 22 14 16 cdr-i_m mark; 3.5.
"okay, we didn't get you there for about 5 minutes, bob, with good up-link signal strength. were you guys having a problem?"
"17, houston. i have the morning news here, when- ever you'd like to hear it - if you would."
"gee, i'm sorry; you're in the hash again. i missed that last."
"and, endeavour, it's your computer."
yes. i'd turn towards your right.
because it's interconnected with the waste water system.
copy that.
"get your scoop up. that - that's it. that's it. that's good, jim. that's about half - can you get another one? hey, don't slide down in there, that - that's really slippery. 06 00 3i 58 ii,p-eva yes. i noticed."
"chow is sure getting short. okay, partner, how about it? 06 05 09 57 lmp-l_ ... what am i pulling up?"
"apollo 13, houston."
okay. secure harness and self doff straps.
"okay. understand. scratch inhibit jets, and substitute damp rates for 5 minutes, and then cmc, free, and the 1/125th replaces the 1/500th on the camera."
"well, i'll say one thing for old van serg, it's blocky. whoo ! 06 21 23 20 cdr-a%'a mark. gravimeter."
"columbia, houston - -"
"okay, don. i was just going to let it - see how it does - i just moved it to about the middle amount i could. and the ops is now reading 800 psi."
"well, you know the ball valve actually opened up ... like that ... and i usually - -"
you want me to get down?
"hey, beautiful. 04 17 10 06 _ i think we got our problem solved."
yes. let's see - 90 - -
want to plot another point?
okay.
i must have a boulder ... lmp-e%ra i'll get it. let me - -
go ahead. h2 tank 1 fan is off.
cool it here for a minute.
i did it. it's pretty comfortable. it's cool. you want me to turn yours off? ...
you've already cycled that wheel all the way_ haven't you?
"well, i think i'd remember from yesterday, and that's what i thought gordy said. okay. that's in, locked, verified."
let me cap that end. don't move it.
"okay, casper. this is houston. we're convinced that we want you to fire directly at the lm, about 5 feet per second. we want to get a positive closing rate."
"stand by on that. okay; no problem, jack."
"okay, you watch the - trajectory thrust?"
"bob, what's the lm impact time?"
"apollo 11, houston. if it's convenient with you, we have an loi-1 pad that we can pass up to you now. over."
"11, houston. do you read? over."
"roger; understand high gain, minus l0 and 260 on high gain."
okay. give me a verb 41 noun 72.
roger. this all occurs on the rev after next.
"okay, that's getting closer."
"stand by l, jim."
"344.7, 340.9, ... _^k.lrlr_l_klti a i age confidentt4#. 04 15 3_ 17 cmp hello, houston. this is kitty hawk."
"okay_ hold the camera there, tony, and i'll put the sunshield on."
"well, when i'm on level ground, i can skip. but this two-legged thing is great. man, i can cover ground like a kangaroo. oh, okay. you documented already; i was just going to put this in the field of view anyway."
"okay, where's that super gal located? is that where it's at, huh?"
- - because it's not pcwered- -
you're bumping into the - the purse there. ***for- ward.
"that's correct, 17."
okay.
"apollo ll, apollo ll, this is houston. do you read? over."
... open - -
"did you see that? 00 o0 51 06 izip yes, i saw a flash."
john. we'll take those numbers.
"okay, gene."
okay. coming on 2 minutes.
"boy, it takes forever, doesn't it?"
"let's see. how about o, p, and q?"
"roger. in work. would you believe, it came on!"
"okay, we got our fuel cell purge now?"
"roger, al."
okay.
"okay. you come up with what you think best on that, and i going to copy john."
"not sideways, it wouldn't be."
i - let me carry part of it or something. okay. let me go pull out the core tube.
"that antenna is still pointed right to earth. ·.. normal, though. it never had to move."
"we won't be able to see the lm from down here. we'll be too iow to see it. fact is, i don't think i can see that far."
"maybe i got a prd, jim. 04 o0 ll 55 (clanking)"
"the one up top you did? 07 03 13 55 lmp-_i wait a minute. no, i didn't get that one. sorry, john. i was looking at the one down below."
okay; let's go. you got a spot picked while you're here?
"15, houston. over."
"roger. about how big is it? 05 12 45 56 imp it's about a foot and a half, 2-footer - yes, about a foot and a half across. iconfidential' 6 0_ 12 46 06 cdr that was a glass splatter, fred."
"okay, joe. why don't you give us about 5 minutes with no comment and let us cool it for a while, okay?"
"okay, we'd like to go back to nominal configuration."
"i tell you, charlie, we feel the same way."
stand by 1. i'll get you a number. they're saying an hour and 50 minutes.
"sounds like a good plan if you can work that out, jim."
"shake it. well, i thought there was one in there."
"give me the checklist, ed. 08 23 59 52 l_[p okay. ... complete. 08 23 59 53 new apollo 1_, new orleans. request crew status and voice report. over."

"i expect we want to get - let's go as deep as we can in the orange, please, there, jack. and vhe one problem at this station, jack, is not that - -"
is that what it says?
about as - how is it in azimuth? and i'll look for it in pitch.
"up on your planet, the latest word is that the rover is still functioning - functioning brilliantly, and the fellows are well into eva number 2 and just recently passed crescent crater and dune crater - well on their way to exploring the front at hadley delta."
mode 2 lockon.
"you want pitch, 0; yaw at 30; manual and wide. that's pitch, 0, yaw 30; _nual and wide."
okay.
"okay, and when you're over at the s-band, we have a couple of more pictures of that one."
"we can see the probe pretty well, and we carlsee his hands quite well there."
"hey, al. we want to change the dead band in p20 here - -"
"okay. where's my pencil? i got it right here. ail right? it says right up there, ""prep, step 2."""
"we noticed that, too."
a couple of them look fairly coarsely crystalline. okay. *** in there.
"yeah, summarize it for us, please."
do you want to use the spring or you want to use the strap?
minus b.
"i had it pinned down for you, until i got to about 500 feet, when i changed my mind."
no. but i didn't have the power on. see? i didn't have the suit power on.
"roger. csm weight, 37679; pitch, 0.49; yaw, 1.04."
how many?
yes.
"yes, it's - -"
"i'm sorry, charlie. go ahead."
okay.
"okay. oh, yeah."
do you acknowledge that?
okay.
"well, let's open her up a little more."
*** about parking on the south-east rim.
"both hf and vhf look good, and we saw no visible interference on the csm telemetry."
you're right.
"here comes - logic power jett 1 to jett, and number 2 to jett."
"hey, houston, 15."
730.
", we ought to be getting it out - -"
"dac's - was 6 frames per second, and what did you say - 6 feet?"
it's supposed to sound that way.
"let me loosen it, and get it a little straighter."
you should have told them last july.
"i'll come over and get your antenna, dave."
"that's affirmative, jack."
sculptured hills.
"man, that - i think we're probably pitch 20 and roll 20."
"hello, apollo 11. houston. if you read, this attitude 000 is pretty bad for our comm. in fact, we've lost all data with you, and unread- able on the voice. we recommend you do the p52, option 1 preferred ..."
"and we need a tephem, ken."
"seems so to me. our procedures people are working on this, and we'll be back with you momentarily. over."
"boy, what a view of the rille, huh? bolder tracks slip down into_it. (music - ""air force song,)"
"what sh - what should our heading be down here now, charlie?"
"and that's a lighter - lighter albedo demarcation, there."
okay. let's go get the host rock here.
roger that.
"star 37 will be fine for the optics calibration. and we haven't noticed a verb 66, yet, after our state vector uplink. over."
"ags mode control, att hold."
"houston, cdr was at 382 to 270."
"i'm not. it's pretty steep. if you jackrabbit up it, it's pretty easy to do. there's a place right here that's got a lot of good ones."
"yeah. that's in bag 371, houston."
"roger. 05 05 43 14 i,mp-eva okay, joe, you say pick up at 6:28?"
yes.
"yeah, don, what i was gonna say is that the - the peapacks [?] on the shaft are within - yeah - the readability of the dsky. the trunnion then seems to be off by about 2/100, which i think is a pretty fine agreement. and for the interest of some of those people who are talking about these optics and whether they drift or not, if you can watch 1691 right now, you'll find that i'm in - the mode is manual and i'm in direct, and you can watch them drift slowly. and at low rate, i'll go to resolve, and they drift at approximately the same rate. there seemed to be some question about that earlier. i thought - some of the guys in the back might be interested in that."
"casper, houston. just a little reminder - about time for - to open the alpha particle x-ray cove r."
i don't ...

"and, aquarius, just to get you thinking in that direction, we've run a fairly thorough analysis, and we've found out that it's going to be cheaper to keep the lgc and the dsky up and turn the inverter and the ball off. it's going to save us 1 amp and also some water, so it looks like what we're going to do. and we'll have to monitor the middle gimbal angle. and we'll get the procedure on that, and it'll also be an easier control mode where we'll be able to use the ttca through the - through the dap."

roger.
okay. sounds great.
"okay, bob. as i look at the clock, we're - just 24 hours ago we were about within our hold some- where. for this period yesterday we were in our hold, and i think it goes without saying; but we'd sure like to pass on our bit of gratitude and thanks for the response that the people down at the cape came up with. and particularly at marshall. i think we all knew no one would be going anywhere unless everyone was satisfied that we were going all the way. and that's certainly the way we felt, bet we do want to thank everybody who had a part in making that come true."

"okay, vance. we're po0 and accept. the computer' s yours."

"yes, and mine's leaked about ... some."
"... first thing we've been concerned about - i guess we'll start off with this is, according to our data, you lost about 25 pounds of water during the post-eva yesterday, and, we - it - it appears that it leaked out during that problem you had with the broken bacteria filter. what we're wondering is if you've looked around carefully in the cabin, and noticed any sign of that 25 f_ pounds of water. we suggest looking back behind the ascent engine cover, because it possibly would have run back there and not have been obvious to you. over. 05 18 05 08 cdr-i_ okay. there was some on the floor in the ... deck, and we just never took the time to take a look in the back, but we will."

okay.
roger. it'll work. good. it just came on. would you believe? it came on.
make it?
"ah, i'll tell you what. we'll go up there, and do a 360 pan. how would that be?"
"okay. i've got an eps monitoring check here; sec- ondary g_yco1 loop check, and we've got the cameras out already."
get it.
"i'm sorry, bob. go ahead."
look at that one.
"ron, just for my information - -"
"well, how the hell do we put a pcm cable in this thing, then?"

there's some mighty healthy craters down there.

"okay, houston, falcon. we're seeing a fairly large difference in z between the onboard solutions and the ground solutions. but, i guess that can be expected at the recycle."
"wish we could figure a way to get a hot cum of coffee up to you. it'd probably taste pretty good about now, wouldn't it?"
and i expect to see him back in houston soon.

"hellc, houston. do you read?"
"roger. we've got a procedure we'd like to go through to eventually put the ecs radiators flow control over to auto, and we have a bunch - several steps we'd like to go through before you do that move. cml° okay. wait a minute; i'll write them down here so we can ..."

"okay; guidance control, ags."

did they have any trouble getting up there? i guess not.
"okay, a comm check with me and houston."
"(laughter) jim, you want to talk about that? why don't you go ahead? not too hard, though (laughter)."
yes.
"do, do, do, do, do, do, do."
"well, the roll indicator says 15 degrees; and the pitch indicator says about 12. i don't know if i believe all that. bob, you with us?"
"yes, yes."

the old geophone cable caught on the corner.
"okay, and now we'll - -"
okay; 52.
roger; stand by.
"and, ken, in regard to the - the attitude and angle changes, - the only thing on your eva cue card that - that i saw that required changing was the high-gain angles."
"yes.... time. oh 23 16 08 cdr that's pretty good cooling, isn't it? oh 23 16 09 lmp beautiful."
"okay; bag number 4 is on the lmp. okay. get me, ole buddy."
okay. verify cabin pressure stable at 4.6 to 5.0 ...... let's watch iv here.
"oh, yes. it's no problem. you know, it's the same problem you always have. you get these threads - get a little side force on them and - you know, with the helmet and gloves and what have you - it's just - you can't - sometimes they go on easy; sometimes they don't."
could you give us a readback on everything up to this point?
"you know, we don't have the deep craters anymore. the deepest around here may be half a meter or so, and we don't have the rocks, the debris on the surface; just a few. as a matter of fact, right here at 347, range 4.0, it's pretty smooth."
"okay, houston. the location is in about the least cratered area i could find, between a large crater or a large depression that's about - oh, ranges from maybe 50 to 150 meters behind the lm. that's maybe - south - or east-southeast; and it's between that depression and another large depression that is really a doublet with a blocky septum between them. that's to the northeast of the lm about 200 meters; that's the start of that second depression. i think we can get a nice layout, although there'll be a general slope, i believe, towards the lm - of about 1 degree."
"that's affirmative, and did you copy about the readout on the battery and charger?"
no dap light is off.
"you're r_ght, bob. z'm going to take a _'est. you bet you. man, z hate to say it, hut, i - i had that 25 percent of the way there. i can feel it ticking now. i'm going cold."
now let's - -
"good morning, america, and we'd appreciate high gain to auto so we could talk to you all the way through los."
"radar mode, slew."
"the color boundary is not associated with any rille or anything that i can see. doesn't look like there's any topographic expression to it, c_p there it is. 06 13 _8 16 cc thought you might be interested, ron. we just woke up the challenger, and they're all doing fine. cml° oh, hey, good, good. sounds like robert. you back on?"
does the antenna look like it's pointed at earth? wait.
it's up to you .... i want to float up in tile tunnel. do you want to float up and look?

"go ahead, jack."
okay. take a good look at cabin.
"delta-vs compare pretty close, as matter of fact."
get that rear hinge off of there.
that's affirmative. transcript of communications between cc and lm resumed
"what? 07 04 18 01 imp sure doesn't, does it?"
i can't -
"actually, it's commander transfer to cm and you mean close hatches. plural, right?"
okay; good.

"yeah. no, i didn't."
"okay, let's start over on meal b for the lmp."

that's true (laughter).

"okay. you don't have it - you don't have it unlocked. now let her go. no, you don't have it ,mlocked, john. it's - got it over center. push it - now let your hand go. see - wait a minute. now. you got to let this thing go - you're pushing here."
"you're out there all alone, too, aren't you?"
"the gdc is aligned, and we verified that the lm valve is in lm/cmdelta-p."
"wednesday, i think i might shave. 07 22 l0 38 c_ that won't - it wontt hack it, charlie."
i thought you might be able to break it up.
"okay, i'm going to be moving the tv directly. i'm going to pull it out of this bracket, jim."
(laughter)
just check - check that antenna; make sure it's level.
"how many times higher that that? that's 10 times higher then what the apollo 12 guys got, isn't it?"
"dmd moonset, houston."
"go ahead, houston."
"ail right. turn your power on now, stu. mode, single."
who's the eecom this morning?

"no, we didn't ... there on the right."
okay. 04 04 29 00 cn_p is the rate staj_ting to build now? i'm trying to calibrate the dead-band activity here so i can tell what the rate - when it's really a rate and when it's just dead banding.
"well, that sounds marginally acceptable."
"yes. i thought you checked them all, jim. sure. check them all. sure."
because there's no blocks around it at all.
roger. give me the csi time again.
"roger. and that's over there near - near november. okay. that's to write down. the rest of this, for a while anyway, is kind of just advisory. this new location adds approximately 0.6 kilometers to the eva-1 traverse and, therefore, about 6 minutes driving time. however, that's only provisionary, of course, and our indications of a beautiful flat plain out there may mean that we'll make up some of that time just in being able to drive faster than we were perhaps anticipating. if this is not the case - -"
see if we got any other place ...
"say again_ fred. 03 23 27 23 lmi' brings up another possibility. now that we've got all of that stowed into the bags and the condensate can, we could probably blow all of that through the plss ..., i wonder how the sublimator woald work on waste water."
mark it. upper light came on.
i think you all - - q0 00 26 03 cdr what was that?
"might be the same kind, john, that you picked up on the way there."

"if they come, i bet they don't quit."
"okay, safe the pyros. logic 2 is off, logic 1 is off."
roger. we're reading him loud and clear.
"okay. noun 71 were stars 22 and 24; noun 05 are all balls; noun 93s are all minus. they're 00.037, 00.007, and 00.021. that's minus 37, minus 07, and minus 21; and they were torqued at 01:51:40."
roger.
okay.
okay. hope i can find it this time again (laughter). wouldn't that be a heek of a note?
roger. you're loud and clear.
roger. i have the t1 and t2 times and also the longitude of the 130 prime. we're working on the grid squares and we'll get them shortly.
"red to red and blue to blue. yes, we've got to do a dump."

"okay, suit's on 17"
"i got a satisfactory - every once in a while i can hear them now; they're cutting in and out somewhere, i don't know where."

okay.

"it appears that the - - o1 i0 06 ll cdr well, we can't observe much green fror the space- craft."

"help push that ... in. that's hard to do, pres- surized. in fact, it's impossible. i'm so dirty, i can't believe it."
"okay. we just had a battery warning .., bat- tery 2."
very good.
yes.
"15, this is houston. we'd like to have a lm/cm delta-p whenever you can cheek that number for us?"
i got it.
"17, houston. we noted down here that your suit diverters went to egress and we want the demand regs to the egress position, please. i_mp-i_ that's right, but the suit gas diverter extends when you go to egress."
...
"we had - we lost high gain on america, so we inhibited the down-link. we're not in relay, no."
"oh, ... i missed australia."
that's all on 3-122. next change is 3-125.
"how does that look to you, pete? these are locked."
"coming good. _-lm p20 going, h_a? 26.6 breaking - -"
"okay, you got the angles, and you're going to reacq."
"15, this is houston. we still have a concern _ about your ops pressure and would appreciate it, if it's at all accessible, to have a reading at the present time."
"casper, houston. are the gdc ball and the imu ball completely out of sync?"
can you get it off?
"ken, i think they are. but i think you'll find that the ones in station 6 are much more metamorphic rock, or recrystallized rock, than the ones we had at station 2. i had the impression that the ones we were sampling at station 6 were - were really inclusions in the - anorthositic gabbro - and had - had been probably considerably meta- morphosed by it being included in it; whereas, the ones we had at station 2 were a separate rock type apparently, as i recall it, anyway."
get that?
"what do you think about that, joe?"
*** go? jack?
"okay, there you are."
"yeah, i did. i inched over it. i saw the dang - i saw the - i saw - i saw the ground all the way to touchdown, ken. these guys have been saying they can't see the ground. i saw it."
no. i was just wondering what you wanted setting on the - on the high gain is all.
"no, i'm getting a pan, here. (laughter) ©6 02 16 25 cdr-eva oh, really? oh. that's an awful fast pan."
"apollo 15, houston."

okay. can you - will the rake pull out any rocks - in there? take a rake sample down in the - the hole there.
"that's affirmative. i got secs arm, two, close, verify."
i'll give you a hack at the east rim.
"okay, al, good idea. 04 22 34 55 imp say again? 0_ 22 34 56 cdr i wish we had more rocks. 04 22 35 00 i_mp okay, i'm core tubing it, right now."

"ail right. and the last is the circuit breakers for sps gaging, four of them, open."
"gee whiz. that's not bad for a three rev slip, huh?"
"okay. and - got a - a change here to your systems checklist - and this is just changing to reflect the increased pressure in the battery compartment. if you'd like to change that, it's page s/l-2, under step 3."
but that's a big beautiful boulder on the - -
"so it's no problem. you're above nominal on all your consumables. on the h2 tank problem, we have a procedure that we'd like you to carry out which is simply turning the h2 tank 2 heaters to off at this time s and we want to see whether that won't solve the problem of the tank pressure setting off caution and warning. we want te look at it that way for a few hours."
"okay, go ahead."
"hello, houston, apollo 15. the falcon is on its perch."
"okay, number 3 went from auto to off, tank i is going from off to on."
"okay. okay, just a second. just let me get the door open. there's door wide open. you want my golden buzzer?"
"hey, houston; aquarius."
"okay, turn it off. l0 00 02 5i cdr looks like _9 to us. go; don't talk about it."

yes.

okay; coming at you.
"okay, the mapping camera is coming on to standby."
"but as soon as we get the tv up, anybody would be able to tell where we're at."
okay. 04 21 51 h8 cdr i got it steadied.

"okay. let me get my - i've got to get - something's u_der my foot there. okay, i've got to get my foot low in order to get in. want me to go back out? hey, okay; swing. oh, not quite. got to get this thing up where i can see something."
"and, charl e, we've got commands again. we'll har_dle the antenna and the bit rate for you now."
that's what i figured.
ail right. take your time; i was just trying to get all this dirty work out of the way so you'd have an u_ainterrupted eat period.

"and, jack s houston. it'll be 100 seconds on that."
"tranquility base, houston. we would like to delay that loio - lioh change until after the eva. there is a possibility you could jettison the canister when you jettison your plss. over."
that's all right.
"thank you, jim."
okay. configure for single ring rcs.
"okay. i think they're about ready to dc it now. challenger, america. you about ready for _ vhf ranging?"
"roger. and if you'll give us a cue just a little bit ahead, we'll get them to go to voice so they can pick you up."
"okay, ken. just at this appearance, it appears that everything is swinging along all right with them, but we'll have you a good scientific read- out on it tomorrow."
yeah. time skip

yes. there's something ...
"okay. evidently, that station switch gave us some problems. i've been ccpying ***"
"oh, i see what's happened now. there's a - there's a little hill that's shielding - i - i see where davy crater chain is now. and it's right in the middle of a big long shadow that's being cast out there. and it's shielding that whole area because davy and davy y show up nicely. and davy g is easy to see. but the chain itself, i can just make out, and i'll take a picture - well, this is a skewed angle. i don't know if i can get it to show you, buy - they sure must not have much of a lip on them if they don't show. but, by the time we see them, they may be in a fairly high sun. ]5 02 19 00 cc roger; copy, ken."
"okay. i had a change in the background noises, wondered if you were still there."
"... water flag a. okay, see if you can torque the - open forward hatch, i guess."
"okay, houston. it looks like we've got a good high-gain antenna. do you want us to give you the high gain or stay on the omni?"
okay.
okay?
we'll check. f tape_9/1 apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription

okay.
"apollo 11, houston. say again. over."
"cae,in repress, i'm turning to get it - to turn it to auto. 05 15 42 03 cdr/l_p okay."
you're welcome.
"yes, we've been watching that one."
i'm kind of worried about this camera back here. it might come banging down.
"oh, yes. we're almost gone."
good.
"okay, tony. we'll get 215 pounds of rock."
"okay, pan's complete."
"vertical. okay, helmet and visor, alined and adjusted. 06 _9 07 12 lmp-lm okay, it is. 06 19 07 13 cdh-lm 02 connectors, three, locked."
i can get it.
"okay. i've got you, charlie, as soon as i can get you ... hands ... man, got some dirt right in here on - hold your arm up. there you go. _-- but your hose is clean."
really an amazing vehicle.
okay.
"and, john, you can do the lpm any time."
i got it.
"and even from this distance. youknow, i'm _lmost to the western edge of crisitun, looking back across there, and even from this distance, you can still see the - the color boundary between the two and as far - it goes up north by posidonius, and then it kind of blends in and it will look - as far as i can tell anyhow. going from posidonius on around to the north side of serenitatis. of course, it's a long ways away, and i really can't see, but i couldn't tell a definite demarcation. it just kind of blended in from the tan to - to the dark tan."
"sesc, huh?"
"roger. we noticed over the last half hour or so, a 25-pound drop in the water quantity. we're wondering if you guys have been doing something. know anything about that you could clue us in on?"
can the guy with the seismometer hear me running?
... between the mortar package and the - mortar package and the rover?
what they're going to do is ... power aquarius up ...
(laughter)
i got a star in it now.
"okay, don. this is the 174, 212, and 64, right?"
"and all battery indications on board were normal, once i got started."
"oh, i think we're all breathing easy now. and if we can, we'd like to get a quick look at the cmp because we're going to have to give up the lines here in a couple of minutes."
"ron, i just might draw your attention to the flight plan at 167:20, in that area where the lunar sounder finishes up, and it says that there will be no sim bay or pcm data recorded until 169:03 and then you have to configure the dse there. just want to draw your attention to that."
"okay, jack. we're getting that last confirmation. stand by, please."
okay.
yes. okay.
"shoot, you're way ahead of me. okay. how about the e- - oh, well, we'll get - -"
"roger. we concur, and we surely wish we could see it firsthand, also. (doss net 1) tape 49/4 03 04 35 b2 lmp we're going over the messier series of craters right at the time, looking vertically down on them, and messier a we can see good sized blocks in the bottom of the crater. i don't know what our altitude is now, but in any case, those are pretty good size blocks. ob 04 35 56 cc okay. just roughly, it looks like you are about 120 miles or 1bo miles right now - make that 127 miles. ob 04 37 12 cdr we're approaching pdi point now. over."
"okay. how's that look, jack?"
"we have you - stand by, buzz. roughly about 50 000. stand by."
"not halfway, just enough - -"
okay.
"okay. why don't you slip around here? 05 21 53 28 cdr-i_ get your ops. 05 21 53 32 ia_p-lm that water is cold, isn't it? 05 21 53 26 cdr-i_ okay. 05 21 52 42 i2_°-i24 0ps 02 hose to pga blue, blue."
okay. pin it down.
"yes, sir. but we got to sample something."
"roger. remember back a ways, we were talking about doing some more mass spec boom tests at 275 hours, which has gone by. we're right now talking about delaying that until 276 hours, approximately, or at least until before you start your verb 49 maneuvers for the next set of p23s. over."
can you - reach over there and unsnap one of those - unsnap one of those hose lines?
"okay. on d-caldera, you want to go, f/8 at 1/250."
"roger, houston, 15. you're loud and clear."
"okay. a little short, huh?"
"okay, and back on panel 2, we want 02 heaters 1 and 2, aut0, and 3, off."
here.
it sure looks nice.
"well, again you can speak of test - or color dif- ferences on the thing. and the sun angle now look- ing west - you get the same streaked - well, the verticle streaks that i talked about before that you see on the backside at the high sun angle - higher sun angles again. and that seems to show up more and more, i think, at the higher sun angles. and these are the - what i call - radial - radial streaks down in the fresh craters that essentially start at the top of the crater rim and go down inside of them. if you take a look at these streaks, i don't - i don't see how they could be due strictly to the sun angle on them, i think, because they're all the way around the crater."

"down to 1 foot a secona. if he'd get a little bit more closing rate in, it'd be less gas."
"hello, there, ron. if you read, we're reading you."
we want to just get one last confirmation.
thing looks level as can be to me.
"*** makes any difference. *** and locked, and dust cover, verify. *** the comm?"
... where they are.
go ahead.
"and, 16, houston. whenever you get a chance, we'd like to get yesterday's crew status and today's crew status report."
roger. i was looking at your no_ 89 there and comparing it with the value in the pad there. 04 o0 39 20 cmr oh! thank you very much. thank you. you've got good eyes.
"that's light-colored soil from a depth of about - it's mixed with a little of the upper surface, but mostly light-colored soil from a depth of about 15 centimeters."
"charlie, get a picture of the lm."
"we got to turn on the lights_ char!ie,"
"that is for state vector, okay? 03 22 49 21 lm? we'll get the verb 74."
"hey, when that thing turned around, guys, the crosshairs in the coa8 are within the docking target."
yes. how do you read?
"i'll get it off, charlie. i'm putting the caution and warning back to normal."
"okay, eon - -"
"wait, i'll give you a little more slack. you up there?"
okay.
"okay, and - and break in and tell me as soon as you get the ds - get ready to dump the dse, so you can take a look at what i'm talking about, and i'll leave the antenna manual and wide until you do. okay; the text is that we came up to the burn time and i was going through the gimbal checks. number 1 servo started normally, checked out. i switched to - clockwise on the thc to perform the secondary gimbal check and started them - they looked normal. i set the pitch trim normally, and i went to set the yaw trim; i've just been checking that the trim lock [?] worked, and i got divergent oscillations on the yaw trim indicator, and you could feel them in the spacecraft. so i switched to the - servo power to the number 2 servo to ac1/main a, tried that. that had no effect. then i cycled through looking at - at the gimbal - with the auto drive switch in number l, number 2 in auto. every time i selected number 2, by some means, i had the same results. then i tried scs in auto, and as soon as i would excite some motion in the secondary yaw servo, why it would go unstable again. i then tried using the g&n to drive the gimbal, and i did the first half of the gimbal drive in servo loop 1, then switched to the servo loop 2 for the second half, and again the same instability showed up. based on the rule of four servo loops, i canceled circ. i had no other indications in the cockpit, no warning lights, no - no other abnormalities."
the lm middle gimbal is 011.79.
"apollo ll, houston. how do you read me through honeysuckle now? over."
okay. i got that one.
"okay; you have no weight to that. roger. and, jim, the- -"
we'll make sure of its change on the next dome removal tool.
"buzz, i would like to confirm that your tpi (columbia) tig is 127 02 02. over."
okay.
"okay. houston, i just picked up a grab sample of a breccia. it's very friable. it looks shocked; it has black clasts in it - black clasts a couple of _illimeters across. and the - it's so worn down that you know what it really looks like? it looks like a - if i can use the analogy - i'm not sure what the heck it is. it looks like a - a tuft. it just looks like a rock with a - you see, the clasts are sticking out of it, is what i'm saying. 06 22 53 20 i2_p-eva 0kay, tony. what other pictures you want me to get with the 500? i've done the interior of the crater. you - you say you wanted smoky or stone mountain?"
yeah. we are. 07 gl 08 25 cc okay; understand.
"okay. just below 13. and just for your infor- mation, we've got people working on several subjects. we're working on the midcourse coming up to determine our control system and how to do it with the control system we select, what we should do about the alinement. we've got the lms and a co_]p]e of crews cranked up working on that. aridwe're also working on our entry, how and when we ought to activate the csm. and we're working on the csm systems status. to- morrow sometime we're going to have a main bus b checkout, so we've got a lot of people swinging pretty hard here and i've got some f-stop settings for you for the lvanar-surface camera. at 1/250th, we'd like you to take targets of opportunity. each picture use three f-stops, because we don't know exactly which one is going to work the best, so use 4, 5.6, and 8 and 1/250th for the surface camera. copy?"
"(laughter) i'm sorry, stu. i can't believe that; stu always has something to add. (singing) houston, in case you just noticed, i forgot the verb 67 until just now. although, in reality, all we're trying to do here is get a delta-h measurement anyhow. and, houston, do you have any feel yet for what the delta-h is - line has been?"
we have done that -
"okay, i'm tidying up the mesa blanket. i'm pretty tidy. lmp-i_ i did that."
the locator is of henry.
"okay. houston, apollo 13."
yes.
"seem a lot lower - 40,000 feet over the moon than 40,000 feet in an airplane - don't you? it's like you could reach down and touch it."
yes; it's on. and we want to get a large block.
"okay, apollo 15. this is your friendly news reporter with the morning news. apparently the houston post reported, yesterday, that the falcon's checkout went smoothly, and the mission is proceed- ing on schedule. the inside pages show drawings of how you will deploy the lunar roving vehicle. they didn't tell us anything i think we don't already know so i won't go into the details of the drawings. in national news - now, we may be use - losing communications now; i'll stand by a minute."
"you're always one step ahead of me. some quick questions about the rover now. could you confirm that battery 2 amp-voltmeter always reads zero, please."
...
very good.
"okay, _ i got it wound up."
by a long shot.
"that's what i told them. station 9, i got a football-size rock, and i've put it in there."
thank you.
"okay, the only reason i had been using att hold before was because we were simulating loss of - of the imu; and, in that case, i wanted to use the attitude gyros because they had less drift. and it made the marking simpler; but, in this case, i might as well let it - give it a burp and let it track along."
"that's right in the door, though. let me slide that in here."
huh?
"stick your camera in the etb and get the film can out of there, and i'm going to start packing up the gear. 05 1_ 48 36 lmp okay, here is the camera."

"okay, bob. we had - as usual - up here (laughter) a spectacular sunrise, and gene wants to talk to you."
go ahead with the update.
"oh, loud and clear. i - i guess you probably didn't get my comment about the glint over on stone mountain?"
"that'll do it. keep poking this water hose here. cdr-_ 211 is yours. _p-_ 208 is mine. _.lm okay, the pin is in. it's closed, you're in low flow, ta_p-!_ _lieve it or _t, it still works."

okay. we copy that.
"you can rendezvous under these conditions very nicely, the problem being that you've got to keep referring to that - to the reticle to get some kind of range, because there's _ust no - you still don't have enough depth perception to tell where you are."

roger. and we just recovered our read-out of - we got a good voltage reading down here now.
"i think this camera is probably a little dirty on the lens. okay, houston. we're parked. no. the lens is okay. when you uncover one of those lens brushes, i want to use it on my visor. oh_ boy."

"ll, this is houston. would you care tc_comment on some of these craters as we go by?"
we're okay.
"roger. referring to the procedure on g/8-2, if you have that open, i'll tell you what we had to give you."
"i'm going to wipe it, but not with my glove. i'm going to wipe it with this little cloth that pro- tects my wrist ring. it doesn't have any struc- tural thing - anything structurally associated with it."
"okay. now on panel 8, i'm going to have to read you a number of circuit breakers that we want open, and so start with cb panel 8 all closed except leave the two that we have there cm/rcs heaters, open, and float bag open, and add the following. i'll read them up one at a time, and you can roger. scs logic bus, four, to open. over."
okay give us a call. we're ready _o copy the weights. lmp- i_m okay.
go ahead.
guess what? ' 05 01 09 50 cc it slowed down.
we 're not.
"that's affirmative. and, al, when you get a chance, can we get your photo numbers?"
"yeah, i figured."
"cb(16): display/engine override - logic, closed."
- - i'd say we're probably both ready.
- - rcs pressurization. you might turn the heater switch off. l_p and - i just did.

"yes, sir."
"well, it'll roll along here, except we can just move faster carrying it."
ready to copy.
okay. how much further?
okay.
where did it go?
"okay, i'm gonna put magazine foxtrot into the etb, and it's got 130 frames exposed."
okay.

roger. 029.
go ahead. over.

"suit gas diverter, egress."
"yes, gordy, but it - it blends in so well; all we're seeing is a - an undulating high as the rim. and to the best of my knowledge, we've got the south rim at - or correction, the east rim right at 12 o'clock. hey, gordy, right at 12 o'clock also is a boulder that's at least 3 meters and maybe 5, and i wouldn't be a bit surprised if you can find it. it's on a line between us and the intersection of the south massif and the family moun - mountain horizon. just slightly left of that line or south of that line. and that boulder ought to show up on your best photography."
okay. come on over here and hold your foot against that thing. just hold that - that little thing down. that's the main thing. ready?
... open.
"thank you, sir."
okay. you got it.
"what is this thing around the backup, charlie?"
that's done.
- - they're not going to work. i can't free them up - -
"roger, you're going to have lots of time to do that."
go ahead.
"okay, fred. we understand that and one more item for clarification on the water. we don't really know what your usage of potable is. that was purely an estimate assuming a fairly healthy usage. 04 o1 21 57 _ okay."
yes.
"oh, you're stepping on my tongs. that's all right. i'll get them."

"houston, 15."
"and, houston, that sample bag that i put the fragments in that i memtioned earlier, that i found in the bottom of that small crater?"
roger.
"hey, that looks black. wouldn't you say that's black?"
go ahead.
"dave, is that time okay?"
"go ahead, houston."

they want to get that?
"that would be a good deal, wouldn't it?"

"and, tony, a lot of this soil is coming out from about 6 - 6 inches down - -"
confirm that.
"get the stereopair on, i think."
"won't win any world's record, but - okay - okay, tony. this thing, when it wound up, i - i tried to - it got away from me, and it tore just a little bit, but i think we'll be able to get it in the hag. up at the upper part. didn't wind up like a - a window shade."
"yeah, that's what i'm doing. oh 02 01 56 cmp i've got you. you were behind me."

"roger. thank you. 05 20 35 15 lmp-in houston, how do you read the lmp?"
"okay. and, commander, if you can send one of your subordinates over there to terminate the battery charge, we'd appreciate it."
"okay, i'm all set here, too."

"good morning, houston. how are you?"
"is it time to get up yet, bob?"
understand.
"okay, jim. thank you. and that's all we have down here for the time being. i've been reading the apollo 15 status report that's put out every 2 hours. what's normally several pages is just a page today. and - with very few words on it, the most prominent one being the word nominal, the meaning of which i'm going to look up as soon as i get off this shift. 02 02 11 39 imp very good."
mark.
"i might take a look at that, too. *** to argue with success, but i need that dexterity today. bob, i don't know if you caught it yesterday - a little interesting facet of the whole two-eva exercise was the fact that i've already worn - -"
- - about 10 or - 10 percent boulder cover.
okay. make that 2-1/2.
"11, houston. roger, nell. 8-1/2, 7, and 8 for your crew status."
"good. *** there, babe."
"eagle, houston. could you give us a hack on the time that you switched to lm power and also verify that we're on glycol pump 1. over."
"oh, i'm sure it will."
"you got lo flow. lo flow mode, i should say. 05 22 13 ]5 lmp-lm okay, my pga diverter valve is vertical."
hold the brush a minute and stand there. it did come off.

"and, houstcn marks 1 minute, and you've got good pumps."
"i - we read you, charlie. we want you to go through a little procedure here to essentially get you back to a start position. we want you to go to slew on the s-b_d. check both s-band circuit breakers on 11 and 16. select pitch of minus 75 and maw of minus 12: wait 30 seconds and then go to an acquisition and we'll have some angles for yo_. 03 22 33 47 lr_ okay, that's where we are."

"hey, we're going to have to rush."
"oh, yes."
two marks. 04 00 57 59 _ that's it.

excuse me. move forward just a little. and i'll get your bag. here you go.

"they got suited and took their helmets and gloves with them over in the lm - took their helmets and gloves with them over to lm, and they said they were going to send the back. but i don't think they ever did. we all got busy, and so they've still got them over there somewhere."
"let them watch the systems and you do the flying, which is the way it ought to be. 04 o0 21 43 (clanking)"
oh. (laughter)
... that was the way we had stowed them ...

it's noticeably more.
roger. why do you think i need to move the radar? (t nq)
"oh, yes. yes, you can't sleep too well; all you got was ..."
okay. we'll do that.
"al, we've got your angles and you can torque them."
"okay, okay. here we go."
"oh - hang on. hang on, there we go. this rover is super."
"no, by golly, there are lineaments down there all over the place, going - well, northeast - yes, northeast, southwest. see it? right up on the ridge. right along all the ..., by golly. look at that."
okay.
so that gives us about - 05 14 14 55 cdp go ahead.

"and, houston, we're just looking at you out our window here. looks like there's a circulation of clouds that just moved east of houston over the gulf and florida area. did that have any rain ir_ it this morning?"
something else? ... tight enough?
"yes. hey, do it once - once - let me move the gnomon here. we'll - they can reconstruct that. take another swath over here so -"

okay.
"okay; we copy that. we think it's probably normal, but we'll look into it real closely. sounds to me like the endeavour has a few plumbers aboard as well as experts in other things."
roger.
okay; we'll need an emu check before you drive off.
"okay, let me get these in a bag here."
he's holding attitude. it'll give us a new maneuver here.
what looked like fragments is just - -
"well, there's no choice, right now. let me see if these little ones will fit in there. stand by. i want to put this one in there, too."
okay.
"okay, it's level, but the sun reading is 0 - 064-1/2. is that okay, houston?"
bravo 1.
right.
it's like a three-man gemini. there was no room in there. 07 22 15 38 ibip i don't see how y'all did it.
"yes, we're at the same sun angle, and there's no doubt about it from tac_uet on up to mel something or other, there's a group of small rilles in there, and those rilles have got ejected material_ around and up and over the rilles. and not - not impact- type ejecta. it's got to be a volcanic ejecta of some kind up and around there. it's a dark broom - a darker brown, than the tan of serenitatis."
okay.
you're more than 15. 05 14 12 03 l_cp okay?
"okay, stand by. i've - let's see - okay. okay, i need your numbers then. noun 20."
"man, that thing is - their prediction is right on this."
"got it. we've got it. wait a second; let me clear a nice little room here for it. , confidentia _. 04 22 54 _4 lmp say, are we going to jettison this garbaze bag at the end of this eva, pete? oh ?2 54 46 cdr yes, sir."
hear it?
"okay. as you move off, pete, every once in a while, i can see some white; but, most of the time - hey, you kicked over a rock that had a white bottom - quite a bit different than the top. right behind you; you might - you might want to take a picture of that. it's quite a bit dif- ferent than those others."
"okay. cb i_mpower-2, main b, open; cb lm power-l, main a, open; cb eps sensor signal, main b, open. stand by 1, jack."
"they didn't seem to have any particular shape, except that they were elongate in the direction of the rille and i didn't notice any particular any - any buildup around the - the mountain. in fact, in this particular sun angle, which is rather low, i didn't really see much elevation around them. so, i assume that they're depres- sional, kind of collapsed features, rather than buildup features of positive relief."
roger. we're standing by.
there you go. it works!
"plss antenna, eva."
"mapping camera, on, to off."
"yeah, i recommend they enjoy it as much as we did. i'm sure they will, because, i tell you, we really have - we really have had a lot of sights to see. i'll admit that, in a lot of cases, we worked hard, and - and i suppose the people on the ground were able to tell that. but we got all the support in the world from the - mcc-houston. i - i mean, i could tell, from every decision that came up from the ground, that there had been a lot of work put into it, and all around the country that there were a lot of wheels turning and people working late hours and solving these problems. and i'm just really happy that ken, charlie, and myself got to do this. and i think it's a wonderful experience."
"did you get your watch started on time, jimmer?"
"how does it look, charlie?"
yes. that lunar landmark; you knew you had to get that out sooner or later.
"houston, casper. roger. i'll need a state vector. how soon do you expect to have one?"
it's still bad going into the sun - out of the sun s_ndinto the sun. but it's pretty good the way we're going right now.
didn't happen on my watch.
"okay, ron, we know what you're trying to do, and we appreciate the tv show. we're looking - we're sorry to see you go, but we'd like to terminate."
"okay, jack. the moon _ent through that time at 32 degrees on the l_d."

and i'll get the sleeping pills.

i'll get the tg and clean up the rover.

do you want to do this before we unlock it?
we got both rates nulling at the same time.
"yes. suit fan, off."
flow's good in suit gas diverter.

yes. that's good. you're just coming in in orb rate.
"yeah, that's good."
"01d, you know that has got to be old, old, old, old!"
yes.
"okay, i'm gonna move the camera up and there is a flat surface which is now just about on the center _, of my picture, and it's pointing away from me. this is the one we can see it peeling off of."
"and, houston, we - okay, we have engine thrust and commanded thrust, full-scale high."
"(laughter) oh, come on now. they've only got one pair, too, i think. unless both of them ended up over there."
get this side?
"jim, this is houston. 05 05 15 33 imp-eva go ahead."
"here it is, right here. uplink to - uplink to csm ... i don't understand this at all .... do a p52 on the back side, and we've done that; stereostrips here ... getting all lost; ... dse; update to csm; map update rev 45, tei 45 pad. ... looking right at them. they always ..."
"okay, bearing is llb, and we're at .6."
gdc aline.
okay. in work.
"yeah, i'm positive, unless they got a cap on, they're empty. okay, tony, we fou_id them."
"it almost looks like that - in the northwest quarter of marginis, and it's about - let's see, i'm guessing - 100-kilometer size, probably."
"not any large ones. there are a couple of sm_ller disturbances. well, there's one maybe 300 miles north of cuba, but it doesn't look cyclonic."
it's on the side of a hill; that's a problem out here. confidentiaw
that's verified. auto and power.
okay. what's the tunnel now?
"make sure you take your timer down, jim, before we start the burn."
got them? okay. your velcro is tidied.
"hello, apollo ll. houston. sorry to bother you, but we'd like to have you do a verb 34 to get the noun 65 off of there. over. apollo 11 air-to-ground voice transcri?rlon (goss net 1) tape 104/1 rest period - no communications apollo 11 air-to-ground voice transcription (goss net 1) tape 105/1 rest period - no communications apollo 11 air-t0-ground voice transcription (goss net l) tape lo6/1 rest period - no communications apollo 11 air-to-ground voice transcription (goss n_ 1) tape 107/1 rest period - no communications apollo 11 air-to-ground voice transcription (goss net 1) tape 108/1 rest period - no communications apollo 11 air-t0-ground voice transcription (goss net l) tape 109/1 rest period - no c059_u'nications apollo 11 air-to-grou_d voice tp_i_,criflion (goss net 1) tape 110/1"
okay. we apparently v in our struggles up here inadvertently hit the waste water to dump and it's back in relief now. that dump is terminated; we have 30 percent waste water.
okay.
it should be open. that - there's no question about that. it should be open.
"pete has the checklist, dick."
okay.
"i'll look around, jack. i was just trying to get a check on the moon, again, to see if those angles were indeed true, and we got the moon back again and centered."
thruster's going.
okay. tape146/2
(laughter) okay.
i say our range to casper is about 0.7 of a mile.
that's affirm.
"and, charlie, after dusting the lcru there, you'll have to tear off one of those thermal blankets and put it over the control panel on the lcru."
i -
"okay, the first one is at 96:34."
okay.
"maybe last night, which i think you got something this morning."
okay.
"okay. we start on 2-1, right?"
"al, did you get some off the far side - of that?"
give us a few minutes here and we'll - get operational.
that's right.
there. the right one went easy - i think they're all really getting -
"that's in, locked, locked; cover's coming up."
"- - and we're gonna be pressed just to make that thing. that's what i was gonna suggest. good plan. and i'll catch 52 the next time we get in the dark. the platform is - obviously knows where it is. so, we'll go ahead and get this north oblique in here, and i'm gonna have a - it looks like that may be a tight one, too - just to get to it. but i'll - we'll get there, if we have to use the higher rate."
"display/engine override//logic. 05 22 28 13 lme okay, it's closed. descent engine override, open - -"
"and, geno, you had 3851 feet per second going through the crossover."
"when it comes up flow, the h2 banks up there like crazy. looks like the simulator. the 02 isn't like the simulator. yes, it gets up there real slow. that old h2 - stand by for another master alarm. it banked up there like nothing flat. okay. they're all back down to - -"
...
"are you happy with this, jack? let me ... 63."
long can.
"roger, 15. we're ready to copy."
"_nd, jack, what do you see in the way of boalders coming down to the base of the sculptured hills in terms of sampling opportunities at station 8 and in terms of any boulder tracks that we might - might lead down the boulders that might juat possibly be accessible at station 8."
read the integrity checks for me. okay?
good gosh! was that a - ... aspect ratio of that little thing.
"roger. t. is 125:26:15.47. lg 04 22 41 49 cml° okay, that is 25:26:15.47."
let me watch that pressure a minute. well: it looks like it's stable at five. okay.
it sure is.
still got 20 percent more to go.
"we've still got a lm update, but we strongly recommend that you _d jack work as hard as you can sleeping for about the next 5 hours. fred can handle it. 05 08 _6 42 cdr okay. that's what we']l do. we'll put fred on watch here, and jack and i will take it easy, and if fred copies the lm update, well, then we'll all start from fresh in the morning. 05 ()8/6 56 cc you bet."
turned them on 3 minutes early.
- - they're there somewhere.
"hey, jim, we got about a b-degree roll command in. okay, enter, b60 minus 01720 enter; b67 is coming up, and i'm starting the clock - i mean the camera. okay, we're out at 12,000, john. go at 9. coming down at 182; a little steep. okay, well, we're gonna be right on. it's just about right on, maybe l0 feet; lo,o00 feet. stand by. p64 at 8200. pro."
"okay, that's good. then we'll take it with the 80."
"okay. over here - let's see, forward do$_ valve, open now."
yes. it's been opened.
"okay, thank you. looks good up here. okay, system asm feed number 2, open. 07 03 28 44 _p open and gray."
yeah. 10 07 42 57 cml° ...
yes.
roger.
... the first one.
"locked. 03 l0 41 12 i24p dead band, max."
okay. it's off. let me fill it.
roger.
yeah. i don't want to run into those holes.
leva's not locked though. you'll have to rotate your helmet after i get the leva locked.
that's affir_ative. 05 04 24 32 c_p okay. i can do that and eat at the same time.
yeah ....
"okay, houston. orion says that they have already selected the secondary."
...
"apollo 16, houston."
"okay. is there any way the surgeon can tell which lead needs to be fixed or which two leads, because the ... of all those things come in packages of twos, you know?"
"no, it's good. our curve 's in."
this ... flat piece we're coming up on. ob l0 50 30 lmp no.
"okay, the central pin looks flush, stu."
okay. turn around.
yes.
"yes, me too. okay; let me know when you are up."
"okay, can you hear a erossfeed on it?"
roger. latitude 00.691 - that would be plus 00.691 - and longitude over 2 is plus 11.713. the altitude is minus 1.44 nautical miles. over.
"cabin repress valve, close."
"you got to pull it away, charlie."
especially me. tape8o/6
15. you have a go to proceed to the landmark observation attitude.
"boy, i'll tell you - i really had to pull. i pulled harder than i like to in a pressure suit."
"al, you haven'z taken a pan, have you?"
80 degrees -
yes; can't even see the horizon.
ail right.
"houston, 15. go ahead."
"moved, didn't it?"
"tranquility, houston. request rendezvous radar breakers in about now."
roger.
"let me know when you're finished - - _. 05 00 41 49 cdr-eva okay, i'm reading 38 on my gage. flags are clear, and i'm reading 75 percent."
okay. thank you.
okay.
"yes, trying to move ... we've got another 5 minutes to go. anyway, we've used -"
"houston, america. go ahead."
"okay, jack. bring a-4 on; stop the pitch rate."
"well, there are, indeed, little particles flying along with us."
yeah.
"and, dave, while - while you're firing them off there, does the trafficability look pretty good? 04 l0 54 12 cdr-seva yes, it sure does, joe. it'll be - the largest fragment i can see right now on the surface is _-_ probably about 6 to 8 inches; however, inside the walls of pluton, there are some pretty big chunks."
"very striking color. it would be more of an orange- red, really, with brown subduing it. it's not - obviously not crimson or anything like that."
you maneuvered a bit on that one.
"are you 5.1, also? 05 22 16 34 lmp-/2/ coming down about 5."
(laughter) there's no way you can avoid sleeping.
"okay, i heard you through ac inverter 2, ac bus 1 to on, and you were cut out by noise. go ahead."
roger. - -
okay. 06 23 21 b4 lmp-eva as well as the - solar wind.
roger. level sense arm.
"well, i see we've had visitors again. 04 19 03 26 i_p yes."
"11, houston. buzz, you still looking for that 90-degree bracket? over."
what time's ]los?
"... where's your tv? charlie, fix this thing for me."
"aquarius, houston."
roger.
hello there.
(n_...l.ng)
"make sure i'm in audio/tone back here, but i don't think it makes any difference."
"towards the moon, ken."
okay. ready for it.
- - ... be back behind-
... on at 19.
5.1; 094/5.1.
"okay. that sounds very good. it's sort of like the contrast between the lunar surface response and - the oceans being more like that, i guess, and the - between the lunar surface and terrestrial land surfaces."
yeah. 03 23 i0 38 cdr there you go.
you sound real good. loud and clear.
here ...
"he's got to go up like that. but with our mechanics, it may not do an_thing."
"yeah, you apparently painted a pretty picture for them. they like you. 05 l0 19 36 l_ip-lm okay."
po0 and accept.
okay. _.
roger.
"while you're eating there, i'll tell you a little ... news. the astros have ... they are tied for first place in the division."
"yes. that's pretty deep. pretty deep. i_-eva yes, it is."
"okay. very good. thank you, sir. okay, and then what do we do about this - can we do our ptc refsmmat change at the same time we're in this attitude?"
"yes, sir."
ail right.
"okay, houston. we're in the general area of the planned alsep deployment now - on the chart, it's in a depression, and i think we'll move on a little closer to doublet to give it a zhigher elevation. 0_ 19 52 18 cc roger. you're visible from - about the armpits up, right now."
copy that. soil sample?
"ah, sure can. you bet you. i think the best way to do it is with the 250 lens on the hasselblad."
"jim. put on mag kilo kilo on that camera, please. 06 03 ll 43 i24p-eva i was wondering, is dave going to need his camera out there?"
"what am i supposed to do, stand - well -"
"oh, yes. that's going to be easy to pull out. okay; let's see if i got everything in here. 06 23 00 35 ia{p-eva you ready for me to go to the alsep? houston, do you read? *** do you read me?"
"houston, america. how are our rates looking?"
okay. rock solid. thirty seconds.
these bags come open - the scbs come open when you don't want them to and they - you can't get them open when you want them to.
okay.
one of them will go - -
"i'll tell you what's the matter, that thing - you're getting - getting friction. wait, wait. hold her tight."
"yes, steno ought to be at - right at your 9 o'clock there, gene."
... verify.
"sure, look at it."
"a_reyou? 00 01 27 09 i2_p well, i'm not when i look out the window, but i'm still - i'm a little bit disoriented in direction. l co.nfid e l ayl"
there they come.
another doublet there on the left.
roger. looks like you're just passing a little bit to the west of grimaldi now. you concur with that? about right over riccioli?
"yes, i saw that."
"hello, houston through honeysuckle ov - -"
"clear. now i need a range, which happens to be 186."
"yes. you can hold there, and i'll hold, too. lmm-eva that seems like a little easier."
...
beautiful.
roger. 20:39.
roger. thank you.
mark. you have it now.
... time ...
"roger. and you hardly got any dust on you, but i'm going to do you a favor and dust you off."
"go ahead, houston; this is america."
"six miles, dick."
okay.
okay.
"okay, closed."
"go atlead, 11."
"okay. we copy that. okay, while we're filling in some here, you might want to know this, jack. your sunset and sunrise times in the launch checklist are all off by 8 - approximately 8 minutes and 30 seconds. that every - sunset and sunrise will occur about 8 minutes and 30 seconds sooner than in the - in the launch checklist. that's an ap- proximate number. iaip okay, we got you."
could sure see a flash.
"houston, do you read? gene, do you read me?"
"- - amps on bat 2, dave?"
two clocks that say it's 2 minutes.
"holding - holding the vertical, and it's holding right on. you're at 3000 feet, at 3 feet a second. 2800 feet."
"we've got to get headed west for a nav update, john."
look at that. see that?
"17, houston. we're copying cabin press of 5.9 this time."
"okay, stand by."
it's 1051 and 36276.
ro - roger. apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription
good.
that good enough?
"36,000 feet. well, but they'll - they'll update your state vector."
okay. let's try once more.
"go ahead, columbia. oh 12 11 33 cmp roger. stars 43 and 44: star angle difference (colum_[a) 4 balls 1, noun 93 p2us 000 - - 0h 12 11 14 lmp audio circuit breaker closed."
is that where you want it?
"okay. operate is verified in standby, and recorder is on."
"okay. we'll go clockwise with it. we're clock- wise, and no change."
"hey, gene, we appreciate all the data. we were just trying to make the data fit the curve; you know the old trick."
the -
"well, this is so level right here, jack, i'm going to just park it - -"
roger. stand by 1°
"there's some. 06 01 37 44 _4p-eva okay. 06 0t 37 50 _4p-eva yeah, they're rocks all right. going in bag 335, three little ones, tony."
okay. cdr-eya - - there you are. they're not rammed.
"oh, 8 degrees or so?"
okay. we sure understand. and just pick a site 50 meters north and we'll call that l0 prime.
"okay, orioa. this is houston. i have a - a p27 for you, one for refsmmat and the other's your state vector. over."
mars. there's canopus.
yes. we see it at the top of the screen.
roger.
i guess right straight up is the best way to go.
okay.
it is?
"i was afraid you were going to get too personal there, for a minute. (laughter)"
okay.
it's there.
yes.
...
doing all right?
get a little faster here.
do you intend ignoring that question? are you a naive ...?
"al, i think you've had enough."
thank you.
let's get this - this fragment here - or a bunch of these little ones i guess. tape93/48
"yes - yes, it's in the hole. cdr-l_ okay. wrist cover on. l_p-lm wrist cover's on. cdr-i_4 and my pga is going to start biting here if we don't get going. lmp-_ yes. okay - okay - plss to the - -"
okay.
what time is it? how much time we got for the burn?
yes.
"okay, karl. just a couple of general observations _ on crisium while we're coming up on it. proclus coming up from the east is really spectacular, you can very distinctly see the - the difference in the - in the color of the albedo in the excluded zone of proclus, and as you're coming up across crisium with proclus ahead, you can see the ray pattern very distinct - extending out across crisium - and follow the ray patterns almost as far as you like. and the excluded zone in the - in the ray pattern is just very distinct at this point."
good night.
"okay, understand auto and you go_ the selec_ %o cabin? 07 03 08 i0 lmp-lm yes, gas __ntv_m_,_pushed to cabz]( and _,_e""__'__ryin_ the pgas now."
roger. out.
okay. coming up on 57. it should be 20.5.
there's sample bag 560.
"okay, that's the dust again. now, the bag's in the way. let me get the bag out."
that should do her. i think we've fixed it. i had the hoses in n_ storage box.
"_ich one is that, gordo?"
"okay, i'm up."
"houston, america. we'll pick up the star sextant check and set the dap when we're in attitude."
that's right.
"okay, al. thank you."
mode select is pgi_s.
okay.
"which one? the gold visor? no, he said his sun- shade is sticking halfway down, but his gold visor's not."
"yes, give me the bag. i'll fill it up, too. dig a little light trench in there, amd we'll - i got - i got a feeling that dr. schmitt's going to win his bet. not that part, get another part. not where we picked the rock up, right - right in front of it. okay, that's good. just - hit the - spot, too."
okay. we copy.
"(laughter) 03 il.06 51 cml° i - if i'm in your way, just ... it down."
"yes, sure is."
"okay, got that."
you ... (eagle)
stand by for gimbal motors. 03 06 38 52 cml° i thought i just gave you one.
just want to make sure with all the changes around in this 509 that we hadn't overlooked one.
roger. out.
yes. i guess they are.
...
you want a mark at 2:50?
"they - houston - or gordo, ron here."
i don't know. i can't - i've got this visor stuck down and can't see what it is. got a lot of dirt on it.
and gene will be on biomed shortly.
"okay. let me get it. let me get it. you sure do. that's a good one, too. here. wait a min- ute. watch your hand."
"yes. i ... done that, too."
okay; let's get some - -
"no, they're not. i took them out and put them on you."
"bob, the gray material that is adjacent to the red material is in at 5 - how would i say 510."
we are not on vox.
"thank you very mucl, owen. i think my yard could use some water."
roger; and we're marking. we want you to proceed towards checkpoint number 1. your general heading is 160 at 1.9 clicks and this may take you down be- _. tween salyut and index craters.
getting it. that a boy. there. 06 02 08 49 k_ip-eva should have left the rake on.
"okay. now, next, at about 105:05, there's a ""verb 48."" that should be moved up to 105, and below that, the ""verb 49 maneuver"" should be moved up, too."
"roger. copy. correct, and one last comment; we will not be passing you up a t_f-9 - tei-19 pad at this time."
"no, it's still three sections long, and we could put it in the sleep restraint. it just seemed like a convenient place to stick it in the bag over there to keep it tied down well."
i say our range to casper is about 0.7 mile.
"hey, when fido gets a good hack on our trajectory, will you let us know?"
really?
plus 3. t
okay.
"it's holding inside the cabin. forgot to trigger it. i'll have - well, hell, it's down below the go mark. it can't be. 00 02 20 57 cml° what?"
"hello, apollo 11. houston. how do you read now? over."
hold it a minute. hold itl let me get a bag.
what - what do you want me to do with the neutron flux?
"thank you. okay. it is off, as a matter of fact. shall i turn it on now?"
"under ""!vt to csm,"" delete step 1."
- - you got about 9 minutes until you have to leave.
the ... short (laughter) scb. okay.
okay. we've got cb 5 and 80.
okay. it says here's this second thing that goes in there. remember you copied last night. 05 02 03 58 i24p-lm okay.
roger. understand. t. is good. zg
"go ahead, jack."
okay. *** there you ge.
"darn it, dick, you're unreadable. say again."
don't fall over.
"well, that was a good suggestion. i had forgotten all about that song. that's a good one."
okay. let's do - -
you are just a little tiny black dot to the un- aided eye.
okay. and the penetrometer drum.
"challenger, we've got those angles here on the ground, for both spacecraft."
there you go.
roger. understand.
roger.
"okay. now the sps cue card. let me kncw when you're ready to copy. 08 05 46 16 c_ okay, don. go ahead. and why don't you give me an outline of what is first, so i have some idea of what to do, and then i'll work on the card. we can go back and do it in detail. 08 05 h6 24 cc okay. first of all, about a third of the way down the page, we've got a note on the - on _ne p'ios operation for tei, and then we've _ot a couple or three words to add down about nine lines from the bottom on the gimbal trim and veri_ manual thrust vector control. and we're gonna say there, ""except yaw."" and seven lines from the bottom, we're _oing to have you open the pitch 2 and yaw 2 battery b e_rcuit breakers to keep the secondary system from getting an - or sensing an overcurrent and shutting itself down. and on the back of the card, we're going to reelose those two circuit breakers after the delta-v thrust stop. 08 05 47 13 c_ okay. is there some reason you think that we need that added protection this _ime? tape129/7 08 05 h7 19 cc i guess i-_'s just a feeling that if you ge_ into te t and you lose the primary system and you're on the secondary system, you don't want the secondary system to - to sense an overcurrent and shut down. and we're gonna pull these circuit breakers to make sure that that control system continues to function. 08 05 47 hl cmp okay. that's always the case. i just wondered if there was some reason that you were suspicious that might be more appropriate thing to say this time. 08 05 h7 51 cc legative. we don't have any - axly evidence that says that's likely %o happen or any more likely to happen. 08 05 48 06 cl{p ail right. is that the - that's the context of the changes?"
copy that.
"no, i don't think north american even - i think they think it was just great, but i don't know if i'd ever go to bethpage if i were you."
"up on panel 351, water & glycol tanks pressure regulator, dff."
that's right.
roger.
we'll have to get it next time.
"okay. the - oh, in the other one up in that area, ron, and i assume you - you've put that outlet bag over the cabin fans - and we wouldn't want you to fool with that at all, because it's probably all full of dirt and everything - but if you didn't, then the outlet to the cabin fan area might be a potential place."
i want to get this - -
"not that much trouble, karl."
"okay, the repress 02 is about 865."
"get your picture, jack?"
"that was interesting. bob, about 2 inches below the surface here, you ran into that very - that blue-gray material down there and it just - it's in little clods, and it breaks apart in your hands."
roger.
"16, we'll handle the ommis m-._tilwe're ready to _io to the high gain, and we'll tell you when to gc 1o high gain at the angles we lust gave you."
this is houston. go ahead. reading you weakly.
okay. we copy that. we'd like to get the usual dusting here. up front.
"go ahead, houston. oh 04 50 15 cc jim, regarding your number 2 battery, we think that it's probably a sensor failure, a temperature sensor failure that's caused this alarm, rather than an actual overtemp of the battery; the rea- son being that we haven't seen any higher temper- atures in the glycol loop. we expect to put the battery back on about 101 hours. that'll be about 10 minutes, and then we'll look at it some more there. over."
"okay, pgns was minus 1.1, o, and minus 1.1. ags was minus 1.5, o, and minus b.0. cs - csm, plus 1.5, minus .2, plus 1.9. and we burned the pgns solution to o.1 and .2. 07 05 46 ob cc thank you, dave, that's fine. appreciate it."
"well, depending on your trafficability."
"gordo, we need voice, range when you can get it."
"okay, he's coming along. (colmmza)"
roger. the map shows an indication maybe there might be a secondary there.
"(laughter) oh, you do?"
"okay, and we can get our helmets off. lmip-lm if i can ever get unsuited. oh, this is funny. (laughter) that's my hand. let me try the other one,"
roger.
we got - we got some pictures of earthrise as we were climbing out. i bet they're really spectacular.
"hello there, america. we hear you talking. 03 14 37 32 _ auto and narrow. yes, auto and narrow."
"apollo 11, houston. vhf check on simplex alfa. over."
"(laughter) cdr-_ get my gauntlet donned. and that's dirt protecting dirt. lmp-_ don't throw down a gauntlet, gene."
"okay, we're at 234/2.5."
"okay, houston, that was a pretty good bang."
"- - you're a - -1most a - just a crescent earth, just a very sliver out there. and i tell you, we can hardly wait. i know we got a couple of things to do before we get there, but we're looking for- ward to it."
i am out of film anyway.
"orion, we're finished with your computer."
i thought it was about time we crossed. thank you.
i don't think it will be a very big deal.
"how you doing over there, albert?"
"okay, understand. you want to slip that down to 120:16."
"yes, just behind you is one of those fresh craters, too, with a lot of glass in it."

i'd believe that.
"very good, thank you."
"it's pretty badly shattered, tony, so i don't know whether it's going to stay together - i don't know whether it's gonna stay together or not."

very soft on the rim.
"oh, very good. we're i_ressing right on down."

okay.
yes.
"okay, and this is a real-time flight plan change. this real time right here, and right now if you'll go mapping camera cover, open, and mapping camera, extend, and give us a _,awk, we'll time the extend time on it, please."
good show. i told them you were.
"bob, i have a feeling that whatever darkens the - 0oh, there's a beautiful little glass-lined crater, pit bottom crater - whatever darkens the light mantle is not a - a one-time-only mantling of darker material. it's something that happens over a period of time, continually, because craters of all sizes and apparent degradation are dark - darkened and there are lighter craters that are light to varying degrees, there seems to be a continuing - continuum of albedo change."
okay.

roger. i'll put a mark here and mark it on my map so you can look at it preflight - postflight.
and 12 frames per second.
seems like that other fellow is hung up on that other flight for some reason or another.
"houston, america."
"okay. we didn't read that, except no sep."
"and, houston. hadley base, here. anytime you want to discuss the landing and our position, why, i guess we've got supper cooked, and we're ready."
"well, if they don't want us to stop here, i guess we leave."
"how about another range check when you get a chance to, please."
okay. suit press circuit breaker coming closed.
okay. there you go.
that's right. yes.
while we're waiting here - i decided to sleep last night without being tied down or anything. so i slept in the old - what do you call them in the navy? -

"the view of the moon that we've been having recently is really spectacular. it fills about three-quarters of the hatch window, and of course, we can see the entire circumference, even though part of it is in complete shadow and part of it's in earthshine. it's a view worth the price of the trip.

thank you.
how did i do that?
"okay, 380."

"roger, dave. interesting."
"well, let's see, i guess i'm supposed to -"
"and the panel 5 instrumentation science equipment seb circuit breakers are coming open. two are open. ron, you may want to watch that. yes."
"aquarius, houston. go."
sure.
not a bad idea.
"you do want to shave between now and then? 03 15 38 05 _ yes, i guess. maybe you ought to - take a couple of pictures."
"okay, i'll turn it on,"
okay.
"no, i just feel like my suit is pressurizing more. what are you guys looking at down there on the ground?"
"okay. now it says ""front"" - that's all of a-2. it says, ""front of a-3 - a-6, core stem in bag."" and we'll leave it where it is."

"yes.... the best. man, i'm pulling so many marks, i don't know what to do with them all."
"roger. and at 00:42, and i don't see why you can't do this one early either, mapping camera/ laser altimeter cover, open; mapping cai_era, extend."
"yes, sir. we heard that. good. i guess i was able to find 102 at 0.1"
okay. thank you.
"no, it's still leaking, karl; pretty good rate."

that's affirmative.
look at that rock right in front of us. it looks like a contact between a blue and a gray.
"try to find that checklist ... it's part of the requirement .... do. you're going to have to punch all these goddam switches, pardner."
"and, 15, let's hold a couple of minutes while we check some data on the sim bay and then we'll go to the mocr one more time. and we'll be back with you in final status, i hope."
"obs [sic] going to pga, and i'll turn around and let you."
... that's it. push it in.
"okay, houston. how do you read us in the high gain?"
and the surface is a little bit lighter - the regolith. blocks are very angular.
"okay. and then got some more steps here, as soon as i find them. okay. lunar sounder operate switch to standby. that's a verify. then recorder, on."
"charlie, houston."
"what are you waiting for, a word from them?"
"okay, ron. you're about 2 minutes from t-start time, but again bias your t-start time with re- spect to the crater eratosthenes."
okay. good show.

we've got to carry the secs up.
yes.

"al, you going to monitor comm? i'm going to get off the headset here."
"al, do you have any comments on the footpad inter- action with the surface?"
okay.
we're for that.
"17, houston."
"okay, bob. first - first break i have i'll change - have to change those sensors. i - i needed to put that salve on and i guess - that's probably the same problem as on the way out."
head you loud and clear.
"and i've gone back - okay, i've gone back to average now and ... pitch up."
"that's okay, john. we - we read 35 percent down here."
"that's a good idea. i think i'll do that, too."
"okay, you're right. i looked down at the flight plan and saw a reacq and narrow. and then i went back to manual. i - i may have had it in narrow all along. thank you."
some - something on here has reset the range. it's -
this is what i sampled at - -

roger. we've got his heartbeat way up.
"okay, we got tico. and the prime recovery ship - prime chopper - is recovery. the backup is swim, and we've got rescue 1 samoa, downrange."
yeah.
"roger. looking at the flight plan, ron, you're coming up on selecting omni bravo and setting up the high gain and pow - powering it off; and get- ting ready for the lunar sounder receive only section here."
"it's a tossup, cdr. take your pick, i guess, really."
"15, houston. have a lunar eclipse photo pad on your flight plan, page 384, when you're ready."
what's that?
"and the target point that was in the pgns was right up where we all had expected it to be about halfway between here and what we're calling the rim of camelot. we can't see into camelot; we can just see the rim of it. it's several - oh, at least 200 meters - 2 to 300 meters up there, i expect."
what?
i'll cut it off for him. 07 22 03 4h c_¢p i tell you what. i'm - i'm about ready to invoke our privilege and tell them that we didn't have - we didn't keep track of the meal last night. just to - just to tweak them.

"hello, houston."
how about that.
"roger. advise, we are not locking up on your high bit rate, so you can go back low bit rate. over."
"go ahead, l_qual,'[as."
"okay. thank you, sir."
"well, we're - bob, we're almost ready to park."
"okay, can you pull it out a little bit, jim?"
okay.
"and in that case - yes, m_ map doesn't go up that way, either, so - or the one i have out."
mark.
"it's just bad, that's all."
ice crystals.
hey. jlj confid 07 04 46 b4 cdr it's unreal.
"that's affirmative. and now we'd like you to delete all the steps below that lift-off time, from the a/t-3 data star info box through the verb 32 after the last - after for the remaining data stars and after last star. in other words, just delete all between the box and up to circuit breaker a0t lamp, open. and, of course, they'll be no p22 time, over. cdr-ia_ okay. delete all the data star information be- tween the start of that box and after last star verb 34 enter, 00 enter."

we're in 3. i want that to be right.
"apollo ll, apollo ll, this is houston. we are reading you weakly. go ahead. over."
we're - we're waiting ...
"okay. copy that. and you guys may still have your visors up. we can't tell, but you might be better off with them down, if you've forgotten they they're up."
okay. just as soon as we get ken on comm.
yes.
drop that baby.
"gcod readback. and now i'm ready for the coelliptic. ,',tillyou give us hi bit rate first, charlie? 07 05 58 12 la,_-ii.i you got it. pafe 16 _!"
"okay. 07 03 h8 58 lmp i have a visual on him now, dave."
"okay, stand by 1. - 04 09 o1 59 cmp okay, houston; endeavour. go ahead."

"columbia, affirmative. and at the ti time, put your rendezvous radar transponder switch to operate. 05 01 07 05 cml_ all right. (columbia) 05 0] 07 06 cc and this 130 prime is the same one that you tracked prior to descent. over."
it's working.
"17, houston."
"and, then, you turn it back on at the re - where it says ""reset stop watch and start."" the time zero there - point. prior to that, turn it on. i'll remind you of it."
"good show. roger. cml° there's a white spot - yes, there's a white spot on the - like it might have been dust blowing or something, you know."
roger. now we'll skip all the way down to panel 306 where we want the mission timer to stop and the event timer to stop. over.
0ka_-.
that's right.
okay. rcs looks good; ... looks good - partial pressure co2 is its usual zero (laughter). got a couple of good winners in these two spacecraft. 04 ih 25 19 cdr okay. we're out at 35 000.
"how about that, loud applause, loud applause."
"okay. we copy that. what do you notice? iaip-eva it's - it's quite a bit more cohesive at - about the - feels about the same down to 3 centimeters out here, and then the cohesiveness goes up, so it's difficult to scrape with the rover sampler."
question number 3 in three parts. were you sur- prised at the rocks and other formations at the cayley site?
"bob, just in general, how is the spacecraft look- ing to you? pretty good, i hope."
"okay. we're at 228/3.0, and we're not -we're headed south and not quite on the - on the east rim."
"going to final comp on midcourse number 1, dick."
why don't you come over here?
"okay; we'll do that. perform ops checkout. re- port 0ps pressure to houston. stow ops on engine cover. stow plss. okay; this is my mine. stow plss hoses and upper straps. remove lower straps. clip straps together and d-ring together, name to name. remove yo-yo. stow on engine cover."

"okay. that dap load, fred-o, is 31120. over."
"hey - hey, bob, i recommend that if we ever do this again they let me get off and pick the charge off when we want to deploy it. it really adds to the fatigue of the hands."
"okay. man, it's really soft here, tony, on the rim. you don't sink far, but when you walk on it, it gets very -"
yes. you can convince me of that. 06 o0 ll lb cdr-eva and it - we'll just have to take a look at it. we can get the pictures here. wonder from whence it came. if it - if it did hit there it was traveling - -
"roger, al. at least our direction is right."
"yeah. tape8i/i6 05 03 h8 45 lmp-eva okay; tony, the general terrain here is sloping off to the south - correction - yes, southwest at about i to 2 degrees, and the plum, excuse me, flag crater is on this - it's about to the top of this big ridge that slopes off generally to the southwest to the west of south ray. over."
i wonder if i ought to go ahead and put - take some descent batteries - -
"that's the one you want to turn over, charlie. 06 03 08 45 imp-eva this thing! gosh! i can't even budge it."
roger. go ahead.
"okay, i'll tell you what. let me jump up on the ladder and then you hand me that. okay?"
thank you.
"okay; 220:07, ""pan camera to standby; power, on; mono; exposure, normal."" go."

sounds pretty good to me.

"okay, a1 is bringing the s-band antenna around. positioning."
"well, okay. i was going out - out here around this big one."
"okay, jack. i'll make sure the experts hear that."
"roger. we're at that stage now where we're going to take some earth weather photography. if you're standing by, i have the camera aimed at the earth right now, and i'll give you a mark when i take this first picture."
"houston, aquarius."
okay; pan one up on spook crater.
"hey, here's a rock they'll be glad to see in houston."

i'm just trying to reestablish my references here for loi.
i think we're in good shape. everything's in the right place.
"okay. let's skip the ags and leave dt in its present situation, and i've got a few items i'd like to read off for return - over and above the nominal return items."
"0kay_ bob. the entire boost itself was not unlike what you've heard and what stu down there under- stands from the physical cues, and what have you. but the significant part of going at night is that as soon as we did have ignition down there in the bottom of the s-ic stack - even though i only have a little slit out of - oat of the rendezvous win- dow here, and ron doesn't have much of a hole in the boost protective cover out of the hatch window, we could definitely confirm ignition because we could see the reflected light on out through in front of us. it was by no means blinding, of course; we had the cockpit pretty well lit up. we - as soon as we lifted off, that light immedi- ately went behind us we came into just s-ic staging, and i had an opportunity to say, ""i told you so,"" to jack and ron. it was just like the great train wrecks of the past. i definitely could see the s-ii ignite; and, then, of course, the - i could see the significance of the reflec- tion through the window, besides all the other cues we had for ignition, very much like the s-ic lit up the windows on the stack. tower jett was pretty spectacular. i could see - the entire boost protective cover and some flames from somewhere - i'm not sure - maybe it was through the hole in the windows - but i could definitely see it. of course, it disappeared in short order. when the s-ii shut down, the delay time between shutdown there and the s-ivb igniting, the entire - the entire flame overtook us, and we literally through - flew through the s-ii flame when the s-ivb ignited, if you can imagine that. it's very similar to the titan staging, where you actually fly through the fireball on the s-ii. and that's something you never see - none of those things you ever see quite that way in daylight. on the s-iv, i could see - of course, once we got going, i couldn't see _y light from that plume again, but we could see the aps firing all the way through the burn. and once we got in orbit, as other guys have seen, you could see the aps firing at night without any dif- ficulty. one of the most significant things about tli is the fact that we, of course, started at night and flew right on up and through a sunrise, which in itself was a pretty spectacular thing. but, when you do it during a tli burn, it even adds a little bit of momentum to your effort."
"okay. that's in work now, hank."
okay.
"- - ..., inject."
"casper, you might try killing this roll at 208, which is your next roll attitude."
"yes. i guess so. in a minute, you're going to hear my kitchen timer ding, and that also says the earth is there."
"boy, i tell you, we go by that landing site awful fast."
"okay. on the zodiacal light: the - after the first 20-second frame, i got out of shut - sync on the shutter, and i fired off two more frames before i got down to - to 10 seconds. and then i went to 10 seconds and then 5 seconds, in order."
go ahead.
"actually, it's area echo 3 and 4, and it simply shows you the delta-v thrust switches there."
"well, a piece of the rail on the - on the aft - aft inboard side here - the rail isn't missing - it's just a piece of the flange - the rail that fits against the fender - but that doesn't hold any part of the fender on. i don't remember what i saw on the fender - the rails look pretty good, bob. and i had one of them completely on, and i just couldn't get the other one on. if i had known what that dust was, i would have tried an awful lot harder."
loose limits. okay. pc s 100.
we sure are. it's really outstanding.
"yeah, we copy. 04 02 31 55 lmp-i_m - jim, give us a call when you want us to go to aft omni."
"no, no - that's kind of nice to have."
...
"okay, going to accept."
"and, jack, we'd like you to leave the comm configuration as is until we get comm with the lm. .page 179"
okay.
wait a minute. circuit breaker (16) ecs: cabin repress to close.
"kitty hawk, houston. computer is yours."
and i'll get you all buttoned up. 04 18 48 56 i2_p looks fine. let me pull your visor down a little bit so you can - -
"yes, i slowed down in order to get my - my feeling here before we start sprinting."
"yeah, i know that."
"roger, jim. just said that we'd reverified that the pan camera is out of film, and you can power it down for the final time at your convenience."
houston; roger.
"houston, aquarius. are you calling?"
"- - and taped down again, huh?"
ought to be out of blackout.
"yes, it's number 7, huh? well, maybe it will fit."
"no. oh, boy. oh, boy."
yes. let me take -
"there's a good size one right over here by my footprint. actually, i took pan i where pan 2 should have been. okay, looking down into plum, tony, there is some cobbles and things on the inner rim. but they aren't very large - maybe 30 centimeters or so is the biggest."
mark cdr.
"okay, we're stationkeeping."
take pictures next rev.
"okay, houston. we're hard docked. cm2 okay, secs pyros - logic is coming off."
"okay, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 - 00 02 31 57 cmp/lmp okay, dsky blanks. 00 02 3i 59 cdr on schedule."
"well, if i get my - i'm going to have to go all the way around, i guess."
what do i want these tongs on for?
"but i tell you, the inner wall of camelot is - the inner wall of camelot to the east is cer- tainlyblocky."
okay. so i can't put the charge under my seat.
"descent 02, open."
"okay, logic l's going on, up; logic 2, on, _p."
a what?
"okay, say when you want the 620."
"good thought, al."
"columbia reading you loud and clear now, eagle. (columbia)"
"endeavour, this is houston. ready to tag up with you on the tei procedures. and, dave, i guess we're standing by for your rec_mendation. do you want to read through the additions you now have in your p40 sps thrusting checklist, or do you want us to go through the changes we want you to have there? it looks pretty much exactly like your tli maneuver. there're just two changes; there're two differences from that, i guess. over. r_"
"there we go .... 06 21 40 45 i_._p-eva okay, let me but your antenna up, john, if you get the chs_ce. 06 21 h0 51 cdr-eva okay."
"no, it worked - is that right?"
same thing we had yesterday.
and away we go.
rather than trying to chip. i2_yp-eva *** swing around down there?
"... is. how about swinging right and let me get a picture of that, john. with the rover and - a little bit more. we want a nominal station 10, so it's between the core - -"
"and i tried it both in manual and tvc and in the - in the - just with the thumbwheel, and i get the same response. there could be a switch here some- where but i - i swear i've checked them all, all i can. i guess i'll power them down."
"okay. that's - mine's verified. plss pump to on, right."
"aquarius, houston through madrid for a comm check. how do you read?"
roger.
"okay; first one, news concerning the water business. -- we've been having you check that valve. it looks to us now as though there's a blockage into the potable tank. you got obviously - a - far more water than you need to survive the rest of the mission, but it does mean that the waste tank will be filling up, and there is a possibility that it will start to vent about an hour or 2 before ei. it's been discussed down here and decided that the best way to do this is - far as not perturbing the vector too much - is to let it relieve overboard and not to do a dump ahead of time or turn the water boiler on ahead of time. in line with this, we might just verify that the pressure relief valves down on panel 352 - the water control panel, is in the relief position. it certainly should be there; it's just a - a little verification to make sure we're - we're not going wrong there. second, i - -"
"okay. wait, let me get over here and get set up."
that's fine. no problem.
- - 0122.7; the ags delta-vs are na.
"right. incidentally, i guess the guys in build- ing 6 - -"
we just saw that cover.
"24 is gienah. okay, take me to gienah."
"houston, america. looks like we're with you again."
"golly, you're here."
"john, you want to try to initialize vhf ranging while we're above it?"
"and i want a verb 76, enter, and i want a pro. there's a set of gimhal angles. 04 12 46 33 _p holy shit."
houston - -
average g is on.
okay. one correction - the red hose that's con- nected up right now to the lithium cartridge in the lmp's - wait a minute.
"you're down in the mud again, jack. it appears that some other circuit is feeding through on there with you."
"that ought to get your attention, shouldn't it?"
"okay, did you turn? retract?"
... check.
"okay. hey, listen. this is a pretty good size - i don't know how big this ray is, but the sample on the west edge of it (laughter). i don't under- stand how we're going to do that."
"okay, tony. we have - vhf antenna's on left, b is in duplex, and the ranging is on."
it was great.
twist it over ... try to hook it and ... material caught or something. take my hat off slowly. 07 04 09 07 cdr-i_ huh? 07 04 09 08 i_p-i2_ go - let's try it. 07 04 09 17 i2_p-lm that sounded like it was gonna go.
you really move better that way.
"16, we're - through hawaii now. and you're scheduled in this attitude through 7 hours or - at least, so no problem thermally, and you're not even due to do the p52 for another half hour, so you're plenty ahead."
"(humming) 21, alphard. okays that's down below sirius."
it's on.
stand by.
"17, houston. your times are nominal. level sense arm at 8 plus 36; s-ii shutdown at 9 plus 20. nominal times."
"hey, pete."
...
looks like somebody's been chipping up there. lmp-_ta looks like there's been a geologist here before ils.
"okay, i got two on and locked. come over and check mine when you get through."
"scs tvc, two of them, to rate command."
"roger, dave. and, just wanted to make sure you - you understood that we'd also prefer the mark on real time comm, as well."
"we're a little bit ahead of that, in fact. 54, 55 -"
what are they?
"yes, but it's a straight line. i don't know what the wander factor was, but i'm sure it was pretty high."
okay. do you want me to start out with the 500?
"yes, sir, i could if can - let's - let's see if -_' i can get the drill out."
"endeavour, houston."
"yeah, if you'll - if you can stand by just a minute, john. 06 23 20 0t cdr-eva charlie described this boulder right here to you. did you describe this one with the black streak running through it?"
"roger. dave, al, and jim, be advised you're go for transearth injection. set your sails for home. we're predicting good weather, a strong tailwind, and we'll be waiting on the dock. over."
"very fine. thank you. (laughter) one little minor problem, gordy, is that we're breathing so hard that the windows are fogging up on the inside for a change."
"top of a-7 is sample collection bag - oh, stand by. oh, shoot, we didn't scratch this out. dad gum it. ll 0b 15 25 lmp what's that?"
that's correct.
"no, we got to start heading back. 05 05 35 54 i2_p-eva but it won't take but a second."
"okay, america. we're ready for the maneuver now."
okay. it's open. please close it.
all right i got you reaching for the flag.

"a hard, hard rock."
"okay, bob. good morning."
"fred, are you sleeping'.' 05 12 28 51t i_t_ go ahead."
"now we've got 17 minutes. we're coming up - or on 17. we separate at 15, at 290:08:31. we'll hold off on the logic until 17. okay?"
okay.
"- - but i suspect they're lying by this big rock, and they may be the same kind of - same kind of rock. charlie, i'm going to get that bag out from underneath your seat and put the samples in there."
mark. 230/2.9. we're on the east rim.
okay.
that's affirm.
"negative. all we wanted to do was just - the guidance systems state vector's okay and con- figured before los, and i don't believe we have an update. i'll check."
"okay. go to the section on ""flight plan updates."" it has the emp programs."
250th.
"roger, nell. you're five-by."
"... though, is it?"
"orion, houston. let's go back to lo bit rate, please, 06 18 48 00 _p-_ houston, orion. we have a crew status report for you."
"roger. reading you - reading you loud and clear, john."
"roger. we're doing good. we're 092, now; heading slightly south."
"we're working it. okay, we'll go ahead and give you 10 minutes."
okay.
i was afraid you would.
okay.
isn't that what you thought it was? isn't that what you thought it was? huh? i thought you were kidding.
"yes, he's moving. just like he did in the simulator the other day."
okay; bk's the next one.
"columbia is holding inertially at lift-off atti- (columbia) tude, my dap is configured as per my procedures at a time of 124 02."
"is that okay, you guys?"
roger. got the deletion at 212:40. go.
i think you gave me a call at 79_ didn't you?
"well, the lm looks nice on the outside. iconfidential 5"
"okay, buzz. last entry is down under rcs, _nadit's a typo error under the three - in the line ""three- axis attitude control."" if you proceed to the right at pdi plus 05, you'll see one axis. the line goes all the way to low gate to touchdown. that's incorrect. the line should stop under ""5 min- utes to low gate."" over."
"i know it. man, we come a long way. i thought this thing was just right next door to us."
okay. here's the countdown.
sure. *** step?
now you're going to go over and start the det.
got that ...
some of the big ones that are just barely expose_ above the regolith looked quite well-rounded. most of those around the craters are subangular. i think - i got the impression that it's just purely a function of how long the same material's been exposed; but some of the big boulders like the one out near the geophones is quite angular in part and quite rounded on other parts. it's quite variable.
"yes, i think - -"
"okay. it's reasonablly good. we can make out fred fairly well. looks like he's in a shadow. hey, that helps. you just turned up the lights, huh?"
okay_ houston. how do you read on the alfa?
_s mode's on.
"okay, 30 seconds; 308 is your number."
that's affirmative.
"go ahead, houston."
"okay, karl. i'm over the hadley area now. i've gone by it. and nothing more to report on the hadley, except one observation that i meant to make the last pass and didn't. i'll make it now. and that is that the landmark 15 40 is readily visible, even with the naked eye. you don't need a sextant to see it."
we're happy for the time being. we're - we're standing by for a crew status report at your convenience. and we'll be watching for the gainstep shield to come off.
waste water ... 20.
okay; thank you.
"hello, dave. no argument; what are you doing way out there?"
i think you got ... pretty bad. 04 05 23 01' cdr is that what ...?
"well, if you want to get - well, what i really want to do is make sure we got helmets and gloves ... be right back. 08 23 42 00 iaqp where you going?"
roger. understand.
"yeah, i get a chuckle out of that."
"okay. it doesn't cut out anything. in fact, we picked a time that's pretty much dead time as far as the flight plan goes. take a look, and we'll talk about it later."
okay. he is on his way. go ahead.
"okay. oh, jack, i could swing it over the - #*# any problem. #** strut. okay; and the jet bag is ### free - swinging free."
*** real easy. here's a whole big - we ought to take that just as is.
"okay. where's this now, hank?"

"okay, ed. we can see you coming down the ladder, now."
"no, your hoses are in my way. i'm coming around the other d - way."
"okay. from our pictures, and this may not really be the case, on the - above main display panel 3, where it says - where the handhold, the structure part of handhold, looks like there's some cracks and crevices right above - right around that hand- hold area that could, between the handhold and panel 6, that a pair of scissors could slip up into."
"at 196:35, add ""enable all jets, except a-i, a-2_ b-i, bravo 2, delta 1, delta 2."" 08 03 30 19 c_p hank, is that the sly_ jets - _ett _onfi_-urati_n? 08 6,3 30 21 cc iiega%iye. this gives you couple je%s in all axes but roll, and we want quad 3 providin6 rail control. now this is so fd0 can get good trac_'lng for tel, and this is being coordinated with 0s( and is acceptable to %he mapping cazaera pads."
okay.
"hey, houston, i have 90 - yeah. ain't that amazing."
"okay, verb 57 is in. houston, is the ags out of plane correct?"
there's - it's - looks like a place you could spin [?] a profile on.
what of this do you want?
it's probably because we turned the water off.
okay. 07 00 00 35 lmp-_ elt [?]

"i got to take a couple of more pictures at that contact slope over there. i know - you can't see it from where you are, jack, but i guess we got to leave. otherwise it would he nice to sample that dark stuff up on top."
"- - on the seat. i just haven't learned - i'm getting more finesse now. i think you can over- work yourself, instead of making use of the 1/6g."

okay. looks like a secondary impact crater that occurred - recently.
... good way ...
"okay, start a - a pan around it, gene - -"
okay. 03 23 h4 27 lmp the l-shaped bag is ...
*** sort of a med - moderate hard tap. *** level.
"i didn't get the latitude, but the longitude is minus 165.67; range te go, ]]629; ve]ocity 36291; 142:41'30."
normal.
"roger. and, dave, the diverter valve is yours."
"yes, i hope so."
"okay, copy. you didn't purge fuel cells."
"okay, and when you get done there, ed, i guess you can proceed with getting some documented samples b_fore we have to depart."
yes.
yes.
save you some food? i'm not sure there'll be any left. i have a well-stocked pantry here.
"okay. the nay is lg6 at 0.5. we ought to see the old beauty when we top the rise here. john just ran over a basketball-size rock with the right wheel and just - there she is, john."
"yes, he is off the biomed for a while."
"the mesa blanket, john, that you usually fold up and put away there, we'd like you to put it over the tv until you use the tv."
"audio control, normal."
roger. they're looking here - looking good. lnp sure felt like it. i think we saw them all from here.
"cabin is holding at 3.5. and suit circuit is locked up at 4.5, and pga is decaying greater than 4.5 - _.6. okay."
"and, no, i didn't go through zero."
there's the after.
roger. 0mni delta.
that's too - that's too - -
yes.
s-ii cut-off.
"houston, 13."
"oh, thank you, geno. it looks much better."
...
"okay. i've already got the heater, on. and give me about 5 minutes, and i'll get the pad."
"a reminder to hit the stop button, john."
"okay. look at that piece of ice, john."
delta-tig was zero and the burn time was 17 seconds.
"america, houston. for your information, your altitude is about 3000 miles now."
okay. we copy. 04 02 29 42 iamp but it's rcs problem. the coremproblem.
roger. standing by.
"roger. we confirm that. lm2 by the way, those were the - i guess you know - the sensors that we put on at the cape. and they still seemed to he in good shape when i took them off. i figured i'd let things rest a while, and then i'll put them on again tomorrow. 0i 23 02 55 cc roger. looks like you've got eat period scheduled here for an hour, and then into the presleep checklist."
"and, tony, mark has his first one all the way in to the red mark on the cayley plain."
that - that's verified.
"roger, ron. did you - we didn't copy your answer to our question about any bubbles in the lineal."
this is the worst jam i was ever in.
okay. l_eady to copy.
okay? (laughter)
"casper, this is houston. if there's _u)_h - thing significant from orion, will you relay, because there's excessive noise down here."
"okay. stu, after flashing 61 and before proceeding on that, we'll do a verb 21 noun 46, 30000 enter."
can you see the cabin pressure?
"well, we still have a little way to go."
"dick wants to know where falcon crater is, if you can see it?"
okay. let's try x first.
in that suit loop.
"okay, i copy that too, jack."
"hey, houston. this crater looks like - -"
mapping camera and pan camera are off.
"it is. oh, no; it's not."
"boy, you sure move that rover around when you do that."
yes.
hope we didn't keep you up last night.
so would we.
"okay, hank. i thought 16-3 was to be used only for high altitude. that's kind of a large crater, isn't it?"
okay. and right now the yaw indicator is reading about 280.
"roger, 11. we don't have that capability. we do require that the m-line be parallel to the horizon in order to get a good mark. we feel that possibly the - the state vector information that you were using for your maneuver basis yes- terday may have needed to be updated a little. and if you'll standby a second, we'll give you an evaluation of what we feel you'll get today by the auto maneuver."
"there it was, whatever it was."
"no, no. just - sl - i'm sorry, this to - this to sle_. that what's i was - -"
"the central feature there - the ""y"" in king crater - can you see any expression of that out to the north - through the north wall of the crater, up toward the north?"
i didn't mean to - the rock fell out.
"how do you read now, tony?"
"you ought to have seen old a. j. foyt and barney oldfield all rolled into one on that rover, ken. i mean he really put it through its paces."
"switch, master arm is on. two lights, houston."
yes.
yeah.
... you guy ... over there?
"and the only thing that looked a little different is when i got down to the step where it said ""pan ca_ra mode to standby,"" it already was. i guess that's just an oversight."
"everything on this sep is coming off harder than it did in the - when we deployed it at the cape. see that? it just ... it may not be harder, but it ..."
"man. 06 00 21 00 imp-eva okay, got it. and let me get a locator from up here, too. that's going to be in focus. i'll just - okay, i'm gonna change this, just to - okay, tony. underneath this regolith up here, we've still got the same deal. top centimeter or so is - -'"
"that is a soft life up there, when you get a chance to finish your lunch."
"that's in work, houston."
okay.
"hey, maybe you better call lou and tell him we might be a little bit late for dinner."
"roger; at 46. looks like you gonna make it. and you might keep an eye on the middle gimbal angle on this thing. we're gonna watch it, too."
"joe, i'm going to put - -"
okay.
"and this is a good view of the central peaks, although from some distance; and, as ron and i were discussing earlier, it's not at all clear that that - in fact, that dike does not come through as a - the so-called dike - as a - as a unit that is clearly defined."
roger. get 189 plus 00: rcs total minus 1 per- cent; alfa minus 11; bravo plus 10; cha_ile minus 1; delta minus 1; h2 tot_._lminus 0.76 pounis; oxygen total plus 17.6 pound_. over.
okay.
"roger. sounds like you had things well organized. you might also consider what kind of a stowage configuration ... and what we can leave behind in aquarius,"
a going auto.
"minus 47. (tranq) (goss net ]) tape 70/i6 04 [2 54 54 cc nell, this is houston. will you give us hack when you start - -"
"i'll check. yes, they're both hooked."
"okay. well, that's going to be hard to get. don't put the dirt all over there!"
ah-ha!
"i don't know whether you're wrong, or we are, but - -"
"yes. okay, better record this down ... - - ,.;-.. !t .l i cs; ,mr!r.'-;;';';2;..-"
"roger, we copy. guidance still looks good to us."
understand. move the mass spec boom deploy from 249:05 to 249:30.
"jack, just thought you might be interested. i called some friends of yours in tucson, and every- body's fine there and wanted to say hello and tell you everybody's fine and getting along real good."
"okay, then we'll put that in the big bag."
okay.
look at that ... go by.
"there's no big rocks in it, that i can see. lots of dust on the floor."
"one minute. ems ... 03 02 27 32 cml° translation power, we don't need. the light is out. delta-v thrust a is coming on -"
"well, we can get it all on there, if you'll just put it down here."
"and, ken. we are up - up-linking the state vector to you now."
which one is that?
"casper, houston. _eading you very weak. coming up on 10 seconds to t-2."
"0 - okay. dump the ops, ken, up to - to get the cabin up to 5.6 and then leave it in bleed flow."
"sure it's there, geno? we can shove it underneath your couch."
"be a good idea, mike. 0i 07 25 18 lmp houston, apollo 11. you got a cloud over the houston area right now?"
- - and 33.
hope so. looks like that's the only one i have.
there you go. 08 20 55 57 cusp okay; now two more.
it ain't worth it.
"you can see some of the rays from the crater proclus have spread out all the way across here. and they completely cover up the ridge system that goes around there, so i can't see any color distinction on the eastern - or on the western edge of crisium."
"- - we'd like for you to bring up the high gain, and you' re there."
"wait a minute; 02:23:57, i think it was."
"roger. 01 06 32 i',6 cc 11, this is houston. goldstone m&0 re_orts that they can read the nu_m-oerson the dsky. they can also read verb, noun, program, and see the co_p activity light flashi;,_g. 0vet. gl 06 32 _9 cdr v_ry good. thank you_ 01 06 32 '1 cc and they also report you appear to have panned the camera over to another location now."
"okay. i guess what i'm thinking is, it takes us a lot of time to go through that. turn it on and turn it off. and, of course, we could always use time, but we'll get it."
"casper, houston. the rate in your flight plan about not starting until 121:05 is still good."
"..., jim?"
what'd you do?
"put those in the - under that seat, please."
"okay. one comment, tony, that - about - we were talking about last night that we didn't pass on, that the feeling we got from all the crystalline rocks was that they had a suga_y texture to them."
"on 8-16, change the time ""171 plus 33"" to ""175 plus 32."" change the time ""171 plus 35"" to ""175 plus 34."" and at the bottom change ""171 plus 40"" - -"
"measurables ... i mean, to go."
it's in the big bag.
"orion, this is houston. read you loud and clear."
okay. i copy ...
ah.
open.
"apollo 15, houston. standing by."
"they are putting us in a different orbit, though."
"okay. it'll just verify that i've got everything else hooked up properly. i'd like to keep as close to the normal procedures as i can. hey, you did copy the p52 things?"
"john, could you give us a cuff gage reading?"
...
(singing) music to dump by - how's your oxygen purge going?
reg b.
"yes, karl, this is jim. i'm back in and on comm. as far as that ac and main bus undervolt, i have not much more to add than what i said before. do you have any other questions?"
"okay. out beside ""cb (11) and (16) eps,"" scratch the first line there. that's ""descent eca con- trol, two, close."""
"okay. what do you want to do now, get the hasselblad? 03 /2 18 01 lmp jim, you're all right."
"got the core tube cap assembly, extension handle, two sets of - two sets of tongs. we have a numf.oered geophone anchor on the front. we have the tether, the gnomon, the hammer, the scoop. three core t_es, 35 bag dispensers, closeup camera, two sescs, two 70-millimeter cameras with solar ex- terior, one 16-miilimeter camera and one _g, four weigh bags, two maps, extra number geophone flag, large scoop is on, right. large scoop is on, and we're taking the trenching tool with us."
"okay, that's s as in sugar. okay, on 5-9, left-hand column on - near the bottom of the page, it says ""stow icg in icg bag."" we'd like to change that to ""stow icg skip out (empty pockets) in jett bag."""
okay.
okay.
"what'd i do with them? 05 08 53 20 lmp-i_ what did you do with them? 05 08 53 21 _cdr-lm they're right there over the - oh, they're gone. i put them up over the - right up in here. they ain't there? must be on the floor, then. is all that ripped open or something, charlie? tape 8_/18"
"okay, houston; you've got p00 and data."
roger. pag3e18 jonfide 6 05 13 03 38 _ and we're driving it all the way in pretty easy.
that's correct. and that corresponds to the same inertial attitude that you'd have on the back of your entry card where it shows the hori- zon attitude several minutes prior to ei; it's the same thing.
"at 151:20, ""verb 49 maneuver to bistatic attitude."" and that attitude is ""221, 138, 000."""
"roger. we're standing by, gene."
"(laughter) aw, joe, you didn't even have to tell me, because i knew darn well that was coming with the stuff that we must be on top of here. okay."
"did you re-sort things there, jack?"
okay. we've got our first mark. we should be up with you.
"okay, houston. go ahead."
yes.
exactly what i was trying not to do. (laughter) (m sic). apollo 17 air-t0-ground voice transcription
ems mode to normal.
stand by on that.
roger.
"okay, the next row down, the fourth row, suit fan 1 breaker should be open."
"oh, that thing."
"well, it's in tv already. who put it in tv?"
"... a1 ... in there, i'll get them."
okay; i'm squared away there.
"okay, here it is right now ...."
"john, could you move this foot?"
gear box selector is latched.
roger. we had it. farouk had a pointer on it the whole time. i knew just what you were talking at.
go ahead.
okay.
"okay, we're right with you."
sounds like the headset - -
"no, no. i'm going over here. this is closer. that's a shorter cut."
yes. i'm in real good shape.
"yes, or i'm going to break the tool."
"... both circuit breaker panels were as advertised, gordy."
"in fact, he was just flying around it. 09 08 06 58 sc ... 09 08 07 oh cdr ah, my salvationl i found you, you son of a gun. it's an extra thing."

yeah. 00 02 bb 28 lmp okay.
mark. in the outboard of the left eye - young. a dot flashed that terminated toward the center.
we're halfway between the rim and where the blocky wall starts.
stand by and ... come on.... logic ...
there they are.
"tell me what you are going to do first, though."
- - gravimeter? you've got another big rock over here from the - -
"jack, you ought to get a scoop of that dirt, though."
"okay, good."
"can't terminate it, huh? go to auto in track. 04 04 17 07 c_ okay, jim. to m_e sure there's no confusion, i haven't done anything yet. oh 04 17 10 lmp no, you got to -"
"okay, dick. do your usual good job."
"okay, fine. 05 23 12 00 i24p-eva joe, i'm going to start the camera here. will you keep track of it? i'm on 12 frames per second."
"somewhere i ceased to be careful with my helmet, i can see that because ... (h_,mming)"
they're both in.
"listen. when i get this rock box, we've got to get some more rocks. turned us all around, and we didn't get any rocks."
verify mtvc.
uh-huh.
okay. we're all on the same frequency. we'll do that.
"okay. we need voice, range."
plus 4 point - -
"okay, houston. you're going to 3."
auto cdr.
copy that.
"okay, tony, which - you want me to start with the 0.5?"
what - what's it normally on?
"okay, let's pick up- -"
"yeah, you got it."
"leave it open and i'll dust it, jack."
you got any newsy items for today?
...
"okay; we're coming up on 40 - ia fact, it looks like we're in 44 right now. okay. and, jack, how about let's confirm that the rev 49 was 184:06:20. i2_p-lm oh, i did have that wrong, in the seconds - two zero seconds."
wait a minute.
bet they did.
"okay. that's sort of holding its own, then, isn't it?"
"okay. and i'll be talking to jack here, gene, for a while. you can interrupt with your com- ments over - talking over me, and i'll try and copy them. 06 23 15 22 cdb-eva one comment. i got a flag on the other battery, 139 degrees."
"that's right, jim."
"okay, we copy that. o1 04 32 17 lm_ and, tony, the stuff that - is really not white; it's more of - now it's more of a gold-looking color or sandy color now."
"i'm saying all of them look clean again. i guess they've fired so clean that they don't seem to ... at all .... different color, ... copper, bronze, color of the oxygen cell. they've been fired be- cause i watched them f_re. okay. the earth's going by at an lpd of 42."
... my range and range rate now?
it's safer that way.
okay. standing by.
"houston, the checklist says put function from range to range. it's in all three steps. how do you want it? zl 09 22 39 cc i'm not reading you very well. something you just did has caused a lot of noise down here."
"direct 02, open. 12 07 08 02 p - - the bearing is 130 to - three main chutes. i have visual contact; three main chutes."
okay. let me - lmf-lm you going to be able to get to it?
"houston, columbia. you have p00 in accept, and how are you reading me now?"
"okay. it's in. okay, 42 - 41 lpd, 3000 feet on profile."
okay. 270:49:53.
"boy, are you dirty. i'm just as dirty. don't much want to stay down. okay. that first shape; i can't believe it."
that's his second favorite pastime. he's rigging his hammock for sleep on the lunar surface now to find out - to see what it's going to be like.
"no, no, no need to."
- - drag out your flight plan.
"yes. 05 14 08 35 limp in fact, that green seems to have had less change than most of the rest. okay, pete. that's com- plete."
"okay. the guys are outside now on the surface. they got the rover deployed and they're checking it out. and they're going to try to do the nominal number 1 eva plan. as - about as far as we can predict in the future right now is through - doing the second eva tommorrow. we don't know how consumables are going to hold out for the - for the thing. we're going to have to take a look at it - whether there's a possibility of the third one or not. right now, i'm not so sure."
"okay, i get readings on bus b."

"aad it should be earlier. sunset should be earlier and sunrise should be earlier. well, what does that wark out for sunrise? 00 02 08 05 cb_° 02:19."
that one wasn't on.
"okay, vance. we've got quad c and b disabled."
"yeah, but, you know, rcs is midcourse fuel."
"houston, this is 15."
it'll tell you right there.
i'll take those. i guess it doesn't really matter ...
"okay, the second point is 530 for the dvm and 22h5 for the abort delta-v."
"volt 39.4, amp 1.23."
rrt. y cmp okay. you want to go to rate command?
"yes, i can hold on better that way."
is he pretty good at that?
"roger, ed - ed - understand. p24 landmark track- ing pad: ti at 100:46:29; t2 47:07; tca, 47:37; t3, 47:59. it's a roll of 008; pitch, 296 yaw, 000. expected north at 3 nautical miles. and understand the longitude over 2 is plus 02.149, and latitude and altitude are as in the flight plan."
about there.
"there they - no, we're on forward s-band - no, they didn't come, i thought were. 05 23 18 36 cml° okay, this plane change is minus 0.4."
i don't know what this is. let me get the - ... feet at f:8.
it's bag 26-n.
right. that was a real good boulder.
"no, i've got an 02 press and a vent."
okay. diverter valve is vertical.
"mine's in my helmet bag, so i didn't have to worry about it."
"yes, that's it."
"houston, 15."
"okay, jack; this is houston. over."
"go ahead, charlie."
"aquarius, houston. copy that. it's noisy on our end, too; stand by while we think about it."
okay.
okay.
"go ahead, houston. 0b 01 16 59 cc roger. we're on low bit rate at the present time so it's going to take us a little bit longer than normal to get this stuff up to you. over. 03 01 l? 12 cdr i guess we're in no rush. 0b 01 l? 15 cc okay. we're here if you're there."
"what we want is you to go to ra_ract for l0 seconds, and then: extend. c_ 0_ay. wait 1. 10 18 49 33 cml° okay. retract. there's 10 seconds. back to extend."
"(laughter) okay. 07 21 22 oi lmp okay, houston, this is challenger. i think we're getting close to being able to take your up-link."
"okay. i'll get your film report whenever you're ready, and when you're - -"
"you got to - got to - actually, all we need to do is get 500, do ..., get all that stuff in the bag, and we'll have everything there. if we don't, we're not going to get the film done. and we got to ..."
"houston, aquarius."
yes.
you're losing a little bit out of the third sec- tion here. get the cap on.
okay.
"yes, i sure would. boy, it's coming up slow, isn't .. it?"
that's good.
"and, endeavour; houston. when you have a moment, high gain in auto now."
"now, cabin repress - auto. can't get it. i'll have to turn left, here."
"roger, jack. i noted that."
well - -
- - keeping above the hub here.
"okay, houston. i'm pretty sure the vhf is all right - -"
that one's auto and locked?
well - -
"no, i'm just looking ahead, and i've got 5-1/2 min- utes to go to sleep."
roger. we understand.
"i wouldn't come in much closer than that, _1."
"at the best; yes, sir. now we can put in a higher rate; that's up to you folks. is it worth the gas?"
that contingency sample is black.
"well, this is going to be a backroom brawl."
"okay, that looks good. where's your seatbelt?"
"that was main a, closed, dave."
"okay, go ahead, 16."
"i don't want to go in that crater, that's what i don't want to do. okay. we're at 0.6; how about 339 ·· ·"
"yeah. we don't see any glass, though, particularly."
okay. the ctoseout. circuit breakers all open except auxiliary. bus a and c should be closed.
roger.
delta and baker on the bottom.
thanks. 08 08 42 i1 cmp high gain to auto.
"that's going to be pointing right at the lunar module, houston."
look at that el; it's pink.
"does that look like the moon to you, houston?"
"okay, that ... 00 00 4b 00 cmp yeah, (laughter) that would be the part (laughter)."
"and, 15; houston. you are go for los."
"that'_the end of it. w wmw, l"
and you slew to 15.
right there.
"question 16 for each of you: based on your experi- ence, do you have any recommendations right now for the crew of apollo 177"
192:36 - - o8 oo 25 o6 cmp 4o.
"jack, just to ease those words i said before, we looked at the schematics here a second, and you'd be dumping urine out of that same line as that waste vent, and that would probably cause the pressure to build up enough to slow the 02 flow. and we noticed that the 02 flow is climbing back up to where it belongs. lm2_ well, that's clever. okay."
"roger. while we're getting organized to eat a little bit here, i'll give you your morning weather report, if you want it."
"okay . mapping camera. laser altimeter. barber pola, and then a gray. 04 14 52 18 cml° ir; barber pole, and a gray."
"no, it's all that crap we brought in here."
roger. and you can go high bit rate now. eagle can.
"roger, 11. thank you very much. that was one of the greatest shows we've ever seen. we sure appreciate it. over."
yes.
houston.
"roger. let's go on with the circuit breaker panel checkout. 02 12 34 34 [mp okay. i'll just give you - i think it'll be easier to give you what i got in. okay, in the top row on 11, we have the four ac bus tie breakers in and the ac bus volts breaker in, and that's it. second row, we have the four tca breakers in. we have the gasta under flight displays and commander's fdai. and likewise under ac bus a, we have a gasta and a commander fdai breaker in. that's it. on row 3, we have a signal conditioner 1. we have the atca (pgns). we have the engine control breaker, attitude direct control breaker, and the - under lighting, anun/dock/component breaker in. and one other, ed logic power a - ed logic power a is also in."
okay.
if you don't recognize a thing_ i'll look - just tell me - i'll look out my side- -
"roger. at 218:02, we change the camera configura- tion there. we're going to use window 5, cm-5. we need the 80-millimeter lens - 80-millimeter lens, and the setting should be stop 2.8; ex- posure time, 1 over 250."
"okay, give us a hack and we're copying your noun 20s right now."
"okay, down in the middle of the page on line 9, we're just going to strike out the ""activate vhf for comm checks,"" and line 10, ""verify the dse."" we're going to leave the dse off, and that's to save power, as is the vhf activation."
just shot 169 of the old rover sitting there. boys that's a good machine.
"okay. separate, simultaneous communications link in use between cc and cm"
"okay, we're all settled down now with some good beefsteak, and all cleaned up and ready to talk. 05 08 h9 36 cc sounds very good, dave. we've got a list of questions here; some fairly general geology ques- tions at the last, and, depending upon your an- swers, we'll build a good part of eva-2 on it. stand by a second; i've lost a lockon. okay, we'd like to begin, though, with some fairly simple mechanical questions that'll require a ja, nein answer to most of them, i think. and they involve alsep and - rover. and i'll just - start off at the top of the list here. dave, which alsep photos did you get out of the way?"

roger. copy. (nc)comm for 25 minutes)
"that's a brand new roll, too, isn't it? man, you got two rolls here haven't even been expose d yet. these two right here."
there she goes. it was a good one.

omni charlie.
we're copying 5 by. how us?
that's a ...
okay.
here's your scb.
okay.
"okay, i got it."
looks good on my side. how is your side?
"okay. step 6, ""transfer to lm power (floodlights blank), caution warning power caution light on. report get to mcc. panel 11, circuit breaker eps traeslunar bus tie, closed. circuit breaker panel 16, eps traeslunar bus tie, closed. cir- cuit breaker panel 11, lighting utility, closed. and activate utility lights."" over. and, 13, houston. select omni bravo, please. 02 02 37 08 lamp okay, joe. i'ye created a new page here called tlc-la, item 6, transfer to lm power and the usual check that the floodlight's blank and that i 'ye got the caution warning power light on; i get a get from jack, and i will pass that on down to you. item 7, circuit breaker eps translunar bus tie, panels ll and 16, closed. step 8, circuit breaker lighting and utility on panel 1, closed, and turn on the utility lights. however, the lighting is such that i don't really need those. they are in stowage, right now, i guess, in the isa, and i'll probably just leave them there."
"yes, it _ou].d be nic-_r if it had _:other order of magnitude of power on it. of course, it has a tendency to jiggle around a little bit, and you might want to have some sort of a bracket. i hate to use that word though."
roger. i read you the same.
"okay, jim, the helium is holding right up there. it's 2400 and that was where it was before we started getting those rcs lights. the pressure never has gone above about the 205, 210 maybe."
easy. how's that? /--_ tape 143/23
okay.
anybody want a grape - - 03 13 19 15 cml° did anybody tape those up yet?
*** cover on this one.
"oh, well - yes, the - at least as my - far as my solo book goes, the aos/los was in a minute of - shown in the - on my solo book."
"apollo 11, houston. our recommendation for the isa is to stow it back over the instrument panel. over."
limit cycle's on.
"okay, we're coming up."
yes.
"that could be rhysling, dave; we'll find out when we get up on top of this ridge."
"let's not read that in the r1, r2. i don't want verb 69 twice. i want verb 49, 58g's so i can fly the needle."
"okay, that's verified. closed and locked."
yes. yes. i didn't use that this morning.
okay.
rogers jack_ that's very interesting. can you zoom in on that whole valley?
i'm going to go back into auto here.
"no, wait a minute, al; have you got it strapped around your boot? let me look and see."
roger; houston.
"apollo ll, houston. we see you in p41 now. it might take you a couple of minutes to integrate these vectors that we gave you and if you don't make tig, it's pretty insensitive. you can just let p41 bring you up to tig, and when you get to zero, you can burn on that. over."
good.
ail you had to do was close them anyhow and leave that crossfeed open.
"that's great, it says decongestant - -"
can you pull it - let me get your umbilical.
"press reg b to direct 02. p e28 , ··"
"that's the main regs coming in, i'll bet you."
"apollo 15, apollo 15, initial rates look good. we'll be keeping an eye on it though for you, al."
"well, why don't you lean against the rock? go over there and lean against it."
"yeah. 06 01 59 44 i_p-eva there's a pretty big crater, with some blocks around it. i think that might do."
so's charlie.
"pete and al, houston. we show you are 3 plus 35 into the eva. and you've got plenty of consumables, so we suggest you go at a relaxed hustle to get back in. 04 22 42 54 imp okay. it's almost all done. think we've got it made."
"go ahead, joe."
roger.
yeah.
yes sir. okay. good bye.
"that's affirmative. and the new high gain angles will be pitch, minus 27; yaw, 339."
"and, america; houston. we'd like wide on the high gain."
"i might add to jim's comment, that the near - the near side of the rille wall is smooth without any outcrops, there by st. george, and the far side has got all sorts of debris. it almost looks like we could drive down in on this side, doesn't it?"
okay.
"orion, the dps pressurization checkout looks good."
the map update?
i think it is.
what test?
the surge tank is reading 860.
"i'm just glad ... 02 i0 51 25 cdr okay, stand by."
yes. blue to blue.
"the event timer's still set at 51, and i'm beginning to get monitoring for time base 6. cmp to the couch. i'm waiting for all this good stuff to start."
...
we'll look at it now.
"yes, jack. i'm on the line ...."
okay. that would be the lm - the lm preentry procedure. yes. okay.
uh-oh. i got it. there you go.
"ve:_y good, ed."
okay. i've got quads a and b disabled here.
"okay. well, why don't we call that a trench? wouldn't that be nice if you could do that at station 8? 06 00 27 43 imp-eva oh, i hope so."
"i'm reading 100 percent, houston."
yes.
"fifty-meter crater that's a secondary or at least - it might be a primary, with these blocks just bein_ out of it. and it's quite deep."
"okay, purge valve is locked, and it's high."
"okay, the radar's on. the pgns are on. 07 03 48 54 cml_ vhf range has us at 117 now. 117."
"go ahead, houston; kitty hawk."
okay.
"okay. command module rsc propellant, two, off. 10 04 34 35 r tallyho; another visual: 4 miles. getting n130 - -"
okay. you want to copy dowr:tha solution?
"okay. plss prim water closed. port hatch closed and locked. i've got to get the upper valve, jack. move in. lmf okay. how's that?"
"reading you 5-square, fred. how me? 04 09 _6 48 lmp okay. i'll stay this mode, if it's all right, so we won't be hot miksd."
okay.
"okay. down - toward the bottom of the page, about three lines up, we've got a comment in there. ""if greater than 1.5, battery vent valve, vent."" we want to change that 1.5 to 3.4."
huh?
"apollo 11, this is houston. over. (goss net l) tape 50/6"
"eagle, houston. you are stay for t2. _ver."
off.
"i don't like this strap in the way up here, al."
stand by. !
okay. i'll just have to be careful. okay. i've got it.
roger.
"okay. and, i guess in that case, we'll probably break the suits down and then run another suit check before we see you around the corner. so -"
"okay, why don't you go ahead on 3-817"
"they - they don't think at this point that it's anything that you did, and it appears to be a transient problem, but we won't know until we take a look at it."
okay.
"it's there. minus 33, plus 54. lt_ okay. we're ready. _lere do you want that, on supercrit?"
they get upset when there's just medication gone.
"go ahead, houston."
"joe, i understand you have another change to the activation checklist."
"well - not - that's - okay, but that's different· that 's unavoidable, you know, and we regrouped from that nicely. we got everything done that we would have done - at least on my end, i got every- thing done that i would have done had we not slipped that three revs. so that was no - you know, that - that part worked out okay."
i'm on the lunar surface.
"so, as soon as - then as soon gordo said, ""one g,"" you calibrate yourself, and you're okay from there on."
"yes, i know there's lots of time, i'd just as soon take my time while i'm getting it up there."
"there are a lot of large fragments here, joe."
can you turn around?
"okay, it's locked."
"that's affirmative; and after that, you pro on that, and you come up with a flashing 0688, and we'll have to load noun 88. and if you're ready to copy, i have the sun half-unit vectors at 74 hours get. over."
...
"yes, sir. looks llke everything worked out great. you're at 2.7 and climbing very slowly."
"yes, it looks real good. i got some pictures of the bottom of it, too, i think. %ten you _ays were going around there. and that looks real nice."
"okay, do you want to - do you want to trim?"
"jack, i can definitely tell we're moving away from the moon, now. i got it all in the monocular at one time. we're right over the top of fpa 8 right now."
okay. we've got a picture.
all right. copy that. there's no point in putting it back in. it probably wouldn't go in anyway.
"say, jack, we got a request in here from our aria friends."
"yes, _u .... seems like it can be just a hell of a ..."
don't find a fresher one?
confound that curve.
"roger, al."
then tie this thing.
that's what you got a flight plan volume for.
yes. o0 02 41 149 aa ...
"don, how about if i put off this scan ratio thing another 10 minutes?"
"okay. stand by on that one. this is a question of geometry, and i'll get right back. apollo 13 air-to-ground voice transcription"
yeah.
"no, no, no. no that - well - no, i got to fold out one page length. no."
"yes, but we can - i can still drive a core with the h_mer if we need to."
roger; we copy.
i've got it on. cool it.
"yeah, it looks good."

roger.
"install gas connector plugs. and then commander first, disconnect ops antenna lead. : ggwlllmqa l 8 2-225"
yes?
"i will throw one thing right quick, you know the activation descent day, that was the third one i had handled, and including all the simulations and all the three of the actual flights, i think it's the first time we can say that we really did it all right. for one reason or another, it really turned out to be a fairly easy day and i was really surprised."

"yea_. okay, tony. that's frame count 156 and 157 - -"
yes.
you want a wet pack? you sure?
"okay. how you doing, babe? separates simultaneous communications link in use between cc and cm"
freaking checklist isn't nothing.
it's close.
"roger, joe. figured, if we're going to do this burn in pgns now, i ought to give you an update on the contingency book pages 32, 33, and 34, be- cause the last time we went through this portion, we were burning it in acs. ta_;e91/8 l':j.l_a' 7 ]4 (?, 17 ob 2'1' c(] ()k;ky , l,'r','d. ;;c:tltd by, w,t'v,' b¢_,'n l._l.kinli about i_o::::;bly itav'ir_/"" .you do il in /5;i;i. we p,..,::ommend at ia,i:: t,irrle lhrd, ,you (;¢) ylrjalii; [,(1 ['cjn_;:ti in""_, the lie)() piti:; 3 proc¢-_dm tm only. over."
"okay, bob, i guess one thing we don't have a handle on yet is what are the - i think we sampled them - once in a rover sample, but what are the fragments out here mixed with the light mantle?"
"the position of the lmp's canister - the lmp's canister is sitting on the eps panel now, and the cdr's canister is positioned up in the tun- nel."
"okay. now, i'm going to put these stuff under - there you go."
... an iteresting.
roger. i i
"okay. i was looking over this transfer list - about 184:00, and i don't remember gene and jack leaving their helmet stowage bags back to me. so i think they must have them in the lm - in challenger."
"roger, ron, and we are going to simul. i under- stand jack is reading us on the vhf."
that's affirmative. that's obsolete now that you've done midcourse 2.
"no - no - okay, bob. mapping camera is going op_. 08 13 _5 lb cdr mark. and it's gray. and you want to extend the mapping camera, huh? '"
"yes, i turned the dump off."
"roger, ron. c_l° and in case you're won - in case you're wondering, we changed the procedure there a little bit. it was more convenient for them to get those guys suited first and then me."
"your volts and amps time, jim."
okay. okay.
"doesn't it bother you to wield such power, gordy?"
"stand by on that, ron. we concur on that, ron."
"13, houston. at your convenience, we'd like the lm/cm delta-p reading."
"you know what i bet you did last night, joe? you let some of those marshall guys come up here and fix it, didn't you?"
"now, there's three holder things for the 70 milli- meter."
you get a good night's rest?
"well - that didn't get done, jun - joe. we'll - i'll pick it up - remind me after i get the - lr cubed on the rover, joe; i'll do that."
"but i want to - okay. mine's back there_ just a second, i'll get it."
except for the alsep part of it.
"okay. let's get the descent engine sample, jim."
"dubhe. dubhe. yes, she's going to be right in there."
copy that.
"oh, yeah. no doubt about it. see the whole bloody constellation. 04 00 57 04 iimp okay, that was vhe y, right?"

"okay. yes, it's right here in the tunnel."
"go ahead, houston."
"well, i got one."
"no. no. but that just isn't - you know, that just isn't much. i can hardly get a heart rate enough to even tell it's there. it doesn't seem like i can change it with the equipment i have."
roger. they're right on the ball.
okay.
okay.
okay.
"okay, charlie. we've got the block data for the lm lift-off, lm timeline book. 04 19 55 22 l_)-lm you speak."
"yes, sir."
i'll bet you 100 dollars.
give up?
that's true.
... on that.
i didn't think they could see me. i'm way up on top.
go ahead.
"okay, overhead or forward dump valve open, then auto, at 3 and a half."
... the view there.
go straight down from where you are.
ail right.
"oh, okay. i was waiting to see if you guys were ready to listen to it. the first item - which has been a continuing item here during the flight - in kansas city, former president harry s. truman's condition continues to deteriorate as doctors are unable to restore his vital kidney functions. on the paris peace talks scene, there has been essentially no apparent further developments today. it continues about the same. and in new york, police are red-faced, it says, when it was learned that more than 50 pounds of heroin origi- nally seized way back in 1962 - this is part of the french connection business - has been stolen from the police building where it was being kept as evidence. and a last local news item. three prominent houston men are missing. they were last seen in person at cape kennedy in florida on december 6 but were apparently lost among the 500,000 people who watched the launch of apollo 17. the following appeal, it says, is issued in case they are listening: ""gene, jack, and ron, - come home. and if you pass a fellow with a bushy white beard and crimson suit, advise him you'll be home before christmas."" that's the extent of the news. lm_ we saw him the other morning briefly, bob. and all four of us will be around at the right time. 09 oi 22 37 cc that's good news. we'll pass it on. apollo 17 air-t0-gro_oi{d voice transcription 09 0! 25 38 cdr bob, i've gov some onboard readouts if you want them."
"now, i got it. i've had my eye on that boulder. you can't see the track from here. i'll bet you can. i can see it now. we'll see it - we'll be looking right up it - looking right up the old boulder track. man, i tell you, this navigating through here is not - -"
"... fa_e 90 01 06 47 1_ cc hey, there we go. incidentally, we've been getting ali kinds of tits of information to pass up to you. we've had baseball scores coming in, basketball. somebody said there's 220 days, shopping days left until christmas. o1 06 47 46 cml° yes. who won the masters, vance?"
"you're loud and clear, and i got a tone."
yes.... bad.
"the crater on our left - that is, south of us - is a large crater. it's somewhat deeper than craters of the same size that we've seen. and it, too, though, has - it's blocks - mainly - large blocks mainly in the walls, although there are blocks - blocks up here in the rim, *** up to 3 meters. *** blocks over there - that may be it."
"okay, 414 plus 2.... 68, recorder, off.... 4."
"and, falcon, houston. do you know if the circuit breaker was out, or did it pop? can you verify what - either? -"
"roger, jack. 01 15 _1 36 cmp okay. there's the delta-p of 2. we'll close the equalization valve. yes, we'll monitor for 3 minutes now. 01 15 _4 01 cc geno, houston. we just wanted to verify that no - none of the lights in the matrix were - flashed when you operated that switch and got the master alarm."
"13, houston. (_n_o_ead."
"okay. track landmark 130 prime using p22, and for information, this will properly position your rendezvous radar transponder. ti is 122 plus 16 plus 05 - whoops, okay. stand by."
"okay. turn to 17 hours in the flight plan, page 18."
okay.
some people will do anything to set a record.
not until 90:30.
when - when do we do tli?
"dave, the dust may have settled up there; i'm not sure if it's settled down here. we've got more data than we know what to do with at the moment. what can we help you with?"
"okay. engine arm, descent."
"and, pete, your first view at tsiolkovsky out of my window is pretty - it's a spectacular sight the tape49/3 way that - looks like a marshmallow float - a central peak floating in the top of a hot chocolate."
okay. now - -
okay.
"go ahead, aquarius."
where'd you put it?
"yes. , 01 08 48 38 lmp okay. at 60 seconds, give me a mawk and i'll give you a time."
"jack, we need the - we think you missed a step. we need to -"
roger.

my watch is - my - -
"okay. and, jack, the earth lpd angle is 24 degrees."
don't like hustling. i'll be dobbed! let's go. 04 22 17 02 ia_ okay.
"okay. and, gene, did you happen to notice the ... on the stuff when you dusted them?"
"oh, that's ..."
"on mine, i've got to get - s-band is t/r. ics is t/r. relay is off. mode is vox. vox sensitivity is *** i'm in vox. vhf a is t/r. b is receive. a, t/r; b, receive. *** read commander on vox?"
ah ha! hatch open.
"okay; we're going to update the iu nav vector based on tracking at carnarvon. we'll have you leave that in accept all the way through the states pass. when we get a better track here across the states, we'll update it again - before the end. over."
z hope you're going to save all those charts you're gathering together as we talk about it on this outbound leg. be interesting to compare them and the pictures we take sometime in jmluary.
"ckay. here comes - you just wanted to look at the yaw. here comes yaw number 2. there it is, and it's oscillating now, and it's damped out, and that's in auto. i'll switch it to number 2, and number 2 in auto. i'm now going to move the thumbwheels, and it -well, now it's - there it goes -now it's oscillating and divergent, and i'm turning the gimbals off. okay; yaw gimbal number 2 is off. i'll hold this configuration."
"there is another one of our blue-gray breccias i think, over there; recrystallized breccias with some of that crushed anorthosite in it. i think right in here i'm going to take the pan at about - - /_ cc and, jack, what's your frame count?"
"one at a time's better, ken."
complete. (t_q)
"okay, lcg pump, opening."
"i'm talking about - about the present fender that's on there, the aft end of that fender. about how much overlap do you want with this makeshift fender? just give me an idea. i think i could figure out when z get there, but i'd rather have your feelings before i do."
okay. and we're ready for the high gain. 02 11 43 31 cml° okay. apollo 17 air-to-ground voice transcription
... 32 ... 03 ]fl45 11 _ yes.
lo bit rate.
roger.
okay.
wait - -
313.
okay. i'm looking north. this is beautiful! you really get the idea it's a planet. it's just a - 08 08 37 28 cml° look over here.
i'll ... around.
i couldn't tell i made a dent.
*** we'll give it a try.
"(laughter) must be accelerating ... m_ ems pump. cnp well, i'll be darned."
it really is neat to have a gravity field around to set stuff on. that is really the cat's meow. (laughter)
"okay, 16. we want you to go to a roll of 020 with the same pitch and yaw angles that you have now. and you should be able to do the p52 in the new attitude, and the high gain should stay locked up."
"okay. p24 landmark track pad, lm visual. t-1 is 106:33:59; t-2 is 106:38:06; tca is 106:40:29; t-3, 106:40:57; you're off track 3 nautical miles north. and one note on that, use omni charlie. over."
"gordy, this isn't my day. i'll give you the damp- ing again."
okay. there were 30 clicks of right yaw.
"i just did that, john."
four seconds.
and you know what we should have done - -
"position 3, i see the other side of america and very, very clean air, very clean. okay, i got a good view of the side of the service module, and you can see these little blisters in the side of the covering there quite distinctly. i think people were talking about those before."
... what are we gonna do with our suits now? i hate to waste all the effort to wad them up. how about -
- - ... today. okay.
"106, 3.2. we're approaching the rim of victory."
"okay. how do you read now, joe?"
copied.
"fred, this documented sample that i got of the buried rock, it's too big for our regular weigh ba_s. see what i can do with it. the regular sanple bags - i'm sticking one over it, but it'll never close. okay, it's going in it. and will probably stay, but it won't close it. it's bag n_aber - -"
"well_ it's kind of a - wells we'll get down there and get closer inspection. what was the general color of all the structure? for example, all the struts and the like? tell you what, it looks like - -"
question 11 is for jack. do you think the united states waited too long to send a geologist to the moon?
plus - roger. plus 0.06.
some of the men are going to have to assemble that.
we got plenty. we're gonna - we're gonna start ours _ too. 07 08 16 29 i24p want to pro?

you want to give me a complete - -
"okay. i'm just about ready to - pick up - old the biggy, geophone 4."
you remember that - that plastic bag like we ... the last day of the lm - threw the lm? there were two of those left over.
look at this. this has got be something ....
this doesn't push.
ail righty.
"aquarius, something we're thinking about right now is, if we can do it without using a lot of rcs, it would be to our advantage timewise to try to get an alinemer,t."
there was a little piece of black glass - -
i think the thing to do - i think one of the things we might want to do - -
is it sample containment bags?

i can't do it; they put velcro right here.
"na, not exactly. one of them is sort of lying there. oh 09 55 08 lmp-lm tony, are y'all getting the iiibit rate data here now?"
"okay. i ran to the third mark down from full - whatever that is; empty, i guess. i ran - looks like 50 percent of the mag, tony."

"i'll go over to vox for you, so you can hear it, dick. how do you read me?"
"tell them, hell!"
roger. we're go for staging.
there goes the mesa.
i wonder who's responsible for all this? 07 22 16 47 imp dr ....
okay. i can read it to you. it's roll - - cmp 42 - -
"roger. 0a 00 35 42 lmp-lm jim, could we try a pitch maneuver back to the landing sire viewing attitude, so we'll see if this thing tracks?"
"is that you or me? you expecting a flag, houston?"
"... 10 o0 35 25 cml° i - i repeat, the fdai and the noun 20s look like they're in as close agreement as i can read."
"i think we can find a good site. we may be a little closer to doublet than the - than the map shows, because of the grade going up there; but i think there's a level site fairly close to the south rim of doublet, and we'll aim the camera in that general direction and give you 150 zoom. focus at infinity."
okay. i think that baby is about ready.
"vox sens at max. i t/r, and b is received. on 16, your breaker open and connect to plss comm. okay, connect the plss coremand then put your breaker in."
"you know, i feel tired when i'm in here. but out- side - i never was tired a bit, outside. never felt tired."
there you go....
let me read the pdi rules to you.
and you can skip all the ingressing parts and go on after that.
"the back room would like you to kind of concen- trate on looking on that dike, if it is at all possible, ron. even if you have to use - -"
"roger, jack. i'm sorry on that. i've got some - some notes from the flight surgeon - -"
58 what?
"yeah, the real moon is just like photos - the more you look, the more you see. you'll be happy to know, though, that, until you get used to it, the craters on the real moon can turn inside out just like they do on (laughter) on the photographs."
turn it - have it up? l0 03 16 30 imp yeah.
"america, this is houston. how do you copy?"
"at least no one let any air out of the tires. man, i look like i've been on the surface for a week already. holy smoley. okay. pull pins on deploy cable and fittings - move lrv from lm."
"oh, i see. i'll trade with jack, here."
"aquarius, houston. go ahead."

"columbia, houston. i have a p22 update for you. 04 09 19 57 camp columbia. go ahead. (columbia)"
"yeah, it does exactly. and it goes right up over the ridge, a ridge line and back down the ridge - the one with - the one that's got cinco craters on it, and then back down into the ridge where -"
i wonder if i took a picture of that block deal? (laughing) i hope i did. getting to be so automatic that i'm not sure what i'm taking any more.
yes. 06 21 41 55 i2_p-eva - - ...

yes. straight up and down as well.
"what's that? 08 08 39 46 cml° that thing goes off to - to play with itself and then ___u_o_uver at - at 15-minute maneuvers; but you got 8 seconds at the end. if you don't hit pro on it, it stops ri_t there and it won't keep the rate drive going. 08 08 b9 58 cdr no, but you have to watch it; it's okay."
"that's right, track mode switch, off, on panel 12."
said something sooner (laughter). tape 119b/!5
"okay, it should be 192.8 and 111. you've got 192.1 and 114."
"okay, thank you, al. that helps us. and once again, the gainstep on the gamma, up three clicks. and we 're showing that now. 08 02 5833 cmp you've already got it."
give us a call when you get to 10.
"coming up. hey, i got it."
roger.
"well, the main a undervolt - i just happened to be looking right at the panel and the main a undervolt light blinked on for a second. and, of course, obviously, main a is up now."
really ve_j comfortable.
verified. pull this one open.
roger.
yes. i_4p-eva ... tight?
it won't go nowhere.
the old hammering hand -

"roger. 0b 18 38 34 lmp that's tricky; that looks like it's locked, and it isn't. 0b 18 38 37 cdr what's that?"

"let me take a picture of this one, pete. this - -"
"fred, that may be a funny in the data. the rate's gone back to normal; and we'll keep an eye on it, but we don't think you should worry about it too much."
"okay, that - that was, in verb 25 noun 07, that was a 75 enter, 1 e_rer, and then zero enter or a 1 enter?"
"100 hours end 13 minutes, i think we ..."
"go ahead, houston."
"yes_ you're right, you're right, and i'm wrong."

roger.
"loose limits. give me a mark on 5 minutes to go, ed."
okay. i guess i don't need it.
"roger. and your csm weight for your dap is 36,370."
you've got it.
"ll, this is houston. we're not reading you at the present time. you're way down in the noise level. stand by, please."
that big flat thing right there.
"okay. when we get down to the presleep checklist here in about 50 minutes or so, i wonder if you might give us your best guess on the probability of a poi trim tomorrow."
go.
i'm on. do you see -
could you just slide a little bit?
i don't - i hope we don't dump the platform any more.
okay. copy that - -

"yeah, you're right; it is stable ii again."
yes.
"hello, houston."
...
fe's not - he's not too brave. he'll bet you a cup of coffee it's about 6 inches.
okay. why don't you turn that way and let me turn this way?
look at those little tracks down there running in between these two craters.
"okay. kind of like dirty beach sand with a little orange in it, huh?"
all the talkbacks are gray.
st_)ilized - wasn't bad at all.
no.
"okay, ed. i have - i have that one in the flight plan now; at 169:15, r-2 is minus 068.00."

it's doing okay.
"_,_nydo those circuit breakers go in and out on you like that?"
"okay. we'd like you to go to omni bravo, and stow the high gain. and we'll handle the switching."
houston; over - this is 16. over.
"*** i thought last night, bob, that i should use the word aplitic for a texture that we saw in that inclusion yesterday on the south massif."
"*** they wanted 107. *** best i can do. that's not very level for the gravimeter, but - let me see if i can get comm. hey, bob, how do you read?"
"no, now they say we're going back to the lm again. press on with the closeout."
very good.
"yeah, i think so. i'll check again."
"no. okay, we're at 970 feet."
"fred, did you get any master alarms up there about 5 or 10 minutes ago? folks thought they saw some here and they were curious about it."
negative. this is on your checklist.
"or the - no, i don't think it will reach, tony."
"rot control power normal, two, to ac."
why don't you - here we go.
"roger, ron. we copied those. _lp no_ it won't make any difference. okay."
holler when you want to go free.
enough's enough ....
"yeah, it is."
"aquarius, tlouston."
yes. okay. copy that. you guys may be getting just a little far north. you may want to head just a little south to avoid running right into the middle of swp crater.
it's ... close to it....
"okay. that sounds good, jim. fao here would like to request just one more picture before you bed down, if you don't mind."
and the radar lights are out. beautiful.
there's a path through -
"yes, that's right."
"yes, i can do that with the naked eye right now. i'm just coming up on you now, and i can see index from here."
60 at 3.
"i thinkwe did. lmp-ea right at victory, but it didn't show up."
"okay. spacecraft control back to cmc, returns to 0. go clockwise. no mtvc."
okay.
closed.
"okay. let's head back, jim."
"that's affirmative, jim. after the handover apparently they want to make sure that they lockup with you and not the iu."
"very good, and thanks for taking my picture."
"i'd like to just add to that very briefly, gordy, that america has led the way into space in the past. i believe we will in the future. but, a point i tried to get across several days earlier in this flight is that the real promise of the future for all the peoples of the earth is to weld themselves into a coherent group of people who can live and work together and then enjoy all the benefits and all the knowledge that is to come from future space explorations. i think we are doing this not just as americans but as human beings and everyone throughout these countries throughout the world f who are watching us right now are also human beings no different than we are. it's their accomplishment as well as it is ours."
(laughter) hang in there. 153 is the attitude.
"okay. copy that, fred. was the bell deformed on the outside or just nicked or what?"
"i show not quite i on the gage. okay, henry. we're showing _lmost 1 on our gage, and we're letting it - watch for a minute or so."
"tranquility, affirmative. try to lock on again, and you'll lose _m at about 29 minutes and 35 seconds."
"yes, sir."
"houston, 11. i don't believe we were calling you right then,"
"i'll tell you, we'll have to start thinking about ... tape_4/5"
roger. thank you.
yeah.
okay.
"(laughter) it doesn't do too good on the plss connector, though, does it? it's a little bit -"
yes. see - it looks like they progrmmed us for 40-minutes-late lift-off and that's what we have.
"roger, ron. we can accept the noun 05."
"okay, dave. i guess, let me start with the csm consumables. at 235 plus b0, rcs total, hl; quad a: 43, h0, 38, _l; h2 t_-k 1, 41; _0, 36; 02 tank l, 56; 58, _5. flndthe only _mmediate other thing i have for you, dave, is a comment on the maneuver at 236 hours - about the ga.,*_aray boom retract. we'd like for you to confirm - i'll be back when ..."
"195:10:00.00; 137, 020, 016, and -"
... (laughter).
#** this orange juice ...
"yes, now i can. l 8"
"ron, just for your information, we're not going to give you a tei-49 pad or a state vector this pass. we're going to give it to you at the beginning of the next pass. we want to refine our data a little bit."
"okay, houston, while we're moving in here, i can see a few chunks of that platy material, possibly paint, down in the sla sort of bouncing around between the s-ivb and the lm."
okay.
"say that again, ken, about the crater count. _5 02 02 52 cmp it looks like it's higher in the light-rayed material than it is in the darker stuff, which is, i guess, what you would anticipate. )5 04 03 21 cmp if you are a fan of bright-rayed craters, frame number 15 is one of those, just coming up on - oh, lost my place. )5 04 03 55 cml° yeah, it's about halfway between - oh, the begin- ning of the highlands - gutenberg highlands, and - where censorinus is. )5 04 04 13 cc roger."
ail right. let me pro out of there. let's get the damn lights up where we can see.
"a minute, and you're tracking pitch 41."
no. i - i'll look for it ... they're probably right under my feet where all those ... garbage bags. i'll help it ...
okay.
"okay, let's put it right up in there. 04 19 58 59 lhp righ% up there, on that spot? 04 19 _9 o1 cdr yes, you got it. okay, houston. wetre going to move about 10 meters to the west-northwest from those coordinates th._t ed gave you. that will be waere the alsep central station will go. we reserve the right to change our mind as to where we are, when we get up on the hilltop. o_ 19 59 26 cc okay."
"roger. go ahead, jim."
okay. is that something you want to do tonight or do it tomorrow?
what - what was that on repress that you ... normal?
"okay, houston, 15. standby 1."
"just a little bit better, but you're still - -"
roger.
very shortly you should be coming up on the mare prior to the landing site across tranquillitatis and then to the landing site. is that affirm?
"i didn't dig any crater at all. al, you've really got to watch your step down here."
"that's pretty good. pete, i'm going to move just a little bit further to the east - correction, to the north, so that i won't end up over in that hole to the side. okay?"
"the old s-ivb had a flare for the dramatic, but it certainly did its job for us."
"and we got one last item here, which is entitled ""slick trick by an eager beaver"" from flint, michigan. dedication to duty is fine, say flint city officials, but the man who turned several miles of city streets into an ice rink carried that concept too far. he had been told to use the city water truck to wash the streets tuesday morning. he did. dutifully ignoring the 3 degrees below freezing temperature. his trail was clearly marked by irate drivers trying to navigate their dented cars over the glassy surface. officials said salt crews were dispatched, but the sun came out and melted the problem before they did."
"_ot yet, ed, not yet. two more days and you can."
"no. i think - yeah, the rover's hacking it with no sweat over these little ones."
whewl hang on. 05 o! 45 06 lmp-eva and we're coming around left. --_ 05 o] 45 16 lmp-eva heading directly south right now to miss some craters off to our right - very subdued craters.
"yes, that's right."
"ah, let's set - yes, better - your 100 is probably good. delta-v c should be 3.1."
168.
"okay, ron. you're less than a minute to t-i. i'll give you a call at 30 seconds."
i can if you can give me an update.
"well, i got it the best i could. let me get the top of your lcru there."
"okay, john. we'd like to go back to egress on the suit gas diverter, and give us a mark when you do it."
okay. it looks like the dap isn't stable now. how about if i give it a verb 46?
"yeah, that's what it is."
we just can't find any words. everybody's peeking out the window here.
"aquarius, l{ouston, i haw_ some additional entry data that goes with the pad i just read up. it's five items. let me know when you're rea_ r to copy. it's on a maneuver pad."
go ahead. o2 19 59 19 cor ...
okay. there's a lots of goodies right there on the inner rim.
"okay, zero bmags."
mark it. we heard it.
and we'd like emu check before you take off. 06 00 58 23 i24p-eva ... i don't think it's going to -
"hey, houston - correction -aquarius, houston. we're satisfied with our present alinement. we don't want you to waste any more rcs gas trying to do this p52, and be advised you guys are hot mike, if you haven't heard. over."
roger that.
go ahead.
"you've got that. 0b 15 48 52 cmp 3, 4, 5 - -"
"okay, 21118."
"(laughter) okay. panel 9 is receive, and we're in duplex, and squelch b is adjusted."
yawing out.
"(laughter) no, no, we weren't having a competition. we were just showing you some of the things you could do with a 360-pound m--_s that only weighs 60 pounds, even slowed down, if you will, by the pressure suit. and i don't think anybody won; we were just demonstrating what you could do with the suit. 10 03 36 42 _ ..."
and all the systems down here are looking in good shape as you go around the corner.
"roger, dave. are we on photo 25?"
okay.
"... we've got quite a few pictures ... 02 23 4h 06 cc apollo ll, this is houston. i think we have comm again. we heard you calling. over."
"no, they don't have the same velocity. they just sort of sublimating out of there. the other ones were coming out like a rifle shot."
the lm exterior looks real good. the lm exterior looks beautiful the whole way around. real good shape .... that doesn't look like it did the day we launched it.
houston. apollo 11. the earthshine coming through the window is so bright you can read a book by it. %'gossnet 1) tape 46/6
it's okay. it'll hold for a while. okay.
it looks about right. right on time.
copy that. and we're saying the same thing -
yeah. are you ready to do that now?
is it going to fit in there?
asking right now.
"mark cdr. it was in the left eye about 2 o'clock; a quarter of the way in; intensity l; point source. yes, we're taking it all for you, al."
"yes. not as well, but we're reading you."
there you go.
"orion, ho,,t do you read casper :_-_vhf alfa? ot 10 02 04 cdr man, you're just super on vhf alfa. how me?"
okay; rough calculation says we should pick up aos about 102:02 ....
"okay. casper, let's take the logics, off, and we'll go through it again."
okay. okay; you want it on vertical. pick up my 0ps hose.
i was wondering what you did to fix the master alarm problem.
...
"excuse me. 03 23 04 b2 cdr that's all right, charlie. what he said, wasn't it?"
"got the wrong place. open, then auto at 3.5. oktkv; go ahead."
"okay, al. and i - i forgot to tell you when you are dumping water, you can also go ahead with the urine dump if you need to do that. i just forgot to mention that. the map camera photo pads for rev - -"
get it with this here.
"okay, that sounds reasonable because it's just nothing but lots of rolling terrain."
"like omni charlie, please. i 00 02 58 33 _ roger; 0mni charlie."
it's just - just below 13.
"okay. and, jack, before you leave, we'd like you to change mags before you get to - before you leave this station."
"okay, pete. when this thing drifts through there, i'm going to punch an enter."
we're a little reluctant to break out the suits.
let's see. am i getting all tangled up in the hose. i don't think so. am i?
copy that.
"minus 67, minus 72."
i don't think we'd better put this one up for sale. somewhere there might be somebody who would like to buy it.
roger. los 110:55: - -
yes.
_[&ssspec discriminator is going to high.
so cmp and lmp made the swtich.
"fifteen, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 -"

that's in the - -
"roger. and if you'll give us accept, we'll get your state vector up."
i don't know. try it. put your scoop there in the middle and break off a chip. 06 01 44 15 i_ip-eva yes.
okay. i got it.
"roger, goddard. i'm reading you loud and clear, honeysuckle. i'm not getting to him."
"stand by. 04 02 40 b5 cc eagle, houston. we can see all the throttle data - -"
"mine's already slid under. 05 06 52 hl lmp-lm mine wasn't on this side. okay, now, i'll tighten it up for you. 05 06 52 h7 cdr-lm okay. whoa, whoa, cb_wtie. i'll never stow it, now. you got to let it up - -"
"ll, houston. we've got a preliminary tei 30 pad, if you're ready to copy."
"and, endeavour; houston. how do you read?"
"not 7 degrees yet, but it will be at 59."
"say again, there, jack, i - i missed that."
you got it.
"america, houston."
"we can't hear your song, huh?"
"go for pyro arm. 08 02 54 59 cmf say again, hank."
"pete, you didn't roger the film pack. do you have all the film packs and the closeup stereofilm, as well as the tv in that etb?"
"houston, 15. did you get the gyro torquing angles?"
"az.,this is houston. i think it would look a lot - lot better if you could bring it over closer towards the _. 04 18 42 15 _ _t it right here in front of us, al."
the only black and white we have is the one we've been using today.
"and we've dumped the data from the last couple of back-side revs and you sound real good, ron."
"i think we ought to be having aos, gang; we've got - -"
okay. let's see. we'll go find the alsep site; i think we've been there before.
"okay, and the next page, 29, right-hand side near the top, cross out ""photo target 13, north at 5.6, 250,"" et cetera, all of that line. and cross out beneath that the penned-in ""e5 slash 6."""
"gordy, i - i'm thinking the - the top of the - the lm towards the sun is probably the north."
"okay, ed, get that. ()kay. 05 21 37 k3 l_ is ever/thing secured over there?"
"okay. give me vhf ranging, will you, pete?"
forty-five seconds.
"roger. you're looking good down here. of)o;i52 19 ci,r well, we didn't have much time, houston, to talk to you about our views out th_ window when we were preparing for lm ejectioa; but up to that time, we had the entire northern part of the lighted hemisphere visible including north america, north atlantic, and europe and northern africa. we could see that the weather was good all - just about everywhere. there was one cyclonic depression in northern canada, in the athabaska - probably east of _thabaska area. greenland was clear, and it appeared to be we were seeing just the ieeeap in ]reenland. ail north atlantic was pretty good; and europe and northern africa seemed to be elea?. most of the united states was clear. there was a iow - looked like a front stretching from the center of the country up across north of the great l_fm_s and into newfo_andland. 00 04 53 24 cf roger. we copy. 00 04 53 28 c_? i didn't know what ] was looking at, but i sure did like it."
roger.
okay .... 31 to 34.

"oh, there's some vesicular basalt right there, boy. oh, manl hey, how about it, let's - just hold on 1 second, we've got to have - -"
and you - -
"okay. it's sticking - right - turn around. no, that's not it - -"
"yes, sir, bob. you bet you; it sure is beautiful."
you're dreaming.
almost too cold on intermediate. i'm thinking seriously of going to m.
roger. and your exuberance is showing up on the btus. you're running a little high on those.
that's affirmative. but it is already.
"moves out, doesn't it?"
okay.
"(laughter) okay, charlie .... go in there."
"sounds good, pete. just like you wanted."
"that's affirm, al. and the correct time for the t-stop on that was 175:49:36."
"we're doing fine. how are you? you read me, dick? hello, dick. do you read me?"
you get it fueled yet?
"go ahead, endeavour."

"oh, it's zero. _gp-eva oh, you got to get off anyway?"
"hey, wait a minute; we got the wrong ones here. forget it. we'll get back to that. what's in the flight plan will do it?"
"there is a possibility that we'll have some addi- tional overhead at each stop, depending on what the rover battery temperatures are when you get out this morning_ if the rover - if they're high again, then we'll have to probably park at least on some of the stops, if not all - with the up-sun heading and dusting the battery covers and then opening them to let them cool. but, again, that will depend upon _hat we find on the rover bat- teries whe_ we get out this morning."
"i got one. okay, i didn't realize you had one that was empty. excuse me."
roger.
okay. let me - wait a minute. *** get this down around ***. that's around behind you; protected back there. that's below the ***ps hose.
"roger. iffyou're free for a minute, i've got some updates to the p37 pad's that we passed up to you yesterday afternoon, i guess. as a result of doing midcourse correction number 2, the delta-v required in the tli plus 35, 44, and 53 pad's have changed slightly. over. (goss net i) tape 20/2"
"oh, i got to dust those radiators. i can't leave them like that. i tell you, this is not a very good place to dust them, though. let me try one time. oh, boy."

you ought to have me now. does it do you any good?
"okay. try pressure on one of the two upper ones, please."
"roger, jim. 06 18 08 22 lmp-i_m and, are you ready for the battery management called out at 1607"
"collision [?]. okay, we'll just do it right here. tony, i'm 15 m - 15 meters out to the left of the - -"
"ail right. now, you tell me what the vi is."
"no, i didn't copy that you wanted them open. i just got 107. i was abo_t to ask you that."
"here we show you over the sea of fertility now, and we ought to have langrenus down south of track a few degrees, about 9 degrees south of track. (gossnet l) tape51/4 03 06 41 48 ia{p now the crater that's in the center of the screen now is webb. we'd be looking straight down on it at about 6 minutes before power descent. it has a relatively flat bottom to the crater, and you can see maybe two or three craters that are in tilebottom of it on the western wall, the wall that's now nearest the - the camera. near the bottom of the screen, we can see a dimple crater, just on the outside. and then coming back toward the bottom of the screen and to the left, you can see a series of depressions. it's this type of connected craters that give us most interest to discover why they're in the particular pattern that they're in. i'll zoom the camera in now and try and give you a closer look at it."
no. you may have a hard time seeing it.
"okay. verb 41, we've done that. okay."
"a rock. houston, we just found a small sample of the moon floating around in the cabin. cml° hold it there, will you? we can't go on to it now."
"okay. i thought so, but that cable's arranged a little bit differently from the one we trained on."
"hey, you better play the punch line of vhat song again. nobody believes you did it."
... there we go.
"roger; could you give us the - your noun 93s? we'd - had lost data at that point. 04 06 44 10 i_mp-lm yeah, sorry about that, jim. here they are: the star angle difference was 4 balls 1, minus 4 balls 1; our torque angles were minus 0.067, plus 0.108, plus 0.050; torqued at 104:42:25."
"we read you satisfactorily, fred. 02 23 05 53 i_p okay. 02 23 06 17 imp jim and jack are in the upstairs bedroom taking a nap now."

"we'll have it ready for you, ken."
"they're either big ones, or they're little small ones. okay; got the picture."
"oh, now why did you blow your image."
i can break it off.
okay; i see that is no trim.
"okay, ken, you can turn on b3 and the transponder, as you would."
"yes. cochise is certainly a shallow crater, although we knew that. it doesn't have any - it only has one place i can see that has any blocks on the inner wall of cochise. otherwise, it has a surface much like what we're driving on for walls and for the floor. one place on the south - southeast wall is a concentration of blocks much like we saw in henry . or in horatio. but the rest of the crater seems to be pretty well mantled. van serg is a very blocky rim crater, *** blocks up on the rim."
there's a couple of things here that's got to be -
"- - immediately - immediately down-sun of you. we're going predominantly down-sun, now."
"no, charlie. that was our mistake. the first set of angles we called up were wrong."
there you go.
roger.
"yes, but that's a long, long way to go."
"i don't know where my tape is; it's up there some- where, i guess."
roger; thank you.
okay.
roger.
"roger, have you got the new coordinates for me? (columbia)"
roger.
"okay. that's probably a good idea. i've got a pretty low saturation level.- i've - i got a good look at the - both the saxd [?] and at your bright ray on chaplygin on this last pass. and i really don't know what to make of _31 that. that - you're right about the location of that bright ray on chaplygin. so i guess you win on that one. the thing that i thought was rather intriguing about that was that there are all kinds of big blocks all around the outside of it, and all around on the inside too. and yet it looks like a great big mud pie. i really don't - don't know how to put it all together. it cer- tainly doesn't have the characteristics of - any kind of a violently explosive thing. and i get to looking around at some of these other craters, and i was speculating on whether or not they're - the fact that everything is soft back here on the back side and how that compares to the front side. you know i guess one of the things that strikes me is that everything back here really isn't that soft. it - it's soft in that the colors are - are very uniform and the - -"

"and i'm giving the lcru another zap here. boy, i tell you, i ain't going to do much more dusting after i leave here. ever."
"well, that's because he's - yes, he's unplugged. give him a chance to get hooked up and change some leads here."
okay; 25 and 26. and you've got auto.
"roger. roger. the terminator is going to go right across it on the next pass, right across the eastern edge of eratosthenes."
you're supposed to give us that.
okay; great.
yes. a little bit further out.
"it's ll o'clock up here, too, bob. there's a square boulder - look at that one!"
109.
...
"okay. we saw some droplets speeding out for a little while, jack. now we don't see anything."
let me - let me -
"roger, jack. the latitude is minus 21.62; longitude is minus 16_.37, and this goes in conjunction with that midcourse 7 pad you gave us."
"dave, we're real good on the time, if you'll just stand by a second. you'll carry the etb up with you, i guess."
"good number, i guess, huh? ..."
"roger. 05 22 05 35 _4p 02 connectors, three, locked?"
(laughter). in between the other things? it's a short one. it shoulcln't take me a second.
"kind of tough, huh?"
"roger, ready."
"no, joe, i didn't see a thing. and, it's just all the same (laughing), north and south, east or west in our current position."
fill up that ditty bag with everything we can walk out of here with.

okay - -
"casper, houston. standing by."
but i got to see it ...; it kept going on those charts. that was great (laughter).
"okay, we panicked there, i guess, or we got our - change, we - because we saw you go voice, off, and we wanted to talk to you guys about two or three things before you went to bed. for one thing, we don't see the cabin pumped up yet with the 0ps as per plan and we don't have the onboard read-outs yet, and we'd like to find out who's going to be on the comm and talk to ron about his headset. i guess the general concensus of opinion down here, unless we know more about the fix, is there are some possible serious consequences, like blowing up the audio panel, if those wires did get together and short out, depending on which wires they are. so there's some concern about that."
he's probably spilling coffee in span.
"that was the suit loop we were checking yesterday up in orbit, though."

"yes, bob. i not only will comment - i was aware of it, and i was looking for it. and during parts of the s-ii and parts of the s-ivb burn, i even turned the lights down in the cockpit - in hopes that i could see stars out there; but i could not make out a one. ron, i think, may have saw saturn out the overhead hatch; but looking through the rendezvous window, during a boost phase and during a time-critical phase like a mode ii or mode iv, i am very much afraid that we would not have been able to pick up that reference."
"3000 miles to go, gang; 33,971 feet a second, charlie."
"no, the next step is utility power, on."
"i'd say the color of the - the local surface is (tranq) very comparable to that we observed from orbit at this sun angle, about l0 degrees sun angle, or that nature. it's pretty much without color. it's gray, and it's a very white, chalky gray, as you look into the zero-phase line; smd it's considerably darker gray, more like a ash - ashen gray as you look out 90 degrees to thc s_m. the - some of the surface rocks in close here that have been fractured or disturbed by the rocket engine plume are coated with this light gray on the outside; but where they've been broken, they display a dark - very dark gray interior; and it looks like it could be country basalt. 04 07 lh 02 cc roger, tranquility. we see the noun 93, verb 34."

okay. hold on for 30 seconds.
"okay, i was going to try to recover there from that last few statements. as i recall, the weather briefings that we had at the cape last week, that - talking with ken nabor and jim nicholson do_n there, that the patterns we were seeing from the satellite pictures in their forecast - or analysis anyway, charts in the new zealand part of the pacific, those waves formed along the front would move north and then curve east. and that appears to be the pattern that was visible in one of the older fronts. and i suspect if that pattern would hold with the wave that's developed off the coast - right on the coast of new zealand now, that it might move on up the western coast of new zealand. we'll probably have a chance to watch that the next few days and see what happens to it."
where are the rest of the cue cards?
"hey, that would be good - that would be good, ken."
"houston, columbia. the docking tunnel index angle remains unchanged."
"i tell you where you need to go, pete. okay, that's good. now you need to point - you need to rotate the whole thing counterclockwise. that's good. you're getting there - getting there. that old earth's just hanging up there."
say again.
"okay. real good. and with that precaution, think we can concur on that decision."
okay. copy that.

"hey, challenger; america. are you still with me? okay; i got something like, ""yes."" c_ okay, i just wanted to make sure on the voice check if we still have the vhp problem."
"bob, i might summarize my impression of the rilles in the vicinity of euler and their relationship to the mare ridges. i've been able to, over the last day - just generally searching it out, i've been able to find rilles that clearly cross and separate portions of ridges. and ridges that clearly cross and partially bury rilles. and in another third case, a rille that appears to be levied - that is, have banks of - flat banks on either side, but near the end of it, it transitions into a mare ridge, very clearly. it looks as if, to me, tha_ the rille and ridge problem in here is just one of repetitive compression and extension within the surficial flows of the imbrium basin. and that possibly during the compressive stages, there were extrusions locally along the ridge system, but in the main part, the ridge systems represent, i think, a doming it looks like just a doming of the mare surface except for these local ridgelike extrusions."
yeah. was sort of a - what we're up on now is a sort of a pre-rim rim of this impact crater. and it's - it's - it's 600 meters from the rim.
"negative, gordo. i got tied up in that vhf check."
"now, i've got to go over here and ... we got to move this whole thing to get it."
go ahead.
"yes, i got it. hey, bob. i got my rock. it's halfway between the sep and the lm. wait, wait. let me put it in the big bag - in the big bag."
"mark. gene again. both eyes. this time the same flashes on the horizon, but they don't seem to be moving out of both eyes. tend to be up at the tops of both eyes. just rapid, sequential, lightninglike flashes. and they've stopped."

okay.
"ground test bag number 3 wasn't the one you had to drive in with, was it? cml° yes."
"roger, ron. we'll give you a call. you can go on to bravo now, ron."
i can still see those dark halo craters down there. i'm going to have to look at them with the binocs sometime.
i think this is where it's - where it's bad.
"roger, 18."
okay. let's see. where was that supposed to go?
yes. it doesn't chatter any more in the - in the push to cabin valve.
"roger, jim. we think a shorting switch m_y have been inadvertently depressed. could you take a look at that for us, please?"
"gordy, while the p57 is doing its gravity work, let me say that the lna and the landing site, 'from a relief point of view, i - i think, are identical. i - i couldn't say enough for the lna. i actually didn't look around nearly as much as i thought i would, or as i wanted to, because i had fixation on - on a reasonable spot to land. they're not all reasonable in that there's some very subtle hl_mmocky-like craters right in and around where we are. and there's not a - a lot of boulders laying on the surface, but there's a lot of what appear to be boulders that are covered up by some of the dark mantle. numerous enough that you would not like to take a chance at putting a - a pad down on one of them or in one of those hnmmocky subtle craters. as a result, i really didn't have a chance to look all around at where i wanted to except to put the bird down where i wanted it."
"... you get a little peeved, i'll tell you that."
"hey, we're going to have to do a lot of - what did you do, fall over?"
"yeah, i think you ought to just use - your scoop or something for a gnomon."

"houston, we just wanted you to know that the heart rates you're seeing or not seeing are due to the exercise period, not the iss lights, although that could be a factor."
"yes, go ahead. and be advised that your stars should be good as published."

"okay, orion. i'm going to maneuver to the undock- ing attitude."

"yes, i think we are t_lking to you guys through the lm right now, and how about a speed reading?"
then we can start working on that ... i'd like to do that landing site thing - the p24.
"okay, in step 6, use a minus 0.30 degrees a second, and 3.0 degrees in noun 79."
"and, as a matter of fact, i have - mount la hire seems to be in view now and looks like i'm heading right at it."

"and, dave, you can put the - your shadow off the rover at about 9:30. it should work."
"oh, okay. should we just do a verb 93 now for the heck of it anyhow?"
"this hole out here - you know, this is just such an easy site to find out and to identify yourself on and to land in. but, i tell you, all of a sudden there is so many local holes that i can't think big enough."
"yeah, we're gonna break it."
"beautiful, dave. and did you copy park down-sun, give us the readings, and we'll aline the nav sys- tem when you press on towards station 9."
i'm 3.75. 0_ 11 29 59 cdr mark it.

"hey, gordy. that sounds essentially what we were thinking about. we hadn't got to the extent of trying to hook them up yet, you know, put them together yet, but we're thinking along the same lines anyhow. and you brought up a couple of points that are good."
what is that?
and we observed it here. endeavour.

"okay. but we're going to have to make a configura- tion setting before we start the eva, because we won't be able to get to it then. if we can find a' place where it looks good, i'd like to leave it in manual throughout the eva, and we can try the auto feature some other time."
"that's correct, ken. and as you can probably deduce from the noun 34, right at ]51:34, you should say ""start pitch rate."" and the attitude for that is ""221, 114 underlined slash 138, 000."""
"well, we're going to be doing lalande right there when they're doing all that anyway. why can't we do lalande - why can't we do this?"

"vance, we've got to realize that we've got to establish a work-rest cycle up here, so we just can't wait around here to just read procedures all the time up to the burn. wetve got to get them up here, look at them, and then we've got to get the people to sleep. so take that into consideration when you get ready to send up the pads."
"okay. is that - is that all for about 10 minutes, please?"
okay. what were you getting ready to ask?
it was really a super burn. right on the money.
okay.

"okay, karl. i'm ready to talk sim bay; but first, a couple of questions."
"i'm looking at lassell c and the little highlands clu_np that's by it. and - remember, we had a red and a blue color difference, and right now tne southern pease with a crater in it is sort of a - a tan color, and the northern pease is a gray. when i look at the mare, i see a big swatch of - of the tan-colored mare down to the south that goes ove_? towards guericke. and i see a - a tongue of darker gray material. the area around lassell c has the tan tone to it. then it goes out about as far as our little cone and the little bright crater ne_ to it. that's about the outer linmit - maybe jus_ a little beyond. then there's a patch of the - of this tan stuff that's down to the souvh that about lines up w_ith the big archean rille that's over to the southeast. then there's a _atch _n the gray-celored mare down inside of that. it's just a little circular piece. in looking at the lassell c feature - a look at it in detail - i_ appears to me that this van s_uff on _he scuvh end of it has fewer craters than _he stuff on the north, although not an awful lot, but there's ii_t!e pitted craters all over the northern part. u]_ey'r_ not on the southern part_ and there are _ c_u_ie _"" light, streaked bands that appear in _he seu_hern clump that you don't see in the north. 06 0_ 01 31 cc can you still see lassell? 06 04 o1 37 cm_ say again, hank."
"okay, joe. we'll do all that. how about putting it on a - on a time basis for me so i can write it in the flight plan. _ 08 o0 50 44 cc okay, real fine. you can start that right now at - just put it in at 192:52, i guess. and also, right after that, list fuel cell purge h20 dump and lioh canister change."
"roger, challenger. read you weak but clear. how do you read?"
"well, look at the two here. yes, this one."
"16, houston. we're about 2 minutes from los."
"okay. my gloves are off. you need some help? you got yours, huh?"
okay. we sure will. thanks.
"that's a shame. what time is it, anyhow? let me get over here and get a big picture of this."
"i'll tell you, that rover is a pretty picture out there."
okay. verify the following. check your helmet and visor.
"okay. apollo 13, houston. you have a go for all systems, and the 02 flow high check is nominal with the waste tank vent open at this time, and it's no sweat."
roger.
it's clean now. _4p oh. (laughter) gmp one 0ps_ stowed.
here's that crater. we're down here. we got to go there.
"challenger_ houston. we'd like you to put the ascent batteries on according to the procedures on the next _a_e, 8-8, just a little early because of pre-conditioning noticed in - _efore descent. and we checked your rgas during the hot fire, and your hot fire itself, and they both looked good."
"z""je done that."
"houston, 15."
okay.
"better do something about that, charlie."
put - put this baby in the big bag. it's dirt.
i mean to tell you.
"one time. that disappeared, too? that probably went into orbit."
"well, that's right interesting. on the zodiacal light, i got it done and took the last frame just as the sun - i took the frame and it said stop the tape and the sun came up. so, i guess that all worked out pretty good. in the process, i missed the settings for a quarter of a second and possibly one of them for a half because when i turned the filter, it came off. and i figured there wasn't any sense in taking it with the filter in other than its 90-degree positions. but the rest of the stuff - managed to get don_ on time and we rolled out at 31:09 and turned the mapping camera, on, at 31:09. so, you missed about 6 seconds."
"okay, well_ i got to - let's see, i've got to get that solar wind, huh?"
... down and power down ...
"yes, i don't either, tony. we'd get the dust from the front fender, then, probably."
"well, let's see--"
"i'm hung up on something. ]- ---c$ ;4:' 7;rzl,"
"haven't really seen any large enough that - that we'd call rhysling, joe."
"hey, could you get me a little piece of tape ...?"
"it's 104:30:08.54, al."
"18,100, fido says."
"well, let me answer the last one first. i - i guess i didn't come in soon; i came in when the job was done. and, as a matter of fact, i made an extra trip back out to take a look at the map- ping camera. now as - as far as what i felt like when i went out there, we talked a little bit about it after - after the eva and decided it was sort of like walking on stage at your high school - dinner dance or something. we opened the hatch and it was pitch black, and as soon as we got out, the sun was beating down on everything, and it looked like a very large floodlight on a stage. and then putting the tv camera out on the door just added a little bit more to that sort of unreal feeling that it was time to get out on the stage and do something. i think, as far as the eva went, we - we did it just almost exactly as we'd practiced it. it took almost exactly the same amount of time; we did it the same way. and, of course, we had practiced out with the pan - with the mapping camera in the extended position, and so that - that really posed no difficulty to us."
"gene, i'm going to go up and look at this one rock. why don't you set up and sample any one of these other big ones. they're all the same. like the one near the rover. and i'll go up and try to get this big one down there."
"affirmative. and on page 2-22, item 2, change ""shutter 1/15 - 2 frames"" to ""shutter 1/2 - 2 frames."""
"and, tony, we used only 5 percent on - it went from l0 to 15 percent on magazine fl{."
"i can't see right now, but i think i've still got you right in the center."
"i hate to tell you this, but i think it's indurated regolith."
"okay, we copy."
"yes, yes, i can close it."
"okay, houston; 15. both hatch seals are clean, and both hatches are now closed and locked. do you want to vent the tunnel again?"
"okay. okay, jack, they're both in."
"okay; and like the rest of the spacecraft, the platform's beautiful; there's no drift compensation or pipa bias update. over."

"okay, houston, i looked - i'm looking at the con- trast chart in the shadow; and, as i mentioned at 3 feet, i can see all six. if i back up maybe to 10 feet, as long as i stand here a moment and adapt nv eyes, i can see all six also. now, the thing that seems to have the biggest effect on it is how low the sun is. the sun is high now and so i don't have to squint my eyes particularly, looking in that direction. yesterday, looking into the same crater, even though it wouldn't be any darker in there because the sun was there, i could - i would never be able to adapt. right now, i can see all six marks, and i've taken the photographs. going to go out and do solar wind now ."

"let me help you. okay, baby."
"oh, okay. well, i better come there first, i guess."
roger.
"everybody is shaking their head; i guess it's okay. about the time you get to the hatch, we'll think of something."
yes. that's right.
chips. let me get a piece of the rock it's in. and i'm going to take a closeup stereo of that.
"gordy, this is jack. i just went off biomed briefly."
on the yaw needle?
we didn't get my - we didn't get me a vector. can you do that now?
copy that.
"ken, most of the things they've seen today are breccia again. they did find one rock they thought was crystalline, but there's some doubt _out it."
"you're off. i'll lay that there. where's your water? here it is, way over here."
what's that?
got a big glass splotch on it.
"yes, i am."
] wasn't noticing jim too much. i'd say i put in maybe about six or seven inputs. i don't think it ever got off more than a couple of needle widths.
"okay. vi is - i got a 00 and a 00 and noun 95 vi is 35573 - is a plus 9. and, bob, the _s is minus - ems is minus 19.4, minus 19.4."

okay. i'm going to get a close - a couple of cross-sun stereos is all. is that all right?
that was very good.
"okay. it's looking through the aot in position 4, right rear. and we're looking back toward the - over the side hatch at the aft side of the service module."
yes. let's go over in there.

"and some more on this configure. we're coming up here on los. apparently, it's important that the dse be configured on a - a time. it depends on when they start to rewind. so for this rev, they want you to configure the dse at 150:45."
we all know that they don't respond that fast down at mcc anytime.
"we thought we might, dave."

"that's good, jack. sample is in 42 yankee."
how about that - how about that - whew - how about that piece?
"okay, we'll go ahead and go the - and do the imu fine align right now, if that's okay with you, houston."
all four buses open.
"okay, jack. you're on?"
would i be allowed to take a picture out here? (laught er)
"roger. 30:13, delete, and in fact, all the other items from here on out are deletes. and i'll go through them quickly. 30:13, delete battery charge a termination; 30:15, delete h2 purge line heaters, on; 30:18, delete exit g&n ptc; 30:23, delete - if sps mcc required and the references to pan and mapping cameras - the things, in fact, that you moved ahead; 30:35, delete h2 and 02 fuel cell purge and waste water dump; and, finally, 30:50, delete h2 purge line heaters, off. over."

"roger, nell. starting off: congratulatory messages on the apollo ll mission have been pouring into the white house from world leaders in a steady stream all day. among the latest are telegrams from prime minister harold wilson of great britain and the king of belgium. the world's press has been dominated by news of apollo ll. some newsmen estimate that more than 60 percent of the news used in papers across the country today concerned your mission. the new york times which, as we mentioned before, has had such a demand for its edition of the paper today (even though it ran 950 000 copies) said it will reprint the whole thing on thursday as a souvenir edition. and premier alexei kosygin has sent congratulations to you and president nixon through former vice president humol_ey who is visiting russia. the cosmonauts have also issued a statement of congratulations. humphrey quoted kosygin as saying ""i want you to tell the president and the american people that the soviet union desires to work with the united states in the cause of peace."""

"okay, bob, the boulder downslope is more of a light-gray vesicular boulder. the one jack just talked about with some of the larger white inclu- sions is less vesicular, and it's a - more of blue- gray rock. and if i don't fall on my tail here, i'll get - -"
"it just so happens that's what we were taj_king about now. there is a little bit of dampnes around the outside edge of the hatch, out a very, very slight amount. we've got a hose up there that we're hoping will sort of help keep it a little bit dry. (goss net 1) tape 100/7"
"- - on the forward and off scale low, and 220 on the right rear."
and 34 volts on the charge.
... awhile.
"okay. ha, ha. you know what i did on that camera? i forgot it. i wound it up in there. i haven't had a chance to take the film out yet. but i wound it back in the can (chuckle)."
"this side looks okay, dave."
okay. now_ at this point_ you have this section marked up already_ so what i give you now repre- sents additional deltas to your previously marked up checklist.
roger. and also a surprise. they didn't see any evidence of bedding in the crater anywhere they looked.
"okay, i'll get it."
"okay. below ""guidance control, ags,"" the third step should be changed to be mode control, both, to att hold."
that's deleted.
"okay, nobody touch my heat flow. that's the prettiest job i've ever done. okay, i'm going behind a boulder over here. bob, i'ye got about 385; and, i guess, about 50 percent. i can't see it too well."
we taped the back.
wait until we get up here.
i see no loops or obvious alignment that would be related to that crater. there are blocks - look like great big blocky areas on the rim.
"okay. pre-tei-64, sps/g_n; 38 - 3 - 38332; plus 0.61, plus 0.95; 200:33:20.44; plus 3265.6, plus 0808.0, minus 0215.1; 180, 000, 000; plus 21.7, plus 3371.0-- time skip"
"that's affirm. and underneath ""set event timer,"" add the following: verb 25 noun 07, enter; 1257, enter."
go ahead.
ah-oh.
"15, houston. we hear that your attitude is very good right now; there's no need to trim the maneuver."
"we ought to be coming right into daylight here, huh? where's the tunnel?"
"okay, down."
okay.
"well, they think it might be up here."
okay.
okay. we're up to about 2.6 agc now.
okay.
that's right. so it - -
"(laughter) hey, come on, i'm getting tired of picking up those little things."
"very good. thank you for the message, bob."
"hey, we've been using the purge valves interchange- ably. i don'_ know who was using whose when we were out on the moon."
"roger, charlie. copy auto shutdown."
i've already cycled film.
okay. ops 02 .
"okay, it's about l0 minutes _way from the morning."
"oh - me; oh, my. the material *** dike looks - yes, it is, it is, it's not covering it. it's between the - it's between the - lighter-colored rock, and it's the blue-gray rock."
locke.
"houston, were you able to record the documentary way where the two core tube samples were taken?"
"it's measuring right now, jack, we'll get it later. cdr-ev_ ail right."
okay. outstanding and visor down.
"hello, america; houston. over."
"14, houston. everything's looking perfect here. 00 00 10 17 cml° roger."
you take it.
okay. four seconds to final comp.
"okay, a1 and ed. i guess we can skip the rim of north crater amd proceed right on back to the lm are a."
good thing we've practiced this a few times. i tell you what. why don't you let me hold it for you? okay?
that's the one you have to strain to make out.
"right, except where that lm is. 06 04 5_ 29 lmp-eva except right there where that lm is."
go by that little dark crater over there. there's - a very blocky-rim small crater that's a dark-rim crater instead of a bright rim like we'd seen some around that looked fresh. it partly may be the angle at which we're approaching it.
"we got the earth in the top of this thing. that was a y, jack, do you concur?"
"okay, we'll purge. are you going to time her?"
"our fender's beginning to fade; and, uh-oh, the clip came off on the inside; that's what's wrong. we'll have to fix that before we start. the out- side ones hold but the inside one's not."
"yes, that's earth study ... lunar sounder and the middle gimbal - -"
"okay. we'll let her run, one frame a second - -"
i got it open. but - *** wish i had a mirrsr.
i think we're about a half ...
"fred, houston."
roger .... understand. stand by.
"oh, your's is in a circle."
"that is a great rock. okay, john, could you - when you get around there, could you give me a film mag, black and white?"
"okay. we're rolling, and i'd like the range and bearing to the next -"
"hey, why don't you just sort of sneak up so you doa't sprinkle any dirt down in the bottom of this place where we turned it over. 06 04 14 50 _mp-eva yeah, okay."
"well, try."
minus 60300.
roger.
"okay .... 08 23 58 27 new recovery, new orleans. red, est astronaut voice refort from apollo lb. over. 08 23 58 33 r ro_er. wait 1. apollo 14, apollo ih; this is recove_y. over."
okay.
- - use the cables we've got?
"okay. no, wait a minu - -"
i think there is a considerable amount of truth to that.
"no, you can't do a thing. i have to get off - and unhook it from this cannon plug down here."
"roger. we've been having a little bit, thunderstorm-type, the last couple of days. we had a pretty good rain today, smd it's been overcast. a slow storm system's been moving through the area in the last couple c_' days, and primarily evening and a_ernoon th_idershowers."
"okay. and hf number 2. 3, 2, i -"
... 07 22 33 19 c_4p (laughter)
"okay, that sounds good to us. could you tell us whether the north-facing side of the central station can see any portion of the rtg?"
"you're looking good now, casper. 04 08 14 28 cm_° okay, hank. tell me again what you just said about the cdus. 0_ 08 !4 34 cc okay, we're getting some bad data down here, so really we can't be sure. it looks like you ought to be about 28550. is that right? 0_ 08 14 46 cmip correet."
...
"and, 17, i'll be unable to update that aos time, but 52:20 is looking good."
okay. i'll have to schedule a little discus- sion after i get back.
locked.
"0kam, you got a g!mbal lock and n'.}att. did you get an iss warning? o1 lk 27 19 cmp no, sir; i did net."
"roger. we've finished picking up data on the mass spectrometer. leave the d_scriminator as it is, and we're ready to go to put the experiment in standby now."
"okay. next, what we want is some heat flow - okay. we just got late word. they'd like to do it one more time, and then call it _uits."
"okay. we had a handover, but that was about a half an hour ago, and i didn't call you on it. let me check with inco and see if he thinks everything's okay. your comm sounds just as good as it's ever been."
"okay. we'll talk about the reason for that in a second. i've got one more line in your pd0 check- list, and then we can discuss some things. on page 5-5, it's in the cleanup column there, about halfway - no, almost to the pro underneath the line that reads ""circuit breakers sps pitch i and yaw l, open,"" insert ""circuit breakers sps pilot valve main b, open."""
"now, let's - can i put a bag around it?"
okay. did you happen to notice if there was a 1-1/2-inch hole visible in the upper left-hand corner of the upper panel?
you carried my lunch; i carried your card.
notice that white colored rock there that we just went o- -
okay. the purpose for these were - was to protect the e-memory from other programs.
"okay. i'll go to transmit, joe."
"negative. now we just want you to go to the plus-x sim bay. 05 04 25 _3 cmp or just to the - okay, fine."
"abort/abort stage are reset. 07 17 16 01 lm_-lm attitude control, three, to mode control."
"i got it. okay, i'm locked up, al."
"well, that's groovy. 04 13 29 13 _ ... electrical thingamajigs to get in here. you're supposed to put it - in back of the front window. you want to do it?"
i thought you had some magic numbers you had to set it to.
"good, charlie."
"200 to 250, it should be."
"yes, it's gonna be - okay, you want me to pull bat a and b circuit breakers?"
"that sounds good to us, jim. it's not worth the trouble."
...
"yes, you got to check it out though (laughter)."
that's roger; we have that.
"15, this is houston. are - are we in comm now?"
you want us - -
"okay. ail right. 05 07 tl 09 cmp okay. volts are 39.4, amps, 1.25."
thank you. 0b 07 56 _1 cdr i might add that both of those alternatives have been - worked on.
"yes, i thought that was a real smooth ride. real smooth. okay. let's keep pressing ahead here. slowly but surely. how you doing, ed? 00 o0 43 15 i2_p okay. proceeding through my systems check."
"no. it - only around the lm, it was just in alsep, it was just in spots. at buster, it - correction - at plum, it seemed to be everywhere, and everywhere we dug a little scoop, my predom- inant impression was that the white albedo was coarser grained th_ the fine dust-covered on top."
"it's like - you know - well, i thought what was going to happen for a minute there .... , you know, i got the strange feeling that we were going to wind up in orbit with a spacecraft that had no electrical power."
"charlie, whatever you do, don't hit that brake."
"16, in the situation we're in now, we've only got one omni that we can read, and we can't command. so we're cnly getting about 11 minutes of low-bit- rate data out of every 18 while you're in ptc. it's possible - we might lose you; if so, just stand by and we'll pick you ap again."
"okay, and it's dark beneath the thermal covering?"
okay.
take the lens shade off?
"deke says get a night's sleep. he says you've been working hard, and you ought to relax a little bit and be ready for tomorrow."
"oh, yes. i24p-eva and i'll try to get a reading on what it is - some pictures of it as we come up to it."
roger. copy.
"okay, dave ......"
the rover makes it feel so easy.
"the l_fortunate thing about it, houston, is that rascally rim - it goes down - it slopes into it abo_; - say, 10 or 15 degrees. it's the kind of slope i'm standing on right now, and then all of a sudden, in order to see to the bottom, i've got to walk another 100 yards down a - a 25- to 30-degree slope, and i don't think i'd better. maybe we can drive around to the other side and see clown into it."
okay.
"i think so, too."
okay.
"apollo 15, houston. if you have a chance, we'd like to t_lk to dave and jim about this lcg con- nector problem sometime. 08 07 b4 37 cdr okay, stand by."
"okay, vance, continue."
"okay, hank. thank you, sir."
"roger. that's - that's our feelings here, jack."
okay. i'll see if there's any deltas to that. it'll take me a couple of minutes.
6.41 is still elevation. stand by - -
"you see that? ... a boulder, a hole."
okay.
"okay, orion, you don't need any further data for the p56, do you?"
"boy, that's really - we sure saw it on descent. i don't see it right now. there's a bright ray - a bright crater to the right, maybe 50 meters of what i think is spook, which is probably buster, but i really wouldn't swear to it."
"boy, i don't like losing that fender. i_p-eva we're back at the sep, bob. i'm starting to lay out my first track."
okay.
"... 60, 000.52."
"yeah, i see them. yeah, yeah. emmmmmmmawmi"
"are you sure, jim?"
"okay, guys, it's time for another try on the hf antenna."
"boy, the sun moves pretty fast, doesn't it? moltke was in the damn - was moltke in the termi- nator?"
a jillion stars.
"no, we did not send v-data. eagle. over."
"i do, i do, i do."
the ...! that biomed is working.
