... right over. got it in the sextant?
"yes, sure have."
isn't that interesting! why don't you look back in the telescope?
"i have. it's not in the telescope, pete,"
"well, you got a lot of daylight on you, still, out there, dick."
"i couldn't see a damn thing in the telescope, and i don't see any star right now."
"okay, ... - -"
that thing's right smack - great big one - right smack in front of ...
okay.
what's that - hitting me in the shoulder?
which shoulder?
right.
"hey, a1 bean?"
"yes, sir."
"- - our cabin heat's down, isn't it? it's 5.4."
"yes, it's okay. i was checking it a minute ago; it looks okay."
"i've got my ... pencils ready to go, here."
...
12-1/2 - two stars ... 45 - -
?nat's okay ....
- - should be fomalhaut.
all that stuff is in there just perfect. ail con- nected. this camera looks like it's ready to - -
"pete, i used star number 1 - -"
"ail right, just a minute. let me write all this good stuff down."
- - which is aipheratz and star number 45 which is fomalhaut.
star number 1 and star number 45. yes?
"okay, and he's in the middle of this sextant."
that's beautiful. that's beautiful.
but he's sure not ... 00 01 59 36 i24p that's ... 00 0t 59 39 cmp right in the center of the sextant.
should be getting something out of this - it's the best look i got and i can't get any ... too much of a - -
"there you go. all balls. now, you're learning, dick gordon."
(laughter) i appreciate that.
look at the torquing angles.
"okay, there you go."
"oh, ho, ho, ho, is that beautiful. minus three balls 14, minus three balls 28."
plus three balls 18.
plus three balls 18.
two hours and 20 seconds -
mark.
two plus 20 - plus 20.
and i'll do a star check. _--- day 1  _' page 19
"ail right, and i'm going to go ahead and do the gdc align - while you're doing all that good stuff."
"uh-oh. well, that's all right."
yes. 00 02 00 35 cml 405. no stars available - -
"available, yes."
how do you do a verb 307 i always get stopped by ...
that's done.
"well, there ought to be a star out there - -"
"no, we just ..., there's not much - -"
there's not any stars since we ...
that's not a pair; see. i'm just going start ... now - -
ail right. now - -
proceed and enter - -
no. enter. enter. o0 02 o0 59 cml why?
"well, you could call up a star."
i don't want to use the same one i'm doing; see.
"oh, isn't there another star that's in that area?"
no. alpheratz and fomalhaut - -
... make a pair?
"how about - i wonder if enif would be there? that's on the other side of - well, let's see if enif would - -"
you could enter and load enif.
"now, let's see, here. enif - i think we could do that. 44 is enif. shaft is - is 18; trunnion is 45. i don't - 181 and 45 - i don't know if i'll make that or not. we will shortly, though. no, it's going out - yes, there it is. right in the middle of the cross- hairs."
we got - yaw drift.
who has?
dick does - - 00 02 0t 53 lmp ...
yes. it's - -
and that little old star enif is right in the middle of the sextant.
you must have wanted it quite - quite extensively. 00 02 02 01 cml that sextant is gorgeous. in the middle of the sextant. but i sure don't have anything in the tele - no wonder i had a hard time the first time around.
"yes, if you look out in the daytime, you see what you see."
huh?
"look out that thing in the daytime, you ... see ... terrible."
"man, i'm telling you there isn't anything in the telescope. and that star is as bright as it can be in that sextant."
"well, be glad it's that way and not the other way. program alarm again."
"it's going out past 50 degrees, that's all right ... go to zero optics. little hot."
"yes, but now i'm cooling off a little."
cabin temp in auto. i'm going to put this thing in - - _ day 1 page 21
cabin tr_p in auto?
"- - back to p00 in this, and i'm going to stow these optics for this - -"
"dick gordon, should i put the cabin temp in aut_?"
yes. you going to cool it off?
yes.
huh?
... bag.
... there you go.
"hey, the way to do - is to learn to housekeep in this thing. hey, dick gordon?"
"yes, sir."
"when we trade seats, we're going to have to ..."
"yes, sir."
ail right .... lot of space.
...
"yes, ... that's really something else."
that's was what - i was really enjoying that ride. it was a very comfortable one.
i loved that first ... - -
oh - - 00 02 03 5h cdr - - for 45 seconds.
yes.
i couldn't even believe that.
i couldn't either. i thought they were kidding me (laughter).
i thought - -
"the best part of all was a1 bean kept saying, back there this little voice kept saying, ""i have power on my buses; i have power on my buses"" (laughter). o0 02 04 ll _ (laughter)"
and i kept looking at all those lights and ... - -
no wonder the shaft and trunnion ...
huh? o0 02 04 19 cml i had the shaft and trunnion ...
"you zero the optics? is it in cmc or in manual? · 00 02 04 30 cml cmc. all right, optics, zero."
funny how slow you think up here.
there they go. 00 02 04 42 cml ...
"it just takes you a while to get going, that's all. 00-02 04 52 lmp it does."
"... 00 02 05 o0 cml it's not a natural environment, my friend. you haven't been here before. neither has anybody else, for very long. get that freaker in there somehow or another, where it's going to stay - until some- body ... it - -"
"you're not going to leave it there for tli, are you?"
"oh, no, i just want to set it there, now. i want - i got to figure out what i got to do, so i'll be ready."
"..., how about radiators, water ... and all those - -"
i'll check - i'll check them again. put that in there.
"hey, you got some room to put some goodies up in your place? how about putting this lunar landmark map up - up there in the stowage place?"
"yes, that's a good idea ...."
get all that in ... in the overhead right now.... check the - -
put that up there.
eds power; translunar inject. eds power is on.
here's a couple more.
"yes, all right. 00 02 05 54 _ if you want to get out the card book, i'll get out the proper card."
for what?
for tv and stuff.
what cards are that? do you have cards for tv?
for that camera and stuff. you've got to start taking pictures. 00 02 06 07 cml okay.
...
... bright ... and i'm at the same place on that card as i am in this book.
see if we got any other place ...
you want any other ... - here it is.
... that card? yes. let me have the - the burn card.
what burn card?
sps burn.
"here, you play with this."
"all right, i will, but i'll hand it back to you."
"all right, what's the cabin stabilizing at?"
the third light - -
"it's down to 553, now."
i know what it looks like.
what did we say we're going to stabilize at?
4.9 or something?
had a rate valve that was high.
"boy, i heard that ..."
that was the last thing i heard.
"that was the last thing i heard, too, because that was about the time all the lights came on. i was saying to myself at the time, ""bean, you're sure cool to notice that."" right on schedule, i was watching it at 25 seconds."
"you were really proud of yourself, huh? 00'02 07 15 lmp oh, it was great up to there (laughter). i got to go back - -"
"well, we got everything back, gang."
- - i got to go back for a second ride just to see oops again (laughter).
"if there's one like that again, i don't think you'll really want to go back, do you?"
(laughter) it didn't bother me that badly.
"there was nothing you could do; you were just a ..., i told you i was ... at the time. what else do you need, al?"
"that's it, i - -"
"you can throw that bag away then, pal. get rid of it. p_ day 1 _ page 25"
make sure that's all of it.
"i knew we were going in - i don't even think - dick gordon said something about that tower, and i was still watching."
"you see that tower go up, that's - -"
"yes. yes, i kind of glanced up and saw that disappear."
i looked out some on the launch to see it.
"i didn't know where we were, what we were doing; i just knew that 3:18 was time to get rid of the tower (laughter)."
"listen, i hope i got everything locked up, gang. i won't vouch for it."
that'll make it - (laughter) that'll give them something to write about tonight (laughter).
"boy, there's a lot of it. 00 02 08 20 cm_p yes."
... starch.
"hey, where did all that come from?"
what's that?
"well, you just bent over and some real nice cold air - is it coming out of your suit? yes. oh, man, is that nice!"
"you like that, huh?"
yes.
when - when do we do tli?
tli comes - time base 6 comes - -
i'm going to leave this chair flat.
"shoot; 2 hours and 6 minutes ago, you'd have been sat- isfied with a safe abort. now, you want to do tli."
the what abort?
(laughter) safe abort.
"oh, safe abort."
time base 6 starts at 02:37:42.
"hey, we're almost there now. you want to use this handy-dandy little program in the computer?"
might as well.
and get all good things done?
"i'm down at - i'm down at carnarvon aos 02:25, where i push in the direct ullage breakers; i got the event timer set to 51, and then the ... - -"
... stay up there or what?
no.
"al, baby, you put that in block."
"i can't - i can, now that i've cleaned out some of that junk. 00'02 09 18 cmp ... back to a96."
"light flash, what's all that junk, ..."
"you sure don't hear those service module engines, but you - -"
i see - you see those rcs flash; there's another one.
that's got to be the s-ivb. 00 02 09 34 _ yes. everybody said they saw them.
"i got a bunch of stars out my window, now. let me see. anybody i recognize? upside down, looking out - - o0 02 09 45 cma that's the problem. i don't know what attitude i was in."
looking south.
i couldn't believe all that .... looking - looking ...
why don't we get some string ...?
you want some - you want some string?
i want ...
yes. wait until after we get on the - -
"- - just kidding, of course, right this minute, but - -"
- - get on to the - to the lm.
- - get this out.
"hey, you know, this is neat. oh, boy! that was a big one."
what was that? lightning flashing on the ground? 00 02 t0 12 cdr no. it's - it's the aps.
"oh, the aids."
"it looks funny, because you - does look like you're horizontal, doesn't it? there's capella."
...
hope the camera's ready .... launch with that eight- ball. 00 02 10 42 _ yes.
and all those lights on.
(laughter)
i couldn't believe it.
yes.
"i couldn't even read the pan - the panels. hell, i said everything's on, a1 - - 00 02 10 50 _ you know one of my first - -"
- - i said you got everything.
"i figured what had happened is that the command module had separated from the service module elec- trically. something like that, i mean, you could ..."
we're off a little.
"yes, i wandered off in yaw just a little."
i wonder why they never gave us that one before.
"yes. sim supe never gave us that, at all."
i don't think they ever expected ... - -
"they never imagined, ..."
"the batteries didn't go, my circuits - -"
"i'll bet - i'll bet they - - 00 02 ll 19 cmp i didn't give you your pad for that thing, did i, al?"
"what pad, dick?"
"your pad. 00,02 ll 24 lmp yes. i didn't take it, because i was trying to get some other things done."
"yes, mine was ... 00 02 ll 28 _ we're supposed to - how far are we from tli?"
an hour and 20 minutes.
"no. we got longer than that. we're in 6, time base 6. o0 02 ll 35 i24p okay. i'm going to take time to look over these circuit breakers a little bit."
"hey, guys, i need a pad because - -"
what do you need?
"well, i want to use that - use that thing for my ..."
okay. you want a countdown on this?
"well, let me read it to you. where is it?"
"let me give you the pad, right here."
"there's that tuning fork again. 00 02 11 53 i24p let me turn to the proper page, here."
i wish somebody could check down in that leb ... before ...
i'll go down there - -
"no. no, you don't have to do that."
"why don't you stick around, here - -"
wait until after the tli.
...
"hey, wait a minute. hang on. get back here. you got your belts all messed up, you got your ... here you go."
what you got these pamphlets here for?
i don't know.
"what do you need on the pad, dick? time base 6 - -"
i need - -
- - starts at 2 hours 37 minutes and 43 seconds.
"37. boy, we're coming ..., now."
"okay. things look good here, gang. i need that, now. look at that a little bit."
(yawn) ...
what ...
"... any more stumbling blocks, today."
tli and get the lm out.
(laughter)
"and we got a couple of p22's to worry about, too."
"oh, you got a problem. got to keep this auto optics running. if you don't - -"
i don't - i hope we don't dump the platform any more.
yes. let's concentrate on that.
"what are you doing down there, dick?"
...
"hey, dick gordon."
what?
"what do you want to do, start this coas, dick?"
"no, no - in that - in that and the optics ..., i want to look at this .... get the whole field of view .... there he is, the belt was right up the very edge of it. 00 b2 13 28 cdr okay."
"and the ... goes down here, and then ..."
... down in the center of ...
yes.
you hate to look at in the daytime.
"dick, you want - you want to start this program, now?"
not - not - not particularly. no.
you want to take this - did you all take off the ...?
"no. hell, just leave everything where it is. we can clean up this whole thing when we get the lm out and get on our way. f_"
that's a good idea.
"we got until 5 o'clock tomorrow morning. o0 02 13 56 limp here, take the flight plan. let me put that up."
is that in the right place?
i don't know. o0 02 14 07 cml i wonder if that erasable program got wiped out?
...
i wonder why it took the fuel cells.
"just disconnected them, that's all it did."
but why and nothing else?
"i don't understand that either,"
we must have gotten some horrendous spike on some ...
"that must have been what done it. they're both spiking simultaneously. because you know, if you spike one up, it takes the fuel cell off the other."
"yes, and if you spike both of them, you got the whole shooting match. i think we just gave off a big static electrical discharge that just drained the spacecraft for about 2 seconds' worth of power, you know, and then it just fell off."
"that must have been it,"
...
"i imagine they can sort it out on their telemetry, dick."
sure they can. o0 02 14 5.5 cdr they'll see what - they'll know when those things came off.
...
"i don't like this strap in the way up here, al."
"well, let's move it."
how about getting locked in for tli?
i thought we had an hour or something or more.
would you believe that tli is at - at 2 - time base 6 is what? 02:36?
seven.
"02:37, so mine ... about 02:47."
when are we going to start - when do we start burning? nine minutes later?
nine minutes after 02:37. 02:46.
do we have ground at ...? 00 02 15 32 cdh we got to; we never got a go.
did you copy the - -
carnarvon at 2 plus 25.
did you copy these - the torquing angles anywhere?
"i have them ready to give to the ground, right here."
okay.
i think we roll first.
"oh, no, you're right. i'm sorry; i didn't see them ..."
"hey, dick, let me look at your book a minute, please."
...
"okay, dick .... you look at yours, and i'll just make sure i got all these things put away."
"... settling back in your couch, get your chair the way you want it."
that's what i'm doing right this second.
you want this card up here any more?
no.
"i even glanced at that baby. i said, ""i can't believe that card's up there and that ac bus 1 light's on"" (laughter)."
what a way to start.
there's a better way.
yes.
"let's hope nothing's wrong with the lm or anything, ... that baby protected - -"
"protected, yes."
"- - it has no power on it whatsoever, now."
why?
"well, the umbilical drops out; and, when the umbilical drops out, it - it - it - it just goes dead on power until we get in."
yes.
"yes - it doesn't have - it doesn't get battery power from the s-ivb. i thought it did, but it doesn't. right, bean-o?"
that's exactly right; it doesn't.
"it's running on internal batteries right now, on low voltage."
"yes, it's running on internal batteries."
uh-oh.
what's the matter?
... falling off the line ... battery.
"yes, they can. they get in that automatic disconnect - -"
"hey, they've got automatic disconnect just like those fuel cells. it's not like - it's not llke this thing, here. we got those ... controls and everything."
... circuit breakers out of there ....
"what would that mean? 00 02 l? 16 lmp that would mean that your imuwouldn't be as good as you thought, but i guess we've - -"
"i mean when we put power back on, we'll get power back on even if those ecas dropped out, wouldn't we?"
yes .... haven't thought of it yet.
"when we undocked here, i guess we need to look at that to make sure that all these things are right for undocking. nobody's been separating that stuff."
... don't know. 00 02 17 55 cml tv camera's ready to go.
"okay, i can eat my sandwich."
high gain antenna angles are ... verify operation ... - right after we turn around. 00 02 18 16 i24p our rcs looks all right.
look at that el; it's pink.
i'm going to look out the window an& ...
turned everything out? okay.
turned everything down.
everything looks good to me.
...
... out there. _--
"have you checked the coas, pete?"
"i didn't check that it works, but i'll turn it on right now and give - yes, zap, does it workl whew/ ... down. super. there you go."
"is that on zero? set it on zero .... 00 02 19 0g cdr it's set on zero, and i presume i got it in the right detent."
...
"coas power, off. boy, these struts are really loose in here, look at them."
yes.
... no way ...
"boy, there's no doubt in your mind when that thing lifts off. that bitch hauls out."
that's what it's supposed to do.
it does. god!
"it seems like it took them a year to say ""tower's clear,"" though."
you were counting the seconds; i was watching the clock.
"yes, they called it way late."
"yes, about 12, 13 seconds - -"
"roll program didn't begin until 32 seconds, either."
"man alive, but it - -"
"yes, it ..."
"... i looked at my clock; it said 43 minutes 15 seconds, and it was stopped. big deal. 00 02 20 00 cml this one was still running ... rolling right along. we took it at 2 ..."
i'd sure like to have somebody standing down there in the leb and see whether it says it on that other clock. it'd make me feel a lot happier.
... check it ....
i'm going to have to force myself to get back to my old habits and relax.
yes.
hand me that book a minute; i'll give it back to you.
"doing that, al?"
not yet.
just relax your - turn loose. you can go to wherever your normal park position is.
"yes, you do, you've got a different place .... over my head."
get that s-ivb broke in.
glad your iu didn't glitch with it.
that would have been something. 00 02 20 57 cml ... pad.
"you know, an interesting thing - what's our oxygen? 60/40?"
yes.
that the way we lifted off?
yes.
"well, you know that thing happened right around the time for cabin relief,"
...
how come that?
"i don't know, was that a water ...? - day 1 page 37 00 02 21 17 cml ... supposed to do that."
what's the cabin?
... 15 seconds - -
"hey, we're venting the cabin, aren't we?"
we're venting the cabin. the vents are open.
"yes, but we shouldn't be doing that, should we?"
"yes, because it's now fallen down to where the - the - -"
"we'll make it up - - 00 02 21 33 ·cmp ... starting to pick up the reg now, isn't it?"
"yes, your waste vent's open and - and that's normal to get the 02 high flow in flight - -"
yes. yes. you ... - -
"you've got the waste vent open down there, and this is how we're purging the cabin. okay?"
yes.
it happens to everybody.
yes.
"except we can record that it happened at 02:21:30. dick, did we - -"
"here, reading the oxygen at - that come out before, we still bleeding off?"
yes. it's bleeding off.
"..,"
... regulate right at the 5 - 5 point - -
"somewhere after tli, i know i get down there and turn that baby - that waste vent off."
and i'll get them off ... - i'll get them off with the circuit breakers and you get over on ...
"yes, you close it after we get out of - do tli."
"man, i recognize - oh, there's my old buddies, alpha and beta centaurus - southern cross. there's the magellanic cloud ..."
there you go. did you align the gdc after i - -
yes. after the platform.
... read out my - -
ail right. i'm going to wait until we get carnarvon; see if they want to do anything to the dsky before · i put the erasable fighres in there.
okay.
"you want the lights on, now?"
no. wait until ...
"man, those thrusters are bright."
that the aps?
...
i thought it was the aps ...... rcs check.
no.
"here, a1 bean .... getting ..."
"okay, and the other thing is, i got to remember to get hot on those propellant valves."
yes ....
why don't we have - i thought - we want those ...?
no. you want the lights up? you want them up?
yes. sure - - _ day 1 % page 39
then let's have them up.
check those after we get off ...
okay. there we go; we got s-band signal .... lock these fellows in ....
you did align the gdc?
"yes. i'm going to direct ullage breakers in, right now."
...
one.
...
two.

"the event timer's still set at 51, and i'm beginning to get monitoring for time base 6. cmp to the couch. i'm waiting for all this good stuff to start."
"hello, houston; apollo 12 over carnarvon."
"apollo 12, houston. loud and clear."
roger. i got some torquing angles for you.
"roger. would you do some work for us? tape recorder, off, and high bit rate."
"ail right. tape recorder, off."
"try again, al, now."
"... okay, gang, ... - - time skip"
doesn)t that make you nervous?
"oh, i see; i was upside down."
yes. everybody's upside down - -
we're - we're upside down. we're going around the world upside down.
"yes. the block's on the top, that's all."
"what happened, dick, is beyond n_ff comprehension."
it's going to be fantastic.
"we're all on our own. okay. how's your - hey, i've got my - repress shows off. that's what it's supposed to be. service module -"
"it looks to me like the radiators and everything are working real well, pete."
glad something's working. 00 02 35 19 omp really got to be careful you don't move the wrong switch ... switch ...
"... yes, sir."
i want to get comfortable for a one-g ...
"no, it takes a while to get to one g, dick."
huh?
start out about three-quarters of a g. you get settled when you get ullage on.
yes. i was just trying to see where my head was going to go.
"okay, 2 minutes bo seconds. i'm surprised that the sun is as far out on my left as it is."
"i am, too ...."
"you got the - you got the ems all set, huh? ... - -"
...
you bet. the ems is all set.
i can't hardly read it.
i know it.
i got it up full bright. we got that lower shield around anywhere?
"yes, we just put it away."
"well, forget it. hey, where are we now - where - where - exactly where are we?"
"... well, we're waiting for those lights to come on."
we're - we're waiting ...
... verb 24? we just passed australia.
"oh, ... i missed australia."
ail right. we got 1 minute - -
... not far enough ...

you don't start until you get ...
light off.
light off.
"lights are going to come on at 58 - hey, it's going to be interesting to see whose pulse peaked out the most on that one. man, i wouldn't - i wouldn't vote for mine at all. it probably hit 230 at - -"
mine - they're all that high.
mine - mine was probably right up there.
i'll bet it was because you looked up there ...
"oh, i couldn't believe that."
nobody even read them. they were so - -
"i said, ""al, they're all on."""
"(laughter) you know it's funny; all the simulating we've done, and they don't give us what we got up here."
they got to quit doing that (laughter).
"they didn't give us that, either. they didn't miss ... 00 02 37 17 l55 not my - wasn't our fault. it wasn't my fault they missed it."

... locked in. okay.
what did you do with the scissors?
put them in my tsb.
you had your hat on for the burn. probably ought to do that.

i saw that turtleback crater; it's right in here.
at 10 minutes; that's - we went by here at 25.
go get the tv camera.

what'd you see?
"(laughter) it's right-side-up in my window now; it looks fantastic. of course, we're getting higher sun angles - look at that!"
"yes. this ... sure enough it's leaking. 03 11 37 29 i24p everything's staying just like it was when we shut down, which is a swell idea, i think."
"boy, you'd never guess; it doesn't look like we're 60 miles, does it?"
"that's because everything is so much bigger; the craters are so much bigger - than anything you've ever seen, and i think that's why."
guess you're right.

"yes. you've got me all discobooberated, perspective-wise, now that we're in orbit. you feel the same way?"
"hey, who's that big guy?"
"we're going to have to learn which way on that map, whether we're going backwards or forwards - what we're doing. for example, we're right now at 25 - -"
we're right in at 25?
"... ph, 39; so it's 14 minutes. fourteen minutes - here's 20; we're right around in here. now - we're looking backwards. we ought to turn this map around the way we're going, see."
"hey, i see - i see the crater ..."
"here's the thing; you put our map around the way we're going - see, and out your side you ought to see a huge old one."
where?
right out there.
"i do - a monster - - 03 11 39 47 cml right here, there's about three or four right in the middle of - -"
"there's one that's got a whole bunch of craters in the bottom of it, where's ...? 03 11 39 52 civil that's this one - great big thing."
"no, it's not the same one."
"i'll tell you what; you could use this other map - it's a 1:1. it may be a better one. take a look at this one, dick. try this one for size. look at about - 15 minutes. the secret is to point the map down towards the leb."
is it firing?
yes.
why? 03 11 40 31 cml ... set to hold.
"man, it was firing. everybody complains, though."
... the firing - - 03 11 40 44 cml there's a huge monster with a central peak. look at that ! 03 11 40 48 i2_p/cdr where?
out my window; take a look.

"yes, but this - that's not a double crater. this is a double crater; this is the big crater - -"
"that one right there with the central peak in it, is that the one you're talking about?"
no. way out here! look at this - -
"oh - oh (laughter). goodness, you're right! wow!"
it's got a mare with it.
there it is. yes. look at that.
just go ahead and slide across.
"which one are you looking at, al?"
right there.
"oh, yes. isn't that pretty?"
"... hold this tv or sc_ething; i shouldn't have got it out, because i can take pictures."
i'll be waiting.
"we'll be back here again - - 03 11 41 46 cml what's the big hurry, bean-o?"
take pictures.
take pictures next rev.

here's your strap.
we're going to have acquisition here in about another 2 minutes.
we do; will check it on our high gain.
"boy, that does have mare in it, doesn't it?"
yes.
what did we end up percent on fuel? 03 11 42 14 i24p good god; 38.4 for fuel and 38.7 for oxidizer.
i hope we burned enough. did the ems say we did?
no - shut down early.

"oh, okay. i couldn't tell."
ems has 1.0.
ail right.
"unbelievable! just think, just the little bit- tiest ones down there we can see are going to be our crater. hey, there's one with collapsed sides over there. see it?"
where?

you can tell?

it's the white and black - it's -
i don't think - i don't want sunglasses.

"let me have - al, you want to start on the h2/o2 purge? and if you'll give me the tool - -"
i'll get it.
"- - tool e, i'll go start the water dump."
ail right. turn it off; i'm watching the waste right now.
turn off. potable - -
"now, i'll dump the potable - potable, too."
"dump a potable, closed."
hold on.
"whoo, man! is it dumping! whee!"
purge the fuel cells. 03 13 29 42 imp there's bound to be some somewhere - in the flight plan - ...
"look at that thing spray out of the side of the spacecraft; i never saw - look at that! that is propulsive, too."
you better believe it.
sure it is.
"gum, anyone?"
"yes, please."
i'm sure this book's from somewhere - probably up there.
how come you don't ...?
"you ought to ... some faster than that, you sleeping?"
...
your 02 purge?
huh? what 02 purge? 03 13 30 b1 cmp why did the flow go high?
...?
i ain't through.
huh?
it's not down there.
that's closed.

yes. _- day 4 page 101

cabin pressure's okay.
"can't give any reason for that .... are pretty shook up, too."
"well, why is it high right now? i know; water dump. i bet you."
you got to push it to oxygen to pressurize ...
"no, afterwards. prepare the ship for us."
"no, they say your ... - -"

you got to keep the ... in condition.

"boy, that thing is propulsive."
which way's it going - it's going out - -
right out that way; right out that way.
...
"it's radial - it's radial for that; it's perpen- dicular to the x-axis, but it's going out about 45 degrees here."
"here, dick."
...
"... can see it better from this window, dick. take a peak out of that there."
...
what's waste water?
h2 coming on.
okay.
through the supply valve.
"okay, yes."
knew there was something i hadn't done.
... when you get this shit in here.
it's hard to work in a ... with all that other stuff.
"have we picked up the moon, yet?"
no.
"i thought it was the moon ... possible ... radar. okay, h2 off."
fuel cell i has been purged - are you going to go for 2?
"yes, i think i'll go to 2 ..."
that's the first time i could notice chlorine in the water.
i never did.
i haven't either.
"boy, i can right .now - i can right now."
wonder why.
... little ... purge -
probably getting ahead of the chlorination.
yes.
like building up a chlorine content.
might - you get that one side -
you know it's over ...

...? 03 13 39 27 _ no. it's not ... now. he opened that last little vent like a bunny.
sure does.
potable open? potable's open?
".... that's never going to stay there, dick."
okay. another ...

"gosh, isn't that nice? oh, god damn, there it is - the moon!"
funny. · 03 13 41 18 lmp wait until you see it out of our window.
what'd you do? right there. music (freight train)
okay. goldstone 2 ...
number 3.
h2 master alarm.
"you really think that moon's all the same color, huh?"
"i don't know, but it looks it to me."
"no, there's some ... white - look at some - look at some of the slopes; see if they don't look a ... gray as the others do."
it looks a whole lot whiter over here. even in the shadow; look at that shadow down there. would you look in the shadowsl they're something'
there's some mighty healthy craters down there.
"wow, you ..."
very big - very big ones.
"christ, we're iow over here again."
"matter of fact, there we are, right? we're - no, we're not at our low point; we're exactly 180 de- grees from the - from the - the landing site."
"look at those mountains, dick. god d_mn! 03 13 43 39 cml yes."
58 - i wonder if that ... degrees is right in my loi ...
"wow, look at those mountains!"
look at that row of craters right there.
"yes, but that's not craters. you know what that is?"
those are vent tubes.
yes.
vent holes.
yes.
"hey, we ought to get a picture of that; i haven't seen anything like that before. 03 13 44 24 cml give me the camera - the camera."
"hey, what's the right setting here?"
what was our time? _ day 4 page 105
"what time were we supposed to do that? tell me what time it was, and i'll write it down up here"
"hurry up, pete, or i'll miss it."
okay. 180 degrees - 180-degree point at 85:31; 13 ... --
"give me the setting, al."
f:4.
"at what, 1/250th?"
"always, yes."
can you get that string of vent tubes - get all of that stuff if you can.
whatever happened to that - here it is.
"pete, if you'll write the time down over here for each rev, then we'll have it out and we won't have to look back. tell him to ... it here."
85:31:16. aos is 52 - 7 minutes. you still watch- ing the fuel cell purge?
yes. they're getting a little thicker here.
"we've got to get tei 5 block data, map update, and then that right there, dick, does it. p52. man, that's not bad! i never saw pictures like that from the moon."
they're all purged and they all look good. they're all balanced - -
"can you come up a little, al?"
can it pick them up any?
"i swear it's a different color over here, dick. i don't think the fact that you're looking at it this way - makes any difference."
it looks lighter to me. t
sure as hell does.
there's a lot of slumping in that crater.
"well, i had just decided ... when we were looking straight down, we were going so goddamned slow, i just figured we were going to fall into the moon."
"01d, you know that has got to be old, old, old, old!"
"it looks just like it was when it was made, too."
(singing)
"i ... physically, you'd really want to land on the back side. look at either that - either a crater or mountain sticking up; z don't know whether it's a crater or rim or what, right on the horizon."
"probably a crater rim, i would guess."
"what do you see down there, al?"
you look through this one - it looks like the optics are going like this. music (those were the days)
"damn, it's bright down there. give me a camera, al, and tell me the settings."
okay.
is it on the right settings?
i can't tell - there you go.
it's 250 millimeters. same settings?
"you can go to f:8 if you want; it was right on the borderline a while ago. 03 lb 51 41 cdr gee, but this is spectacular back here. i was photographing that new crater that's got a mountain in the middle of it. see it? 03 13 51 45 lm_ yes, i see. i don't know which one it is...."
"how's the tracking coming, dick?"
good.
good.
easy.
is it really?
yes.
is it easy to find the one you want?
that's the trick. that's the trick.
damn windows really make me mad.
isn't it the truth? sickening.
it's really sickening.
got aos.
"hello, hou - - time skip"
"actually, we're - it's kind of interesting. dick and a1 and i have really switched over to this time schedule, and we're quite happy on it. we - we're not really aware of the fact that it's the middle of the night back there."
"man, is that good cold water, now. whooo!"
that's the good kind. 03 15 15 37 cml how did it get cold?
"i just drank long enough to start getting it out of that tank. you know, emptied the line. it's cold now; isn't that cold?"
... p40.
"and we have not maneuvered, is that right? 03 15 16 23 cml we have."
we have?
wait a minute.
...
"how's the gas economy doing, dick? 03 15 16 35 omp i don't know. not too well, i'm afraid. i let this thing get away a couple of times from me."
"okay, we've got ullage on here. we haven't had ullage before. how many seconds?"
nineteen seconds.
"that's what's going to cost the gas, pal. did you pick b and d to do the ullage on? just two-jet, huh?"
yes.
we lost thetm - right on schedule. we get them back again at 88:01.
are those the high gains we use?
high gain - we should be at minus 71 and 206.
"88:01 - look at that! god, we're so much on the nominal flight plan, i can't believe it!"
keep it up.
"88:01, it has msfn acq, and that's spectacular! would you believe that?"
the burn was 4 seconds off. loi 1.
"yes, but that 4 seconds just made up for the whole - what was different in the trajectory; it put us back in the right place, i guess. that's phenomenal. _. day 4 _ page 109 03 15 18 33 cml where are we - 39 from the burn."
"how are we coming out? just like you said - at 1700 pounds on the helium, huh?"
"that was the big one. now it doesn't go down so fast. 03 15 19 09 cml i've got blowdown capability now, don't i?"
"oh, yes."
we have blowdown from what?
i think it was a fairly big number.
"they are putting us in a different orbit, though."
are they?
"well, they're putting - -"
... by 54 and we're showing about 65 by 53 - i mile.
(singing)
"da-da-da-dum, da-deedle-de-de. there's old cassiopeia."
"you got dse motion, al?"
yes.
all right. i just forgot to ask.
... hell out if ... do.
...
there's aldebaran. right straight ahead. 03 15 22 15 cml there you go.
menkar.
"man, look at the ... wow!"
"... i'm going to look out this window. this is by far the best window. 0h, there's orion."
"yes, right over here."
i can't figure out where rigel ...
there it is.
okay.
"what's this bright one down here, kind of to the right?"
mars. there's canopus.
i don't see canopus.
"it's over here. it's over on this corner, down south of orion .... there's one with a big - -"
"man, that docking target is bright."
"dick, let's see how bright it is,"
you could dock on that son of a bitch at night with no strain.
"i know those little - god dog, that thing's bright! those little things on the handrails are just that bright."
twenty-six minutes.
all right.
yes.
59 ...
"okay, you did the verb 49, and you have trimmed, huh?"
no.
huh?
i haven't trimmed in roll.
you haven't trimmed in roll. okay.
we've done the sextant star check. let's take her down to 8 minutes. - day 4 page i!
let me check my circuit breakers first.
okay.
"yes, this is much better."
where's the flight plan?
right there. what do you need?
"ail right, give me the trim ... firing."
oh.
... plus - 1 foot.
"trim x to 1 foot. otherwise, you just take what you get."
i don't see any trim needed. not the way this beauty's performing.
"gee, i hope the _ performs this well."
"you know, they made a gross tactical error; they should have rigged the lm up so the csm power could power the imu. and you could bring the imu up enroute and align the goddarn thing, you know, maybe get a good drift check on it and all that crap."
"okay, all my circuit breakers and everything look good."
do you always take the radio with you and cut the rest of us out?
yes. the_rest of us would like to hear it a little bit.
you don't like this son_ (laughter). it's an a1 bean song.
we'll let you listen to - whatever the cat's name is.
got to watch the end of it; got to rewind; we ought to shut down. you want to shut down?
can't we hear your song?
"that'_the end of it. w wmw, l"
"we can't hear your song, huh?"
"you want to hear it? let's hear it again, huh? (laughter) you don't like it, i know (laughter). it's got to be loud to be enjoyed."
let's hear your song.

"yes, i think we've got everything in order."
"if they put this in - if they made up a hollywood movie, just like this, you wouldn't believe ... - -"
what do you mean?
listening to this music on the back side of the moon.
that's right (laughter).
what's the matter - -
... that's so flashy and ... - - 03 15 28 24 cml - - you got something against music?
"no, i'm just saying that - -"
"nobody would buy it. this is corny, cornball; you've got to be hard out there."
"say, the biggest thing i missed on gemini v was not having any music; every once in a while, they'd pipe some up over hf, but - our old nickel-dime tape recorder there, i'd have given my right arm for it."
what's the burn time?
burn time is 17 seconds - -
"what ... we going to come on with it - - 03 15 29 02 cmzp that's interesting. it says burn time plus 1 second. and if the engine performs like it did the last time, it's going to shut down about - on time. that's too sh, burn not for us to n_ _ice it."
they've probably got a handle on it.
"they may have, yes. hey, you know we've an awful hot engine. and that very - you know, we may get - if this engine stays like this, we very well may get 24 hours knocked off our translunar coast - -"
"oh, that would be nice."
"oh, i'm sure it will."
that had to be an extra hot engine to save the propellant to do it. 1
"yes, why don't you rewind it right now; then we're in good shape."
"okay. after the burn's over, we can have a little more music."
"i like the kind of ship you run, ...... happy."
(laughter)
keep the sailors happy - give them exactly what they want.
we sure have.
(laughter)
i'll be glad when you shave that fu manchu ... off your face (laughter).
yes. that's terrible.
"doesn't it look good? i might keep it, now that i hear that comment."
you wouldn't like it if you saw yourself. go look at yourself.
it's too iow; it needs to be shorter.
"if it's that repulsive, i ought to wear it."
"pete, there isn't enough there to even see it."
that's right.
"god, i hate to shave! oh! it's going _o hurt."
no.
"it'll feel good - - 03 15 30 56 cml yes, you're right."
take a bath.
"yes, hey, i'm going to - -"

"tonight the night? 03 15-31 02 lmp. tonight's the night. 03 15 31 03 cml ... it down with hot water. 03 15 31 05 i_mp take a bath, shave, get all cleaned up, good night's sleep - -"
(singing)
"you got anything else to do tomorrow? all right, that's what we'll do then. we'll go for a little lunar landing, how's that? unless you got something better in mind - a little surfing at the beach, or something."
"hell, yes. 03 15 31 26 cml how about the backside sand? go play in the sand on the back side."
(laughter) yes. let's take the lm down and land on the back side. wouldn't that shake them up? (laughter)
we could do our old doi burn an hour later. we saw something on the back side that mas a little more interesting than the front side.
look at that! the glycol pump's back down again.
"yes, that baby really cycles it."
"so far, dick, i imagine we haven't stabilized yet. it's got up to 55."
what time is it? how much time we got for the burn?
seventeen minutes.
okay.
"play that music just before reentry, and get us in the proper frame of mind. we could get it out and play it coming down in the chutes."
wouldn't that be cool?
"yes, we're here, houston, listening to a little music as we come down in the chutes. everything in chickieboo - where's the ship? (laughter) we could drive them crazy with that stuff."
we ought to get -
(singing)
(singing)
fifteen minutes.
"boy, that would just put the frost on the cake, you know that?"
"what, a 24-hour return?"
"yes, knock 24 hours off the return. boy, - -"
just think of that.
how much more delta-v do we need to do it?
a thousand - - '
"we got enough right now - we got enough right now, but we didn't have the reserves for midcourse. we were within, say, 1 percent of running it out of gas. so - -"
"we're not ... on the sps for the midcourse anyway, are we? _-_ day 4 _'_ page 117 03 15 35 12 imp we might - -"
"i think for some disperse cases, they got to - _ don't know what the reason is, but i can tell you out 3f my ... because it said we had to have a - it said __ had enough to do it right now, but we had zero reserves for midcourse. and it said - you know, if we had a particularly good engine, they _uldn't plan on it. and it said - you know, nobody usually has that good an engine. it sounds like this engine's pretty good - most engines have been overburning, you know."
"historically, here, we can shut down 6 seconds early. that baby had to really flat be honking."
"you know, our gdc seems to - did you just align that thing or something? 03 15'36 10 cmp not too bad when you're standing still. 03 15 36 13 i24p yes, i wonder what the rotation is?"
"well, i guess ..."
i don't understand.
"give me the water gun, pete, if you got any - a ' few moments, while we're talking about things. i could go for another grink."
"that food - you eat a lot of that food, and even though you put water in it, it's still - still dry."
it's still dry. (singing)
about 30 degrees ...
"yes, any minute."

... about half ... - -
i'll tell you another thing it is; it's the thrusters firing - - 03 15 37 41 t_mp how many - how many - -

"you know you got about - 11 minutes, al."
okay.
"you do want to shave between now and then? 03 15 38 05 _ yes, i guess. maybe you ought to - take a couple of pictures."
"yes, how about changing attitude here for a minute? there's a couple of good shots right underneath us."
i've got a feeling we'll be in ... attitude in ...
watch the whole setup. don't want you to be scrambling at the last minute.
that's right. you always want to stay way ahead; i hope i can do that tomorrow. i'll find out. i don't see why not. we'll be spring-loaded to a think-ahead condition.
maybe he's right.
you set the dap?
"it's all done. the dap's set; we're standing by waiting for 8 minutes, and that'll be along in a minute and a half .... and a half. a minute and a half. 03 15 40 11 _ say, you going to have tv on your window in the - when we separate tomorrow?"

you'll know when we get there.
"do you read me, houston?"
"... the ascent stage from the handover. what do you want, al?"

"hello, houston; apollo 12."
"no one in there to - shit, feels like there's nothing in there."

"what omni would that be, dick? b? don't touch - don't touch these."
"try ..., try ..."
"yes. okay, houston, i'm on omni b. how's that?"
...
"okay, what - what the problem is, is i - for some reason, it's making me break out. it looks like i've got poison ivy under those things and they are weeping - plasma, or whatever you weep; and the one i moved is the one on the top of my chest, and that's all broken out up there. now, i don't want to take the rest of them off because i'm afraid of what i'm going to find underneath. so what i propose to do is continue the way they are and when we get done the evas down there, i want to get rid of them; they're driving me buggy."
"roger. okay, i've already moved that one, and - m_ skin's in pretty bad shape underneath it. it's still weeping whatever you weep, plasma, i guess; and i don't want to move the other ones."

that's affirmative.

"go ahead and put them in that - put them in that waste bag. those babies go to the lunar surface, as far as i'm concerned."
that's where i've been putting mine.
in the lm? _ day 5 page 185
"nobody said anything to me about used towels, though. i'll just say, ""what? no, i didn't - nobody said anything about that."" 04 05 25 2_ lmp doesn't sound too bad anyway - -"
okay .... towels - dirty ones.
... keep a clean towel.
got rid of them.
the dirty one going into the lmp's clean - (laughter)
"you ought to really smoke this baby over from one end to the other, when we get - the food's no problem, but anything else is, you know, get rid of it. like you say, if we could get rid of those turds, we'd have it made."
"day 5, meal a."
"okay, that's done, baby. don lcg at 102:30. i think i'll start that about 102."
huh? where - where are you?
... at me.
coming at you. right here.
"let me see if i - don lcg. well, i can don it here; i got ... time. i don't get in - and the thing of it is, i got to be out of the way when you're donning yours."
"look, i'll help you get into your whole rig and then you press on."
okay.
"hey, how soon do you fire up the batteries in that bastard; right away though, don't you?"
we got to do that on time.
"lm power, 104."
straight ahead for 3 hours and 40 minutes from here. o4 o5 27 0o cmp ...?
yes.
"hey, would you stick - would you stick - that in the waste disposal unit, over there?"
get her in the ...
we got aspirin over in that other son of a bitch?
yes.
"okay. as long as we got aspirin, that's all i wanted to know. i have a feeling that i may need it, over there - getting tired."
got your ... for you.
oh.
"that thing's in a separate bin from anything else. here, let me just snap it on something, or - -"
why don't you snap it right there? that's where i figured it'd go.
"mine's in my helmet bag, so i didn't have to worry about it."
going to have some music to cool it. i'm about as jumpy as i can be this morning.
you noticed!
huh? jumpier than i was on launch day.
i kind of have the same feeling; it's a bigger day. _-- day 5 page 187
"it is. you've got more things under your con,hand today, ... launch day, you're just - kind of along for the ride. be safe; stickwith that freaking list - ... stick to the list and be careful you don't throw the wrong switch. don't get in a hurry."
don't get too fancy.
no fancy shit; you're right.
d_mnx do i have a lot of breakfast here ....
see how my pulse is doing.
"let me have the gun, richard, if you're done with it."
"i'm slow, pete."
it's a minute above normal.
what's 'normal?
seventeen - in a 15-second period. that's what i've been running; i've been checking myself. i used to multiply it out and then i said to hell with it.
roger. we've got a 15-second turnover.
shit.
what happened? 04 05 31 07 _ nothing.
it isn't easy. watch what you're doing.
"you haven't rewound it. boy, i tell you; this shit drives me totally insane."
parts falling off of our spacecraft like - loose ...
"god damn, damnl i'll tell you; i hate these mother-freakers with a passionl god drmnx oh, shitl"
what happened?
"oh, i just let the parts loose_ it makes me sloppy and i hate to be sloppy in spacel right?"
right - -
got to be neat l
"- - if you say so. we have got a pretty neat spaceship. the only bag of worms we're leaving dick gordon will be that big bag of - stuff here. fortunately, most of this food is - done."
dick can handle it.
"dick's a little jumpy this morning, too; i've been watching him in action. i can tell by your arm movement."
"there you go - up, up. somebody's - gotten to that little ..."
"i tell you, i hate to see that thing ... 0h 05 33 16 cdr i really do get annoyed at those end pieces though; they just drive me absolutely ape! now, for your next one, did you want to shake the bag? look at that. is that a drop of water on the end of that bastard?"
(hnmrnlng)
it'll be goodto get down on the lunar surface and do some physical work. you know that?
speak for yourself; i'm a lazy son of a bitch.
"so am i, but ... - i'm just ready enough to get down there and -"
you can't hardly sock it up (laughter).
too soft?
"yes, and it's ... like everything. hey, we got to decide what we going to do with that plaque."
... put it up ... going to put it up and the other one steps back and reads ...
you're going to put it up; how am i going to know when you're finished?
i'll tell you.
"that looks pretty good or something like that? 04 05 34 29 ia_ yes. okay, then you step back, and i'll step right beside you."
okay·
and then i'll go out and grab that thing some way so the tv camera can see it.
yes.
and you move it around so they can see the side view of it - -
"well, what i really ought to do is, you ought to put the tv camera on the - where you're going to drive the pole in, and i ought to stand off the tv - and get it all raised; you can walk in and ·.. it all."
not a bad idea.
yes. that's what we'll do.
"i'll put in the pole, and i'll step back, so that - -"
yes.
"- - so that - here's the tv; here's the flag - i'll step back here, and you can put it - step over here, then you go around, and we salute it...."
i don't think it's ...
like that?
"yes, r'll like that."
...
(laughter) here it is.
"you can just read it off your cuff, man."
"here it is. oh, it's an ugly m0ther."
it sure is.
"(singing) 0o-oo-oo. 0o-oo-oo, yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah yeah"
...
this is coal black.
"hey, what did i do with my bacon?"
"i have one of them,"
what happened to my bacon? i guess it got away.
whoops (laughter)
"here you are, dick. thank you."
"you can have some of mine, ..."
"i just hope we find the old snowmanl then, i hope we find a place to land; then, i hope i can set it down all right!"
"if you can set it down, you'll find a place to land. don't you comment too long."
don't let it get low.
don't let us get iow. that worries me more than anything. i think we'll see the crater; i just hope we - hope we - -
"i copy about 5 degrees' sun angle, right there, don't i? right back there's going to be about 5 degrees r sun angle. god damn, it's going to stand out. those shadows are going to be sharp as hell. _- day 5 page 191"
"they are - a lot more sharper than the simulator, aren't they?"
"we could ... wherever that is, you know."
"the trouble is, there's a lot of other ... - yes, i think you're going to find it. don't - don_t de that. you're liable to get amongst them, again. that worries me a little bit."
we'll probably be better off targeted right to the crater.
huh?
probably better off targeted right to the crater.
that's right.
"if we got any error, we're going to be long, any- how."
"if it's good and low, we can really burn it up and just float along."
"you know, we've got one hell of an inclination to the sun; will you look at that - inclination angle of those shadows?"
yes. beautiful. going to make it nice to see in.
i hope so. i wish i could see what i'm - we're 60 miles; how big do you suppose those craters are down there? how many meters across the goddamn thing? it must be kilometers.
"well, we ought to be able to see ours, just past this ... let's see, our sun time ..."
"if we pull this off, we could be slicker than owlshit."
"it's driving me buggy; i just don't know what i'm going to see when i pitch over. take a look and i'm going to say, ""ahhhhhhhx there it is!"" i'm going to say, ""oh, freeze it!"" i don't recognize nothing (laughter). then, i'm in deep yogurt. then, if i dgn't_recognize anything, i'm just going to let it keep going. that's the best i can do."
that's right.
if you don't recognize a thing_ i'll look - just tell me - i'll look out my side- -
"yes, yes."
"- - and you look at the computer for a few seconds, and let me see if i see anything out there. what altitude now? 60 miles and it's pretty damn high. and you'll ..."
that's that - that's that crater vent tube.
isn't that fantastic!
"hey, and that's going to be in the dark - not too long after -"
that's ridiculous; how'd we ever get here anyway?
(laughter)
why would a guy want to put his ass on the line like this?
(laughter)
bet you those prunes are going to lay in my stomach like a rock.
"god da=n - d_mn! i hate you, water bag! look at that!"
"that's a deep crater, that great big one there."
"oh, yes."
"the one that's a hole, with all that tucked in."
yes. yes.
"you know, i think that's something that the scientists just didn't really realize at all is _ day 5 page 193 that the moon has been relatively untouched for billions of years."
look at that fantastic freaker right here. 04 05 43 i8 cmp ... must have been like - -
wow!
"- - to be around here. one of the interesting places is over there - i wish i had taken some pictures - where all the craters were kind of - look like where you shoot balls into mud, you know - -"
"yes, yes."
"- - they made angles, but they didn't - they never b"
"yes, sir. anything like that - -"
- - they didn't look - nothing - looked real weird.
"they got the idea, just like you said, that that stuff caved in while it was still molten."
do you have a wet pack in the lm?
for dinner?
yes.
... do we got one before we go out tomorrow?
no. you can only have one wet pack; i don't know. i don't remember.
ail you - -
"yes, you got one."
good grief ...!
"oh, just got a vent tube."
al? right down in here. j
yes.
yes. they got to be - they got to be volcanic. but look how crude this got.
"yes. that stone is, like you say, billions and billions of years. hey, are we maneuvering?"
what?
"funny, sort of looked like we were."
120 degrees roll.
"okay. man, that's strange. must have been just the way the crater was."
"we've got quite an inclination to the front, don't we?"
now. look at these little tiny vent tubes; that's what they got to be down there. they make them look like - -
"yes. i see, the little dots? 04 05 _5 24 cmp yes, and it makes them look like -"
they're birds that run across the sand?
yes.
"... that down there's got ..., that's got to be volcanic."
how small a crater can you resolve with your eyes from 60 miles?
"i don't know. we figured it out one day, but i don't know what it is. i think we should be able to see - our - our landing site. recognize the snowman. gordon can give us his ... pa."
how about another bacon? and we'll eat this canadian bacon and leave one of these kind.
"... getting houston, now. got 6 minutes, though, huh? we'll be on the horn; yak, yak, yak. _-_ day 5 page 195"
how about pads? do you need your pa_s?
let me look. i got to copy a consumables update - -
no sweat.
"- - update to csm - ti and t2 times for fra mauro photographs. update to csm; tei 34 pad, map update rev 11, csm dap pad, comm attitude, and high gain. uplink to csm; state vector, verb 66 - -"
"you got to ... that pad over there, dick."
should have caught on at about a - about 45 minutes.
got the pad over with you? because i don't see it over here with me.
where in the hell did it go?
okay.
"another p30 pad, isn't it?"
going to run the outload.
"what do we do, pdi 127"
eleven.
"no, there's pdi 11, right there."
"now, i don't know."
"wait in line, group. out in the tunnel maybe. i put one of them up there last night."
49 - -
"there they are, d_mu it. just in time."
"hello, houston; 12. read you loud and clear. how me? time skip"
- - left behind. 04 07 o0 43 _ ...
"don't worry about it; you're in good shape. here. no, here. easy."
"here, right here."
"apollo 12, houston. one minute from los, and things are all looking good now, we'll see you at 103:47. over."
roger; 103:47.
"okay. the freaking lm's powered up. all right, al; you're in good shape. 04 0701 12 lmp that did it, that one right there."
yes.
"put the ... in there, pete."
right.
"now, ... well, there's nothing we can do. that hard stuff doesn't want to come out of there, pete."
"yes, that's dried up, ..."
sure did.
get that?
got it.
tried this one?
okay.
put it down.
...
... to 1....
"okay. we'll just pull up ... _- day 5 :i""_ page 197"
"did you find it, dick gordon, or did i really screw you up? you find that strap? where was it? 04 07 03 58 cml ... 04 07 04 0t cdr you can help zip it up, dicky-dick."
okay.
where'd this come from?
huh?
"that ... - what number is it? 04 07 04 2t cdr it's 9, ..."
it's a dead one. right? it's a used one.
"it's a used one but, i mean - -"
throw it in the disposal thing.
"well, let's see how that one looks. looks okay to me. get in there and get this lm going."
"don't worry; you've got plenty of time, al. you're going to be so freaking far ahead of the game, it's pathetic."
"well, i want to take - -"
"let me have it and i'll stow it. okay, just a minute, i'll have music and i'll stow it (laughter). do things right. a little music never hurt anybody. get that up out of the way, just like that. i need to get under this top bag, right here."
"now, ... this freaking suit."
"just a minute; let's get dick squared away. 04 0705 27 cdr that's where these came out of, wasn't it? right there. just a second; i got to get this tidied up here. just stowing your hose and thing."
going off the comm.

this here thing has got to go in the - put that in the disposal.
"all right, just i minute, dicky-dicky. are you ready."
there you go.
...
sir?
i'll go ahead and do it with my hat on.
"now, what you need to do is to get in the couch; that's right. and i'll hook you up red to blue and blue to red. all right. now, how do they tape these things, all the way around this way? which way do you want these? huh? do you want them ... ? no-"
just like this?
...
okay. we could take that strut out of here now.
...
okay. and ... all these goodies. and i'll help you with your snap. meanwhile -

"okay, that's about - about 35 minutes from now."
go - go ahead and ...
"you got a good bag over there - drop that in your waste stowage hag, dick."
temporary stowage bag?
"okay. stick that in your tsb. now, i'm going to rig my suit, al, if you'll hand me those two things by your map - -"
...
"- - right down here. what do you need in here? well, if you'll wait about 3 seconds, dick, we'll be able to do it and be ahead of schedule. okay?"
"al, want me to close your tsb for you?"
"well, let me out. god d_mn, i was wondering why i was getting wet; there's water under the bulkhead on the - underneath the lc bag. that's where that moisture's been collecting."
"keep going ... freaking hell ... god d_=_! oh, man, that's bad news! that ... is bad news. my suit is sopping wet all over the legs; that hulk- head has leaked right through that lc bag."
...
huh?
...
i hope so. i haven't explored around far enough to find out. it's all down the back of the legs. that damn ... after we leave on the ...
...
...
"well, damn, we've got to; it won't fire up the ecs for a while."
...
"get what? all right, tell you what. right there by the center hatch is my sunglasses - and the helmet bag is up there to the right side of my pencil."
"sunglasses are in the helmet, right there. i don't want the helmet. that's all right."
... sunglasses?
"i need the sunglasses, a flashlight, and a pen. o4 o7 25 58 cmp ..."
right by the pencil.
...
it was up there a while ago.
"let's go ahead and take the hatch out; you can stay put. let me see now, where i can ... no, better put it under ai's couch. al? you put your hoses ... where they ..."
dick? i'm going to let a1 get out of here before i suit up.
"how do you hear, dick gordon? 04 07 27 32 cml ... loud and clear."
okay. got a bunch of shit floating around here; i never saw anything like it.
"whose helmet's this, dick's?"
"mine, i guess. damn."
something else we'd better cheek - in just a minute. boots and ...
"okay, that's okay. that's good. a hat, get this tsb; look at that son of a gun go."
here.
get it out of your way.
one hatch ...
"here's the monocular. okay, bean, let's see if you got it."
"hey, pete, why don't i go ahead and do that? i know where the hell these things go and everything."
iv gloves.
okay. ail yours. i just figured we'd get them out of here without - -
"yes. yes, i'd just as soon go ahead and get the shit done."
- - ... i'll get out of your way.
"the other way. i better get in the center couch - it's going to be tough - well, i guess you can stick it under my feet. well, we'll just do what you can. better shut this map."
rendezvous abort book and lm data. we got that data?
god damn it!
"my time line book. i can move if you need me to, dick. 04 07 28 56 cml no, sorry. it's just these hoses are so bad. how about putting that down somewhere?"
sure.
...
everybody's doing a good job; they're holding their temper.
... i can't believe it.
that's where we want to be. set over there and think how - -
"turn on tunnel lights, please."
"tunnel lights, coming on."
"103:54, it says i'm supposed to get there. what time is it now?"
"wait, now wait; don't let my bag go anywhere. okay, i got you. i'm going to - god damn these freaking hoses!"
"can i help you some way, dick?"
"yes, just get the goddamn hoses out of my way."
"okay. we can get in there now, if you - how's that, babe? we're just screwing around over here, babe."
got a lot of time.
"we're way ahead. i'm not even due in until 53 and that's 23, 24 minutes from now. you're not kidding. i just won't turn on the bat. get all the other stuff done."
"hey, another one - hey there; look, grab that freaking clip."
clip.
"grab a bunch of trash; that stuff should never been hauled out. it causes more crap. if we didn't have those things, we wouldn't have as much crap outside floating around."
"(laughter) doesn't sould like the pete conrad i know; it's usually (laughter) - it's usually, ""out of my way, gang, we've got to get going."" (laughter) why didn't you just - -"
"... do it right, gang, ... cards are floating around; ... time, and it'll save us time."
you son of a bitch!
... get that in there early -
"yes, lift it up and let me get this in here and then we can - there you go - i'll shoot this in here."
snap one snap back here. that'll keep your's in place. that's good. snap this one over here - get this one in place. there goes the thruster fire -
"yes, we're moving around."
"where can i put this? now, i'll tell you what i need. when did i take that last pill? i'm going · to make sure i don't get my ears stopped up."
"here, ..."
anybody want any gum?
"we - when we get in, we want to cheek over all those damn - books, make sure we got them. oh, i put them all in my mouth, pete; sorry. wasn't thinking."
"we're not supposed to be charging any bat, are we?"
"yes, i thought we were already charging this bat."
"no. we talked about it last night, but we never called it out this morning - -"
i thought he told us to start charging it.
"he may have and, if he did, i sure as hell didn't hear him and didn't do it."
ail right .... got comm ... hooked up.
"yes. i got comm, but -"
"hey, dick?"
"al, just pull those hoses around like this. that's the boy; that'll do it. all it does is block that whole freaking area,"
didn't know i was doing it.
"well, you probably weren't; they probably just went that way."
if i can get out of here whenever these - -
"pete, wait a minute - raise your seat."
this way?
yes. that's a boy. thank you.
"doesn't say to in the plan. hey, dick gordon? now, where the hell did that strap go? there it is."
yes.
did they tell us to charge a bat this morning?
i don't think so.
okay.
is it in the flight plan?
no.
"we talked about it last night, but i never heard any; i could - of course, i could have been off the comm."
"somewhere along here, we want to go off lm .... right?"
off what?
we're on lm press. we got to go hack to something else.
"well, we go to off here, shortly, i guess."
"probably kicking the hell out of you down there,"
"god damn this freaking ...! boy, this ... up on everything."
"sure does, that net."
... set the clock.
"hey, pete."
yes.
"if you'll hold this, and dick gordon will hand me that t - hey, i - i'll rig that tv for you. if you want me to, do what you want. it's in there."
... - -
guess where that goddamn thing is?
"underneath the probe. i'll go get it. hey, dick? i don't have a suit on - -"
let pete get it; he doesn't have a suit on or anything else.
- - we have all the freaking time in the world.
let me get my ass over in the lm - stand around over there.
"get that - ready to go and i'll rig - dick, get me that - i'll rig it for tv."
okay.
the thing to do is get rid of these goddamn things - -
"boy, i'll tell you, that's a pain in the ass; everyone of those bastards are."
- - i had three freaking little clips and - take those - -
"wait, the map's stuck."
"well, i need to go over there and i can't."
"no, you need to go that way. that's exactly the way you need to go."
you got to go that way.
you'll never get out of here unless you do.
i know it but - see this - -
i'll get you out of here.
i lowered this a little bit - is that okay?
got it made.
just a second; i want to miss all these circuit breakers. they're okay.
put your feet up; just go right up in the tunnel.
"put your feet up, al."
okay.
...
wait a minute; just a second. my shoulders are wider than the distance between - there. wait a second.
you're all right.
you're okay; got plenty of room.
"okay, now, do me a favor as you send me through. you're going to have to hand me my helmet bag and the tsb and - -"
here's the ... bag.
okay.
"your helmet bag is right here. now, do you want this helmet bag? or do you want to leave the bag back - -"
"no, i'm going to send the bag back to you."
"ail right, here."
"now, here's what i'd like to have you do, if you would."
yes.
"as i slowly go up here, how about snapping a few of those things in?"
i will.
okay.
"here's your helmet bag, and i'll feed the hoses ...."
"wait, wait, wait - okay."
let me run it down; give you a little more - slack --
...
just a second. we're way ahead.
"yes, let's stay that way. move."
"you are in, ..."
okay.
you might have to do a 360 down there and unwind this hose.
"okay. now, it doesn't seem to bother me, right this minute. i'll try one this way. okay."
that looks good. looks real good_ al. 04 07 40 15 cml okay. i'll go get the tv.
don't you want to get back in your couch ...
"no, i better get the hell out of the way."
"i'll tell you one thing, ...... i can't believe it."
"have it coming off there in just a minute, anyway. i'll put the interconnects on."
"now, i've got to go over here and ... we got to move this whole thing to get it."
"yes, i know it. shit, that pissed me off! i talked about it before. wait a minute, let me - hold it right there. can you get this stuff out of there you need?"
... cables and monitor. i'll get the ...
is anything flowing through my hose?
is your what?
put my hose on suit flow.
how's that?
"there you go, good show."
"... leave that ... right where it is. now, where's the tv now, ..."
where is it?
right up under my ass ...
put that back in there.
"hey, dick? ..."
"wait a minute, pete. take this off my hands and i'll get it out for you. they've rigged this crap so it'll be up."
...
pete?
yes?
"here comes something, just -"
what?
"i - i'll call you in a minute. i'm just going to throw one of the helmet stowage bags back, including my tsb; no hurry."
"gee, i'll tell you where the tv mount is."
never mind; we got it.
"by the tape. now, let me tell you the best way to do it."
is that all set up for the window?
"no, but if you hand it here, i'll set it real quick, and it'll save explaining it."
"now, which way are we doing it? 04 07'42 56 lmp put orange to orange on both. see, now, that one clamp has a little orange-to-orange dot and then the circular has an orange-to-orange dot. the best thing to do is take it over by the window because, otherwise, you'll never guess it in a million years. stick this thine in the hole and you've got - -"
what are you doing to ... here?
"what? i - i can't remember it either. let me do the orange one, though. i'll rig this and you just go over - i don't know whether it sits on ... this one or the side one, i never can remember, but i'll fix this where it works. okay, that goes there and this color tv one goes - orange to orange. now, that should be pretty close; but, when you stick it over there, you may find out it needs to be on that bracket. i'm not for sure which. okay? and take this with you and put it right by - in the tsb. good."
did you want this tv - a lower one? 04 07 44 i9 lmp it's got tv mount on it.
"oh, yes; i see it. _%_"
"these windows are all fogged up; when we - when we come on with power, we're going to have to come on with the window heaters."
...
the middle one. it says tv right on it. that's it.
"i think this ought to be f:22 ... 04 07 45 12 _ ... guys are too much. oh, that makes me mad."
"what's the matter, al?"
"we complained about this damn bag one time and they claimed they fixed it. they sure as hell didn't. easy, pete."
i'm just going to shove it straight in; you're just not shoving it in all the way.
i know. it won't go all the way. there it goes ....
that looks okay.
... everything ....
let me have your monitor ...
where in hell is my helmet?
"i put it behind my seat, dick."
okay.
...
"hey, al?"
"yes, sir."
that tv kind of interferes with the ...
it sure does; it just barely doesn't when it's rigged right. it just barely misses it.
"we'll need it rigged right; that's for sure .... nov, but it doesn't lo me."
"well, loosen it up some then, and move it over just a tad. loosen up on the ball. that one right there. you've got to be kidding on this rig. come out any further? hell, that's good enough anyway, isn't it?"
... tsb.
huh?
...
uh-oh.
what?
"son of a gun - no, it's not the lm. hey, look in that med kit and bring me a whole cellophane roll of those decongestants; they don't have any in here. they got everything but that."
i'll get it in a minute.
"okay, just so we don't forget it. pain in the ass, huh?"
"no, it's not - ... 04 07 48 37 cml ..."
bring this down ...
mcdivitt's purse is enough to make - - time skip
"understand, houston. the lmp, of course, is back in, and we're going to press with everything that doesn't need msfn."
"roger. so long, clipper."
"roger, houston."
"okay, yankee clipper; intrepid. we're going to start giving you data now."
okay. i'm ready to record.
"yankee clipper, intrepid. are you catching my b-data now?"
"that - that's affirmative, al."
thank you.
"hey, pete, i've preioaded this - this - probe now. can you take another quick check at the docking latches?"
roger. hatch all locked up.
"okay, pal. i've put my helmet and gloves on and cocked all the latches for you. okay."
"oh, shoot!"
that's better.
"how're you doing over there, yankee?"
"i'm just getting bused up, pete. 04 09 04 50 _cdr okay. give me a holler when you're all bused up; i'm going to step ahead on a few items."
"are you in attitude hold? 04 09 05 20 cml hey, pete."
"hey, dick, are you holding attitude? you are; aren't you?"
"yes, but i've got to turn the roll jets to - to off until i get the capture latches. got to get the latches and get the hatch in and bleed the tunnel down. i can't maneuver yet. you're just going to have to wait on me."
"yankee clipper, intrepid."
"go ahead, pete."
what you doing?
putting the hatch in right now.
"oh, okay. i'm going to pressurize my rcs; you may hear it."
"okay, pete. i'm depressurizing the tunnel."
okay.
"it's going to take a while and, as soon as we get it down to 3,5, i'll have a couple of jets on, so we really haven't rolled very far."
okay.
that's kind of work with this suit on.
i'll bet it was.
"okay, pete. i've got the tunnel down a little bit. how's your cabin look?"
"it's holding real good, dick."
okay. i'm going to go ahead and bleed it down the rest of the way.
let her go.
...
"gad, i hope i can land."
"say, yankee, what's the tunnel down to?"
okay. i'm down to 3 pounds - differential.
"going to let her keep going, huh? 04 09 21 41 cml yes, sir. keep it going."
okey-dokey. but are your roll jets back on?
"well, i'll have two of them back on at 3.5, pete."
okay.
"hey, pete?"
go ahead.
t see three of your landing gear pads are deployed. i can see three of them.
okay. what's the tunnel now?
let me look. it should be down where we can get some jets on here.
"okay - okay, pete. it's down to about 3.8; i can turn two roll jets on."
okay. how do you know when it gets to zero?
"as it gets above 4, i can turn four of them on."
okay.
so it'll be okay. then we're right back at the same attitude.
"okay, dick. and as soon as we get these guys a0s here - i've got the fine torquing angles in, so what we want to give them is an 06, 20."
okay.
"say, did you see those two craters we just flew over, dick? 04 09 36 34 cml negative."
"man, that's a mighty impressive territory down there; i'll tell you that."
"oh, that - the big ones right behind us. you're talking about the big one, right down at your footpad right now."
yes.
yes. i see that.
"i - i - i keep estimating that if i was flying over the desert, i'd be about, at the most, 20 to 30 000 feet."
that's what i keep thinking. why is that?
sixty miles up.
that's what i keep thinking. i wonder how come?
i can't believe you're at 60 miles.
i can't either. i hope i can get myself oriented when we get down lower.
okay. the only thing i'll remind you of on this one; i got to get my tracking attitude at 5 by 106:10. i think we can do that.
"yes. i'm going to honk when wy get here, dick. i'm way ahead on several things, and i think we can beat the rap here pretty good. what time's aos?"
forty-five.
"okay. right about 46, let's grab a quick 06 noun 20."
"things are looking awful good over here, pete."
"look good here, too, dick."
"did you check out your tv yet, dick?"
"no, i haven't. but i might."
... over.
"hello, houston; clipper here."
"roger, clipper. give us p00 and accept - - time skip"
"okay, any time, pete."
"okay, on my mark. 4, 3, 2, 1 -"
mark.
"houston, ri reads plus three balls 44; r2, plus 26956; r3, plus 00054. over."
_..
"okay, houston. plus 29928, plus 08952, plus 35934; the time, 106:15:55."
"roger. at 106:15:55, ... plus 26956, ..."
that's a charlie.
and that get was 106:15:55. affirmative?
"that's affirm. okay, houston. you've been keeping tabs on us; make sure i got this right. it seems to me we're complete through 107 hours, or at 46. we're standing by to pick up with a rendezvous radar self-test and ags cal. do you see anything before that we haven't done?"
"give us a secondto review, pete. we think you're okay."
"okay, smoke her over. i don't want to leave anything out."
"intrepid , houston."
"go, houston."
"okay. we're up with you, pete. you're at 107."
"okay, i think that's going to work real good, then, because, while dick's not firing any thrusters for ags cal, we'll get the rendezvous radar self-test out of the way."
roger.
"let me know when you're going to start tracking, yankee."
"okay, pete. i've got 66 degrees' trunnion yet for rev align along with it; and it's got to come down to 22 before i'll pitch over."
"okay, you know where you are?"
"sure, i'm smoking over the scenery out in front ofs e."
"that's good. okay, let me know if you see the snowman when you go by."
okay.
"houston, intrepid. we forgot to give you our rcs helium pressure."
"no, i gave - -"
it's about 2950.
"roger, al. thanks."
it's okay. the lmp was outside when i gave it to you.
he wasn't either; he was over here seeing what he forgot.
"houston, clipper."
"_ clipper, houston. go."
i was just looking over the electrical system. do we have a battery a charge scheduled this afternoon?
that's negative ....
"well, you going to make that sps burn? that battery a is down quite a bit."
...
we may have missed one along the way; i'm not sure.
"hey, pete. we're getting close."
"okay, dick. do your usual good job."
i'll do my best.
i know that.
damn that thing.
"how you doing, clip? 04 10 27 08 cml okay, pete. it's 106:30. i'll be starting to pitch over, so hang on."
okay. we'll be watching our antenna. we're still on high gain.
okay. it's coming down into the field of view.
have at her.
"okay, pete. i've got the target."
good show.
looks pretty good down there.
what do we do with it? which way are we -
"boy, oh boy, houston. do we have a fantastic view of copernicus!"
"okay, pete, my boy. i gave you five of my best ones."
"good show, richard. 04 10 32 18 cml let's see. we owe houston - -"
"- - ... snowman look, dick? 04 10 32 21 cml hey, i didn't get half a chance to really look at it that time, jer."
"hey, dick, i don't know if you can see it, but if you can, you ought to take a look at copernicus, there. that is really something else! or 10 32 40 cdr and we owe them an 06, 20, whenever you get stopped. 04 10 32 48 cml yes, i'm just looking at copernicus. houston, let me know when you got the data."
isn't that something? 04 10 32 57 cml sure is.
... clipper.
"where - where are you going, dick? 04 10 33 21 cml i'm going to pitch to 158. just going to let it continue pitching."
"okay - - · 04 10 33 27 cc clipper, houston. we have your data."
okay. for what?
"that's for an 06, 20, and then i'll go out for the ags cal."
"okay, very good."
"look pretty nice down there, pete. 04 10'33 44 cdr i hope so."
"boy, i'll tell you, i can't get over copernicus. houston, that - there's nothing in any other part of the moon that we've seen since we've been here that even looks like that."
"did you get that, clipper?"
yes. time skip
"..., houston."
"go ahead, houston."
roger. we're about a minute from los. everything's looking real good. your computer and everything is fine ....
what's a dua?
... that's your digital uplink assembly.
0hx okay.
"dick, we're doing our integrity checks now."
"okay, pete, i'm just - slowly maneuvering to the burn attitude."
"yankee, intrepid."
"go ahead, pete."
"okay. verify csm tunnel hatch press equalization, the tunnel vent valves closed, and the tunnel vented."
right. verified.
okay.
"what's all - what's all that oil-canning about over there, pete?"
"we're doing our pressure integrity check, dick. we have the cabin coming down to b-l/2, and we're doing our preburn checks, and we just reset the cabin to 5 now."
sure making all kinds of noise.
"yankee clipper, intrepid. we're going to pressurize the dps now; you may hear something."
okay.
bastards'
... seen before ...
...
how you guys doing over there?
"we're just completing the prep for undocking, dick."
okay.
"hey, dick, i hold at 23 minutes and 48, 47, 46 sec- onds from undock. 0b 11 30 16 cmp okay ...."
we're complete and we're standing by.
"dick, what time's aos?"
107:44:39.
"hey, dick, did you check the tv?"
"no, i didn't, pete. they got the tape on. i'll check it as soon as we get aos."
they've had the tape running on the back side.
"that was a good show you did, there. sounds like you did a hell of a job tracking."
"thank you, dick."
"well, that's what i'm along for, is to give you all the help i can. it looked pretty good down there, pete."
"what time was aos? 44, dick?"
"yes, that's right. 44:39."
"how's it over there, all buttoned up?"
lots of space. i've got the seat down and the struts off. i'm about to take this suit off.
dirty dog.
i figure i can get into it.
"yes, i got into mine without any help, except for the zipper; and, as long as you've got the lanyards, you're okay."
"hey, al, where'd you put the pad book?"
"it's either in my little stowage compartment or i gave it to you. i don't remember which one, dick. i always - i always keep the pad in that little metal box by my right shoulder."
okay.
"well, i don't find it. i thought you copied a tei pad this morning; but i don't know what you did with it. then."
"well, that's aoout the only place i could keep it, so it's got to either be that - you might look in my tsb, hut i never put anything in there like that. or you might look in yours. seems to me i - i put it in that metal box; just kind of pull everything out and it'll probably be kind of squshed in there."
"okay, i'll find it later, al. i'm not worried about it. it's around somewhere, i'm sure."
i swear i didn't steal it.
okay.
that'll teach you to take the tape recorder when i'm listening to my favorite song.
"oh, you noticed, huh?"
"man, this is some rugged country down there, isn't it?"
you'd better believe it.
"hello, houston; yankee clipper here."
"yankee clipper, houston. loud and clear."
"okay. if you'll kill my tape for me, i'll get the tv on."
yes. okay. i'm going to - -
plus 12 at zero ....
"dick, you couldn't look out the aot and - and see this thing. hell, i can see the stars in broad daylight with the cockpit light up. there it is."
"intrepid, yankee clipper, you're looking good. one minute to los; we'll see you on the other side."
"yes, sir, and after all that jazz about the - the lpd, old aldebaran is a half a degree off in yaw and a half a degree off in pitch, which is at the noise level; and i can see it out the window; no strain."
"beautiful, pete; beautiful."
"okay, it's 1 degree off. forget it."
you want to mark it; you want to mark it with this thing right here?
"no, hell no; i know where it is."
"ail right, babe. get some lights in this thing."
turn them up.
we don't need to - -
"intrepid, houston. is that in relation to your new mark or the old one?"
no. that's right around the 40 mark. it's off about three-quarters of a degree to the right and about a tenth of a degree down in pitch. beautiful. not even worth fooling with.
"you just lost him, pete."
yes.
okay. now wait a minute. where was i?
"hey, dick, go ahead and start catching my data, babe."
you better call him.
"okay, now. this detent closed?"
it's closed .... checked out.
"pgns mode control, att hold."
"yankee clipper, intrepid."
go ahead.
"i'm taking your data, al."
"hello, yankee clipper; intrepid."
go ahead. where'd you go?
i don't know.
"hey, al, go ahead."
"okay. both vhf a, simplmx; record lm data. here it comes, babe."
roger. i was already there.
"hey, yankee clipper; intrepid."
go ahead.
is it all right with you if we turn our track light off?
"sure is. 04 13.07 11 lmp well, we want to save it."
"and, clipper, we're maneuvering to the d0i burn attitude at this time."
okay. how - how many minutes you got to go?
"oh, about 16 - 15-1/2."
"we just passed 1 minute, yankee clipper."
"okay, pete. right with you."

"you're still on vox, pete."

"you didn't give me a verb 82, babe."
"yes, i did. there it is, right there; 60.5 by 8.9."
"okay. give me a vhf ranging, will you please?"
you're ...
okay.

hmm!
what the hell is that?
where?
...
that's the plug; they put them in there. just slide it out.
what is it?
it's just a dummy plug.
"well, that's groovy. 04 13 29 13 _ ... electrical thingamajigs to get in here. you're supposed to put it - in back of the front window. you want to do it?"
okay. 04 13 29 22 _ you got to close up the slack.
all right.

i can't look out. i ain't going to look out.

not yet; i'm just got - getting a 76.

"you're so good, it's fantastic ..."
it's got to be; it's got to be. how about ...
"okay, 146; that's good; 13, that's good enough."
forget it; we ain't doing that one. hope not.
okay. what's next?
"doi postburn report; hemets and gloves on; cabin repress, close; suit gas diverter, egress - -"
"pete, you ought to move the ... that thing could fall off there and hit your dsky, now. you ought to put it somewhere else."
"you can take and put it away, for all i give a - -"
except i can't.
"now, that's complicated."
"boy, are you moving across that surface."
"here ... yes, i can tell we're going down, ... hear that thing."
"put it in - put it over in there, pete, in one of those bags. your own bag or something like that; get it later."
"i guess when we get down to it, i ought to do that same thing to mine."
"well, let's don't."
what's the trouble?
why?
"what? okay. here, grab it like this. okay."
"okay, now you got that clock counting up or down or something?"
"man, it counts any which way."
you ought to get - -
what was the pdi time?
"pdi time. let me give it to you, babe. 110:20:37."
"110:20, 110:20. another 20 minutes plus 6 minutes. we'll be 35 in a minute, so that would be 25 and 20, 45. put 45 in there. no, no, no, no. i goofed it. put 15 in there. we're going to count now. okay. that's it. now, i'll tell you when. not - no, no. your time's got to go to 35 seconds. it's got to get to 35:37. and i'm watching. okay?"
yes. 04 13'34 8 cdr i need another shot of cold.
"okay. another shot of cold water coming out of the pitcher. it's too little; it's liable to come in too strong, babe. look at this suit drip. man - -"
when do we get acquisition?
we got it right here.
"109:43, huh? 04 13 34 49 lm_ nine minutes."
"okay. man, dick, we're in the pdi attitude which is heads downgoing forward, right pow, and it looks like that we're taking a big dive to the lunar ..."
"yes, i understand. i can watch it."
did you see that engine burn?
yes.
ail the pressure's good and everything?
"yes, 35; just a second. i want to get it, but i ain't going to put that in the clock. i'm right- handed. w."

you don't want to do that now?
no ...
you got the clock counting up?

yes ...?
yes.
let me have it. i'll get - -

yes.
sure don't need something else.
got her?
"yes. 04 13 38 19 _ 110:20:37. okay, it's going to be 38, so 38 from 60 is 22. where can i put these - don't forget to put these - -"

"okay. we won't - we have to get this oxygen right anyway, pete .... them. okay, now what do we got - -"
...!
"sequence camera. i've got that son of a gun set so good, it'll ... let's start it now at the proper moment."
"why don't you go ahead and button this up? cabin repress, close?"
"..., down, but that's okay. cabin repress, close? then what? egress?"
"suit gas diverter, egress. 04 13 39 11 ijmp suit gas diverter, egress. okay?"
"cabin gas return, egress."
"cabin gas return, egress."
"cabin regs a and b, egress."
"there you go, baby."
"updata link switch to data. just as soon as we get those, we need - we get them in 12 more minutes."
...
"as a matter of fact, we ought to see them come up ..."
"yes. watch this, pete."
huh?
you got that in?
"yes, sir."
"okay. we're standing by to do that. hey, what's our pitch attitude?"
109.
109. it's about 14 to minus 2.
that's what i've got. i'm watching for him to come up on - i mean the horizon. i can see earthrise.
i wish i could shoot that shot; it would live for- ever in the annals of our own personal good will. coming up to pdi.
... anything ... that in ...
"... do that. become famous for this. okay, just a minute .... , right here."
"i didn't write down the a0s time, did you?"
"you wrote it down, pete. you already got it on that other page. what the hell's the difference? it gets light here in a minute. we can see it come up."
43:30 - -
"can you hear us, dick?"
"yes, i can hear you. 04 13 41 00 _ you know, it doesn't look any closer to me down here than it does at 60 miles. i frankly can't tell the difference."
"well, you're not that close yet, are you?"
"maybe that's it. heck, i don't know."
i don't imagine we've come down more than 5 or 6 miles. 04 13 41 19 _ i'll look at it right now. the ags thinks we're 50.
fifty miles?
yes.
"the ags thinks we're 50 miles, dick."
take this picture and be famous forever. it's better than when you grab the surveyor by all of its pricks. these photos accumulate. everything tucked away; anything going to fall on our head. i have to go to inverter 1 some day. did you check out those good things i did?
"s-band antenna is forward, right?"
check out the good things i did - you did - we did.
"ail right. coas is to the overhead window; doi postburn report was good; helmets and gloves are on; cabin repress is close; suit gas diverter to egress, egress; cabin regs a and b, egress; and we're standing by for the updata link switch. going to get earthrise in just a second. you ought to have earthrise by now, dick. m_"
not yet. i haven't yet. i'm looking backwards.
"oh, that's right; i forgot."
going to be at 109:46:30. going to be right straight out there or what? i wonder.
"i'm kind of guessing it is. it may be another - yes, there it is- 15-degree inclination. i just always imagined it was right in front of us."
fifteen more seconds.
hey!
huh?
i thought i saw it coming up.
all right; 30 seconds.
"there it is! look at it! gosh darn! ... just click them off. oh, that is fantastic! time skip"
"hello, houston; yankee clipper here."
"yankee clipper, houston. go."

"good, good."
that's affirmative. time skip

(laughter) i'll get the clock. go ahead.

enter. can i do this?
what is it?
"oh, yes, sorry."
"okay, i had it."
on my mark.
okay. we're on the schedule here.
six more minutes - which will be 24. we're right on it.
okay.
"hey, that was a beautiful alignment."
"we can do it, babe (laughter)."
i'm just sorry that damned thing stuck.
"you'd never know i hit it three times and it didn't, and, all of a sudden it just did, when i was up there doing the other."
"that's okay. i backed off 32 feet, that's all. cost us a little gas. so i got interested - i had to stop and think, ""what did it mean?"""
i need to check the r-dot.
"and i went right through that 100 feet per second, that's all."
what's that r-dot?
"r-dot? 288, 288."
there you go.
what straps are holding you down? ail of them?
yes. what ...
you got this thing back in egress - in egress again?
"yes, sir."
something smells terrible in here. you notice that?
"probably in this - probably all this stuff flying this around, maybe."
"well, but the suit loop's buttoned up."
yes.
it smells like ammonia.
"i don't smell it, and i got a real good sniffer."
okay.
"okay, i'm going to go ahead and take her - a mark here and get on this schedule."
yes.

we're smoking right along; it looks like - -

"yes, 49.2 .... got a 46 - 503 and that's - minus 273; 5030 - -"
"look, is our recorder off?"
"- - 27330. no, it's on."
okay.

"well, tell you; we're bringing you a dirty, grubby spacecraft."
mark.
"178, clear, 316, plus 01780. i hope we make a good ags solution here. like to do it. clear. 415, plus 10 000. standing by to make the next set of marks. okay, pete. things are looking good. man, it was spectacular looking out. you should have seen that descent stage - that - all that jazz."
i saw it.
"did you? and then it - when we pitched over, i could see the descent stage like you said."
"yes, i couldn't see it. that camera stopped. it would'va been fantastic. i don't know when it stopped - -"
son of a bitch!
pile of junk.
"really pisses you off, doesn't it?"
"it does, that's a fantastic thing to show somebody."
"27. i'm going to take an r-dot right here. clipper, that'd be 253, 254, 252, clear, 503, minus 0, 2540."
two more marks and i'll get a look at a solution for you.
okay.
"enter. 173, 873 miles, 73 miles, clear. 05 22 35 _1 cdr what'd you do, break lock, dick?"
...
did you see us lift off?
negative.
"hey, ... see that? it is working."
okay.
that main shutoff valve has done it again.
"i got to ask dick something and see if he'll do something for me. hey, dick. call me back when you got - have about 2 or 3 minutes."
...
how about giving me a long count?
"roger. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10; 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. over."
okay. do you hear me okay?
yes. i hear you fine.
okey-doke. is your ranging on?
yes. it's okay.
"okay, babe."
how's ... down there; i'm locked on again.
"168.2, clear, 503, minus 1682, enter. i did that wrong. i bombed that damn ags right there."
what did you do?
"i entered a range instead of a range rate. let me see what it says - let me see what it says. r-dot. see, bombed the hell out of it."
"well, put it right back in again. it won't bomb it. hurry. put in - push a right range rate in."
it won't work.
why?
watch it. it drives it way out; there's no way to bring it back. just give me an update.
ail right. i can't do it right now.
whenever you can.
"ail right, here, let's copy this down; 16.8 delta-h."
wait a second. 16.8.
58:11.
58:11.
37:59.
okay.
pro.
47.0.
47.0.
"okay, dick. my first solution is 47.0."
"okay. pete, ..."
"okay, my csi - cdh looks like minus 7.9 and minus 8.3."
okay_ we're counting.
"okay. 05 22'38 59 cdr okay, i'll look-see."
where'd that - 0 verb 90 at 15. okay.
"give me - give me an update, would you? just a second; just a second."
"high bit rate. what a dope! 05 22 39 19 lmi okay, go. if we start new, maybe i can do better."
ail right. i can't hardly tell the difference between one-sixth g - -
okay. sounds good. i'll be working on out-of-plane here for you.
"okay, dick. you say you're working on the out-of- plane? you're very garbled."
roger. give me the csi time again.
"csi time, 143:01:50.60."
okay. i - i got my attitude.
"can you look here, pete?"
"do it right this time if it hurts. 162, ... son of bitch, beat you y_ going to get a ..."
coming up on 20.
"guess if we really did run it on ags alone, i'd have to do the charts right now."
verb 67.
okay.
"hey, pete, your out-of-plane is plus 1.8 feet per second."
"okay. well, forget it."
"59, clear, 6 plus 0, 590. hit her."
and i had to circle ... auto ...
how much?
a third of a mile.
a third of a mile?
that's affirmative.
okay. you're very garbled.
how do you read me now?
"just a little bit better, but you're still - -"
"check rcs, eps, and the whole smash."
- - garbled.
...
okay.
"hey, why are we using so much system b?"
probably because that's what we're on.
okay.
we're on - we're on 11.
"are we in the right dap, you suppose?"
system b. i'll switch it. can't switch it?
...
"..., pete."
"you're hard to read, dick, babe."
what did you have after csi?
"it had 46.5, dick."
it did?
where'd we go?
"huh? oh, no, i just let it - i'm flying it. i was just trying to save some gas. 05 22 44 39 _ yes, well, we're off ... wonder why it's using so much."
i don't save a hell of a lot of gas. that system was low when we started.
i'm going to go back into auto here.
i think the thing to do - i think one of the things we might want to do - -
i'm in the 1-degree deadband.
bugs me.
i'm ... in ... 38.8 ...
"how much, 48.8?"
38.8.
"38.8. that's not very good, dick."
just a minute ...... there.
we - we agree almost exactly with the ground.
dps and ecs; cps and ecs. what a dope.
"you're sure doing a lot of thinking. forget it. i show 0.26 miies out-of-plane, dick, and minus 0.4, so i'm going to forget them."
got that.
"hey, i'm going to let this go to 8 minutes."
okay.
"i was dumbhead for letting that son of a bitch overspeed, wasn't i?"
both of us were dumbheads.
huh? ·05 22 48 15 lmp both of us - -
"hey, that was a no-sweat. you know that?"
"sure, it was a no-sweat."
and you know what we should have done - -
we should have briefed for just that.
ail you had to do was close them anyhow and leave that crossfeed open.
but i said - you didn't hear me say it?
yes. i - i just freak. that's me - i freaked up. i should have left you alone over there and stayed on my own business. my fault.
turn the floods down a minute.
"just a second, pete."
"boy, is that him?"
got a goddamn star out there.
"we're not in bad shape. what have we got? 80, 66."
"tell you what, if you want to even them up, we can crossfeed during this burn."
okay.
...
"darn it, dick, you're unreadable. say again."
"loud and clear. i was just ... to houston, right now."
"oh, okay. you got a flashing light on or anything?"
no. i've got the overhead eva lights and the rendezvous lights on.
and we're still 150 miles away or something.
"give me an r and r-dot, would you, pete, in 10 minutes_"
r and r-dot in 10 minutes - -
that's right.
okay. r's going to be - -
"hey, i like this."
"yes. r-dot's going to be 1 - let's see, it's going to be 71; no, it might be 70."
"well, let's hope the old probe works."
mark.
148.2 at 70 feet per second.
"i'm doing it. i've got a ... - 70, 76."
"okay, pete. i got 45.9 feet."
45.9. that sounds a lot better. okay.
... t
okay. i'm going to final comp in one more mark; just a second; it's coming up now.
that'd be 44.9 converted. 05 22 53 03 _p i get 45 - 45.0 off the chart.
okay.
that's not too bad.
"al, am i supposed to maneuver?"
"what? yes, go ahead and maneuver."
maneuver yourself - -
okay. · 05 22 54 48 cmp how you're doing?
how you guys doing down there?
"hey, should we be on some other antenna?"
forward.
...
"oh, okay. very good. i'm about to lose my radar on you."
do you mind if i have noun 85 back?
"i don't mind a bit, if that's what you need."
pretty full one.
"why, you want to crossfeed?"
yes.
open the crossfeed.
close system b.
close system b.
"now, just hope like hell system a is really and truly on. let's watch these pressures."
"how you read me, dick? okay?"
"loud and clear, pete."
all right. five minutes to the burn.
okay.
okay.
"boy, i really like to watch those thrusters fire out there. that's neat-o. when do we - when do we come out in the sunrise?"
right after - right after we see the sun.
okay. i'm not so mad at myself anymore.
why?
"i've written those down, and i solved this thing."
... for my p56.
say again. o5 22 57 28 c_p ...
"45.3, is that right, al?"
"that's right, 45.3. 05 22 57 38 cml that's a plus 45.3. zips in, huh?"
that's right. i think you got to add one to it or something. i know we have to subtract one from your s.
i already did.
not bad ......
"... on mine, though."
inutes to the seconds.
how are - you look about half a degree.
"oh, yes. we're all set to go. no sweat, it says here in fine print."
"i did the delta delta-t and got 45.1, by using the delta delta-t thing. &"
not too bad for a dope.
i'm going to do better next trip.
"well, you been lonely without us?"
"well, just a little bit. i've been cleaning up for you."
"man, we're going to dirty it up, pal. i'll tell you, we'll do our best, hut we are filthy. i don't really think it's that bad, though. most of it will stay in the lm."
i hope to heck it does.
"okay, dick, 2 minutes to burn."
i hear you.
"i see your flashing light out there, now."
"no, i don't either."
"hey, are you guys burning?"
"are you going to burn, pete?"
how are you doing?
how are you doing?
...
"how's it going? 05 23 oh 09 cdr hello, dick. how do you read? over."
loud and clear.
"okay. now, look, something's screwy on this comm - -"
burn's complete.
burn's complete.
we got the burn's complete.
our burn's complete. our burn's complete.
okay_ you're cutting in and out pretty bad ....
say again.
you're cutting in and out pretty badly.
"okay. now, look, i'm transmitting to you - now, come on, god damn it."
"look, let me get the comm right. do you want me to get the comm right or not? something's wrong with it. okay. i'll just leave it like it was."
just - just all i want to do - 521 alarm. what's that? freaking son of a bitch. 05 23 04 46 _4p it's in your g&n - -
"i got it, never mind. could not read radar. all right. god - god damn, i know what the hell's the matter here."
"now, he's got it. ail right, will you write this number down?"
i sure will.
"three, six, ... 144, all zips, 1.53, that's csi time."
okay.
"dick, how do you read?"
"loud and clear, now."
"i'll be goddamned if i know what's wrong with it. stupid son of a bitch. ail right, we're in sun- light. our cs cdh 144:00:1 - -"
5.2.
no. one second point 53. 1.53.
say it again. 1 point zero - -
00:01.53.
what time do you want the ...?
just a second. i'll figure it out.
what in christ's name is this?
how about - -
"what the hell happened to the reset - the - we're not going back to 10 010, are we?"
"pete, do you want me to put 143:30 as the plane- change time?"
"that's fine, if that's what it's supposed to be."
"okay, well, that's rounding off to the nearest - -"
"now, what happened to the damn - hey, dick, how about a plane-change time of 143:307 over."
that sounds good.
"okay. that's the one. oh, there it is. i'm looking on the wrong page."
okay.
"boy, that comm makes me mad."
does me too. that's why i wanted to try to figure it out there for you.
"no, but see, i got a program alarm and a tracker light - -"
okay.
- - and a bunch of other crap.
how about giving me an ags update?
just 1 - -
when you can.
- - 1 second.
are you in ...?
"yes, we are."
"yes. sure are, dick."
"now, look, i got the vhf in forward and that's where we've been flying it, and it worked great. only today, it ain't working so great. why, z don't know."
"verb 47, enter. there you go."
wait a second. wait a second. go.
"hey, dick, it never fails to do that. i'll be goddamned if i know. we're talking to you fine up until 1 minute, and then you can't hear me. now, it could be that, when i'm burning, my thrusters are doing something that's blocking that vhf."
"the only trouble is, he goes out even before you start burning."
"... too, pete."
"but i think you and i have very poor comm with one another today. i can hardly understand - understand you; you're so garbled. ney, pull that thing to push/cabin and let me - i want to blow my ears a minute."
i can't push/cabin be - -
"well, yes, i go to ear. never mind, stand up. i get it. i'm sorry. i'm asking you to do too much; you play with your ags; i'll do it. i shouldn't get spastic over here, but that freaking program alarm pissed me off. they come up in the middle of_that thing."
"okay. now. what time do we burn - csi was 1 - 143:03, right?"
yes.
01 - -
"no, let me tell you."
"so, you came up with a time of - for the plane change, of - -"
"143:01:50. okay. then you told me cdh was going to be 144:00:01.53, right?"
yes.
i subtracted 30 minutes and rounded it off to 140 and asked you 140 - -
okay.
330.
"yes. say, let me - let me just - let me just check something."
that's the wrong book.
do you want me to set your clock counting down?
"yes. we got plenty of time. this is a long haul. 05 23 10 59 _ yes. i know it. this is a good one. just trying to get organized, here."
"yes. now, i'm - no sweat."
"this job is a son of a bitch, yet. don't knock the time; i've - z've set it for you."
"oh, wait a minute. wait. go ahead."
"okay. i'll be setting it in 8 seconds, 48:30, counting down. boy, that sun is hot. you got sort of stay out of the way, don't you? the other t m"
"you ought to put my window heater back in. see what's happening, here, is we're running on cabin - we're running on suit loop. 05 23 ii 51 lmp that's right."
"if we want to - if we get out of this dumb egress mode, we're not going to - certainly the cabin isn't going to fail, now. we've been in and out - let's get. i'm in cabin right now."
"no, you just went to cabin. here - -"
when you pull this - -
push/cabin. there you go.
"of course, we could screw up the - we could screw up the suit loop, couldn't we? if we - -"
yes.
"- - don't follow this crap, and i'd better go back to egress."
"we need those window heaters, though, just like you say."
"yes. it's funny; the other guys never had to use them. 05 2b 12 30 lmp oh. we maneuvering somewhere, huh? no? okay."
"there you go; that's - see that's the t. at cdh, 1.53. okay. lg"
yes.
... see you in the telescope.
you - you see us in the telescope?
yes.
"enter, 136.5."
"damn, dick. do you - i - i just don't know what in the hell is wrong with this vhf comm. we should have super comm. and i'll tell you, it really makes me mad."
"hey, look at this book just a second."
okay.
"ail right, i don't even know what i want to look at. i want to look at this - -"
"when you did your p76, dick, with my burn in it, did you get any noun 49's afterwards, or did it come right up with a good state vector?"
no. i got a good one ....
"i can't understand you. god darn, you're garbled."
so are you.
"hey, al, what's - let's screw around with something over there. how about the vhf squelches or some- thing? why don't we try that?"
"no, the squelch only applies to us hearing him. and we always hear him."
"well, he's got squelch over there, too - -"
"that's right, so he should screw with his. it doesn't have anything to do with our transmitter. since we always hear him - -"
yes. well - -
...
"- - he's transmitting to us on what, a?"
he's coming to us on b.
"okay. okay. okay, dick, give us a count, will you?"
"roger. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10."
"give us a longer one than that, dick."
"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10; 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. over."
"it's just bad, that's all."
"man, oh man, it's taking a long time thinking this over."
i'll be with you in a second ....
"when do we get a0s, pretty quick?"
a0s is due right - there.
16. should be right now.
"forward, verify comm. what's our pitch attitude? 1477"
"pitch attitude is 145. gosh, i think there is something wrong with my csi program - cdh program. that baby has really been thinking."
sure you got the right numbers in there? you could - -
"there's no numbers, you know, it just comes up with it. there it is. look at that. dick, it shows me 17 mi - 17.1 mile delta-h, b8 minutes and 58 seconds to dpi, and it's only a slip of - well, it makes it 50 - no, it makes it 59 - - day 7"
"... look at these, 06 00 26 1_ lmp hmmm."

that's right.
what you guys doing on your ...?
"remember where we put it, al?"
_at?
the helmet stowage bag? is it there?
i got one.
"we left - we took our helmets out of them, and we handed them all back to you, dick."
"well, i got one."
i don't know what's giving.
let me look - -
maybewe stuck it back on the wall.
let me get your gloves in there; i'll show you.
we obviously stuck them back on the wall.
what if we didn't; i didn't; dick didn't.
"(laughter) okay, look on that checklist, and see what else - -"
"you got it, babe? you got the checklist?"
"no, you took it back from me."
"no, sir. i put it right up there. right here. ... pete. i just didn't hear you."
"okay, gloves, four; helmets, one so far. lunar boots; hell, we didn't bring any back. 06 02 46 17 i_mp ..."
"you'll remember to bring your helmet. we just need ... and we ... 30 bags of extra rocks .... surveyor bag. vacuum pga. we've received b-5 and 6. cut ... to no gimbals. hey, i'll tell you what i haven't seen are those neat personal pref- erence kits."
i'll tell you where they are.
okay.
"one of them is on the very back, back there with the flag."
"very back, back there with the flag? there isn't a thing back here, al."
"yes, there is, in that lunar boot compartment. 06 02 46 56 cdh which one, the lower one?"
"i think it's the upper, pete."
there isn't an_'thing in here.
"right there it is. no, no, that's a pad i just flagged in there yesterday. well, look in the lower one then. well, no, it's the compartment behind us, pete."
"no, there's nothing in there; i just looked. we just ... no freaking flag anywhere in sight."
"yes, there is."
there they are.
"well s wait, let me give you something else while you're getting there."
yes.
"here's - here's - i don't know where they are all coming from, but - here's the flag one; give that to dick."
yes.
and this - this is the one that got - this that we cut out yesterday. you know?
"yes, why don't you hang onto that right now, and - -"

"hey, dick?"

"you watch for a couple of seconds, al."
... with the dse tape.
we don't need any more ... or afrin.
"pep pills, either."
how'd you like that one today?
"pretty good, i guess. i feel pretty good."
what does it say on the checklist about getting dse tape to the ...? is there anything more than turn the tape off?
"no, i'll get it. let me get on - lower tape recorder circuit breaker."
where is that? probably on my side.
"someplace there in the comm, isn't it?"
"oh, no, it's over on your side. 06 02 49 h6 cdr is it?"
yes.
"hey, dick?"
yes.
cut the dse.
take this ...
"wait, wait, wait, let's - -"
"no, no, wait a minute; you don't want to wind up with that stuff in your ... take the pills out of it; ...? junk?"
some of that belongs in there in that -
"oh, it does?"
"yes, like a - take that over, and i'll offload it and bring it back."
"okay, i think you're going to be stuck with it."
"well, i don't think it's - well, let me have it to put it in here."
we're not supposed to.
why don't i just - -
i'll do it; i'll figure out the best way.
"well, i've got a set of pills i got to get rid of. we ought - - 06 02 50 51 _ yes .... - -"
- - we ought to leave that kit though on this lm stowage.
we'll leave the kit in here; i'll take it over there and then after we get our suit off ...
"okay, al."
i don't know what you do with these drops but they're nice.
"... no damn wonder. this ... stays over here. if people saw this, they wouldn't believe it."
got to go do - - !
"... i think we ought to put that clean - that cleaner stuff, and some of the dirty stuff and hand back the bag. 06 02 5i 42 cdr yes."
"then, we can get rid of this stuff."
a1 says that we can put this kleenex and some the other stuff that's in this bag - -
got a ... there isn't any place to put it though. it won't stay stuck.
if we could get going with it - we'll have to put everything in the same bag. it's a freaking mess.
why the hell you packing all this shit?
"well, we've got to bring the data books back."
what the hell else is in it?
"hey, what do we need that kleenex for, al?"
we don't; i thought you wanted it.
"freak, i don't want it. give me the kleenex, and i'll leave that over here. we got plenty of kleenex - -"
"what next, pete?"
"hey, take that kleenex back, and take the kleenex out of it, and stick those pills in it. okay. take those kleenexes out - -"
i got it; i got it. the pills kit - here's the pill kit. let's throw the pills in and leave the kit here. there you go? just a minute -
that'll do the job right there.
... but we have to do this.
you sure this is full?
here you are. good luck.
"what do you want out of here, just the pills? 06 02 52 54 i_mp i want - the only thing i want - no. let me show you what belongs in the command module. ail i want is enough sleeping pills so that i don't have to fall on my - -"

"ail right. yes. don't forget that. hey, richard?"

i don't know; he -
i want to take it.
he wants to take them.
tell him i can sell them.
he doesn't - he doesn't want to get pregnant.
he can take the goddamned thing and stuff it for all i give a shit.
he doesn't want to get p t.
tell him i'm going to sell them .... make a profit.
"he can - could do that, too."
"you know, that looks like it's ... in that cloud of shit (laughter). the freak ... has gone crazy since we left."
"nobody - by golly, put those there. there's a couple of good towels."
yes. there's a couple of good towels_ we'll need those.
"the blue ones. you won't be going, pete; i've been pretty good here, as a matter of fact."
"... goodness sakes, i don't know where the time went to ...."
...
"you know how far we went today? we did a 1-mile traverse, today."
one mile - -
i got all the surveyor stuff. we - we were leaping over that lunar surface like a freaking bunch of gazelles.
it - it's wild.
"it really is. i really got to where it felt like i was at home. i really thought i could step out of that stuff, then just walk around the corner to the nearest drugstore."
"like you said, by the time you get good at it, you bail out."
yes.
"well, i'll tell you, i learned a lot though."
we could sure make some improvements in stuff.
you're not kidding.
"... 06 02 56 25 i24p i mean not only besides being dirty, dick - look at my back. that freaking thing is practically torn out x ail it did was 8 hours' worth of eva."

"oh, okay."
... we have 3 hours for ...

what's the jettison time?
forty-eight even ...
that's an hour and 3 minutes from now.
"yes. what you're thinking of is burn time, al, and that's an hour after that. 06 02 57 21 i/mp that's right."

"well, i - here's two of them."
"take both of them. 06 02 58 36 _ i'll take it ..., if you like."
"yes, but it says take them. how about that camera stuff back there? let's get that son of a bitch, too. can we get that?"
"no, i - i don't think so, pete. it's a - -"
did you take the power off it? ... cut it.
"no, that's against the rules. it would be good if we could do it. not these, though. we know it runs through this circuit breaker, so we could pull it out and cut it if you want it, but with neat ..., there's nothing that had to be cut."
okay.
just a minute .... we'll both get the lights.
okay.
let's go.
"you got the other light thing set for go, huh?"
"yes. it's in there somewhere; it must be it's ... this round ... okay, now. ail you got to do is cut that stuff off, a1 - -"
yes - -

"yes. i got it. 06 02 59 25 i_mp now, i need my scissors which are right here. yes. boy, we got it made ...."
i'm going to go over and start getting out of my suit then.
"okay, that'll be good. and then by the time i get there - -"
"wonder where these lcgs go? back in the same place? dick? 06 02 59 43 i_mp well, why can't we jettison the lcg?"
we can. 06 02 59 47 iimp let's get rid of them.
yes.
... for me.
these goodies on the i_m? hey. 06 03 00 00 i_mp what?
... not take our plss antennas; that's a good thing.
that's a good idea. there's no doubt about it; it cuts right on. that's ... a neat little thing ...
something happened to it.
"hey, get me the ..."
don't let it - don't let it get wrinkled. you know where i kept it?
"put it there, dick."
"yes, i want to keep that for a while."

- - decongestant or 10 or whatever it is.
"165. okay, i'm just going to put this back."
"how did i get the world's greatest cold on the moon, for christ's sake?"
because you had the world's greatest lmp with you at the moon.
"who had a cold. and i kept bullshitting houston and saying ""aw, ..., it's just stuffy up here."""
"that's the way to play it, though."
"and a1 bean was - that's right, that's the way i got to play it right now. i'll tell them i took the decongestant, but i ain't got a cold, like - (sneeze) nothing, let them figure that."
"how come you're taking 24 minutes to track it, and i'm only taking 8 minutes of pictures?"
... tracking.
i'm just reading this shit right here.
"oh. it's six frames a second, 1-1/2 magazines, 24 minutes of film. that's why he's doing it."
"what's he telling you? oh, is that what he's trying - try one of those ..."
"well, i don't see why - -"
"so you know how much film you got, how long it will last, how many minutes."
"- - ... must be at least six frames. must be at least ... in there and somebody will want to know it, so ..."
"i guess so. they don't know what the assignment is, and what they do, they want to let you know what the film capability is. okay, i'll get on with the film, now."
are we on the back side of the moon yet?
yes. 06 18 15 42 cml we're in the dark.
can i dump?
"no, we're in - we're aos."
los? 06 18 15 54 i/rfp ... sound.
"oh, shit! i keep forgetting to get my rag for these goddamned pissers."
.....
"hey, what the hell difference does it make to those guys where you dump?"
"they can see it on their msfn data. 06 18 16 05 cml well, what - -"
well - -
maybe they want to - -
tell me what difference it makes.
"ail right. when you come out on the front side, they pick you up and they track you all the way across, and they can project ahead. okay, if you dump on the back side, you ... pop at it just like pdi, and you're not where you're supposed to be. o6 18 16 20 omp so?"
"they - then - then, they have your error. right there, they'd know what the error was you put in. apparently, it doesn't do that. it just freaks up the way their processers work. if you - -"
i think that's what it does.
- - disturb it during their tracking - -
... point - -
- - ... - the main thing is that the proeesser assumes that you're not making any delta-v. if you make it on the back side - -
"yes, that's right."
- - it can accouat for it.
you're right. that's right. let's forget all about it.
... good way ...
they donrt need that information.
"oh, yes. what they - what they - -"
going home.
"oh, well, that's what - why they want that informat ion."
going home.

they - they start that long range - -

"we'll get the delta-v t to burn time, ..."
we'll get all of it. - -
"... last long. i don't think we'll get a high ... from tei. 06 18 21 14 i24p you might. why don't you put it on there, it won't hurt ...."
"we only have 20 feet a second left over, huh?"
"not much margin, is it?"
"wouldn't be worried about an overburn, would you?"
"shoot, underburn."
how about burning depletion?
couple of hundred feet per second ....
which crater did you guys go to? you landed right there. you're at the head crater.
we landed nearly right there. we walked over and looked in that one - at the first eva when - -
yes.
- - we deployed the alsep.
yes.
the next day we went to head crater - -
right there.
"- - and then we went over to this one, and we went to another one up there and then we came back by the far side of this one again, and we viewed surveyor crater and all the way around that son of a bitch and back here."
was this a pretty deep - -
about a mile.
was this a pretty deep one?
yes.
was it a big crater?
"yes. that's - that's - that's - a fairly large one. 06 18 22 43 iafp i tell you, we'll have to take ... of this one so we can see what this one - -"
what ... you taking? 06 18 22 48 iaip ...
is that right?
yes.
(clears throat) go back one picture.
i'm playing your tape - -
one more.
"- - and you've got it, dick gordon."
"yes. that's just - just what i saw. when i saw where we were, all i saw was 1, 2, 3, 4, that one over there and that snowman, and i didn't see another freaking thing. sure did. it looked just like it - you know, i looked up there and saw all these goddamn things and said, ""shit, where am i?"" and then all of a sudden - _qnmmo! it just - it leaped out like a neon sign."
"get the longitude, because i've found (clears throat) everytime i come across, if i find ..."
yes.
".,. and make an i, i can find the snowman. i couldn't find these - this - you got to find this line here first, you know. kind of a strange longitude."
it sure is.
the ... or something.
right over here; what's the first one? descartes's the first one.
"ail right. i'll tell you what, let's - what's the map update? let's start - we have the .,. all we need is the meridian."
no. 180 is the meridian is at 162:38.
"162:38. 162:38, we've got 14 minutes on that. start a clock at 14 minutes. why is the 02 - i know why the 02 high comes on - here it comes."
...
you left sleeper on.
"okay. let's look at this thing, because we're going to run out of - i've only got four more lines at the bottom of this pad."
...
"according to hoyle, down to seconds .... da and - now, you think that'll be on this?"
no.
how about that?
no.
how about that?
no.
how about any of that?
no.
"okay. well, then i'll just start - -"
... like a p30 pad. it'll be okay.
okay.
down to the boresight star. 06 18 25 51 lmi okay. that's what i wanted. none of this other.
"now, look."
how about the sep card? i ·!
"where - where is your, where's your - where's your -"
"..., pete."
"no, wait just a second. where's your - the one we just burned?"
"we can't - oh, i know what you're saying."
"just look at a regular one that we've burned; see. and it'll tell you exactly what to ... take loi, wherever the freaker is, spc 2. that's a loi minus 5. there, you got it? i'll bet you a dollar the tei comes out that way. it is; it's going to come out with the lat/long - -"
it's going to come out with the whole ... you know that?
"well, i'll just go down to the end of it and jump over there. that's life, pure and simple."
"yes, it is."
where's your-target-of-opportunity map? i'd like to look at descartes.
"well, we can get it all on there, if you'll just put it down here."
... - - 06 18 27 22 cml i got it.
"that would be an awful thing, wouldn't it? go for 4 days without comm and trail in there to the second at ... 5g.... the sext stars all up. is that on that pad?"
"yes, you can - -"
"yes, it'll be here - -"
- - sext star. it'll be the one with the writing.
... do it. sext - stars. r aligned - p aligned - y aligned .... right out the window.
... can't add the numbers in.
"wish you'd - hey, dick gordon, i'm playing it. i - -"
"oh, okay."
i don't know. has dick gordon got a tape right there handy?
i don't know where it went to.
i just wanted to play it. 06 18 29 18 _ where is my tape?
"oh, you got to be kidding me - -"
what?
... right there.
right where? i haven't seen it for a while. it was in there - maybe i've got it here. 06 18 29 34 _ i'm going to pick that up before something happens to it....
"i don't know where my tape is; it's up there some- where, i guess."
i'll be ...
jesus christ! here's another earpiece. who's the hell is that?
it's probably mine. i - -
- - ... freaking earpieces?
they must have put 400 earpieces in.
pc - pete conrad.
"yes, sir. every goddamn earpiece - i keep throwing them in the garbage (laughter) and they keep getting back out of the bag."
here's the extra ... how about that?
got to have an earpiece to it.
not hearing it. music
are my tapes ...?
what?
did you find my tape?
"what? no, i don't know that it's not there. i just didn't look. i ..."
what's all those ti times?
"descartes, 163:29:12."
"no, i was looking for the map update at a different time."
there goes fra mauro.
"map update. 162:38:38. 162:38:38. 06 18 35 36 _ okay. now, here's the pad. now, let me show you i made - a mistake here. i started to write in some numbers. i'll copy the pad anyway. so, i'll have to write over those numbers with other little numbers and keep going. and it looks exactly like this pad ... and i'll copy it. so, why don't i make - why don't i make another one now, while we're choo-chooing around? especially when i am. turn over and make one on the other side .... good place ..."
i'm going to clean those critters this morning.
how many batteries have we got left? anybody know?
i'd guess about three.
three?
three?
"we might have, but i don't know; we probably ought to inventory. i'll do that later today."
"okay, we've got two homemade pads. illegible."
... put them in the ...
"maybe they didn't figure we were going to get that far, maybe that's why it doesn't have any p30s."
i thought that looked screwy.
... (laughter).
they're full up. what is this?
that's the one back.
nothing for me?
that was the one - no - that was the one back.
"no, that's - that is - that is tei."
"when i get a tei back, i'll copy it."
what rev are we on anyway? huh? what rev are we on?
"well, i - -"
forty-one? and we just started 42?
okay.
wait a minute; i've got all kinds of pencils here. who's lost one?
a1 bean lost one.
"no, he found it. i'll tell you what i have lost."
"you don't have - hey, these both look like lunar surface ones."
"hey, one of those might be mine. have you got yours, dick? 06 18 4_ 22 cmp what?"
pen?
yes.
figure out - -
which one's mine? - -
- - which one's yours?
i don't know; i have no way to figure. just give me one.
"say! hey, i didn't lose it."
"... good news. 06 18 45 42 _ okay, we've got the pads under control now. what's the next job? i've got a couple of sick pads here."
"you ought to quit drawing on the screen ... we could read them ... they ought to furnish a screen llke that one, ..."
"boy, that's a great song. what the hell's the name of it?"
that ... is doing okay.
where's my ...?
"you know, it seems like i'm doing this son of a bitch just too much around here on certain days."
"hand me the tool, would you, dick?"
do what?
tool e.
"pete, can you put tool e down there?"
yes.
... always ...
i got to get this junk out of here.
that may be the answer.
"just get the tape down, would you?"
"oh, yes. here it is, right here."
... parts off.
can't help you there.
"get this junk here. you get that one, and i'll get this one."
not too bad today.
i've already cleaned it once today.
"oh, you already have, no wonder. pretty good. doesn't have anything on it here."
"good. oh, shit- sorry."
look at that son of a bitch.
what's that?
i don't see it.
yes. right there in the pre-tei systems checks.
"that already ...? shit, you guys could be doing that while i'm tracking."
"hell, yes."
"yes, yes."
there's nothing there.
"besides we can he - in fact, it's early."
could do - -
what the hell are they going to give you - a no-go?
you could do those pre-tei system checks right now.
"that's right, what's it going to do? if you got a bad system, you want to go home more (laughter). that 's ridiculous."
"(laughter) you know, it's really funny. we just ... - - 06 18 50 12 _ we're no-go for tei. - -"
- - the ecs system is no-go for tei.
"it'll work in lunar orbit, but it won't get you home."
we'll get it.
oh. check that - give me 4 minutes.
one burn!
"ail you need is 4 minutes, yes. we'll get a dividend out of it."
herschel.
"herschel. that's right. freak. you know what's going to happen, don't you, gordon? i'll make a prediction."
they'll probably name it herschel.
"not only that. not only that. but they are going to look at the freaking high rev photography of herschel, and they are going to make some great discovery."
that's right - -
... - -
they're also going to decide to land there or something - -
"- - just like when we photographed the wrong freaking star that - that - that what's-his-name told us to - he says, ""i know i can find those two stars. why don't we get the other in the wrong attitude."" ""no,"" he said, ""that's where we go uv in that spectrum region of the stars."" and that - if they don't call high-handed statements, for christ's sake - -"
did you really?
yes ....
"i read all of his reports, too. it didn't say anything about us photographing the wrong one."
oh. is that right?
"i couldn't see. and dick was standing outside, because, hell, with all those ..., you know, you turn the camera on and off."
"oh, here comes the sunshine. off to my window - pane."
"i'll tell you, that one-sixth g was really great. and you need a goddamned ... with you. if you're standing on the floor and you want to go sit on the engine cover? you just go (whistle) (hum) - -"
the things you couldn't reach. - you - you know ... and that plss - -
you'd just go - -
- - didn't that plss feel great?
"- - you'd just go (whistle) and grab it, and you'd fall right back down gently. a1 would say, ""hand me my plss."" and you'd reach over and you'd pick that - -"
one hand - -
- - son of a bitch up like - (laughter).
"hey, i'll tell you what we need. with that plss on and your suit on, you were better than just your suit on in one g. didn't you think so?"
"oh, yes. oh, yes - -"
"freak, you can run and - -"
"you know me; i hate to run. shit, that's all i was - did was - -"
"you can't walk up there. you got to run. there's no way you can walk. and you have to botmce. you land flatfooted like this. you see, you can't bend your knees. so, you land flatfooted like this and you go boing."
"that's why your plss comes in handy. 06 18 52 52 kmp yes. and so, then, you - so that means you can take turns, but you have to have your center of gravity over your - over your foot. so you end up going - rocking from side to side. it's real funny; you go like this - way over. because, when you come down, you'll - -"
"... go bong, bong - -"
- - center of gravity. and - and it's fun. you can run up hills and everything else.
"except i noticed, we didn't get too speedy coming up out of that surveyor crater."
"yes, because - because we kept running on the edge. we didn't just hit one. we - you can't - we all - here's how we were running, coming out of that surveyor crater. you can't do that. so, it just took one high bounce to get us up ... high ... if you don't go up all the way on it, coming down ..."
that's too bad that cotton-picking tv didn't work after all that effort.
"hey, i'll say it is. i'd have loved to show them that surveyor. we could have pointed at it ... - that surveyor."
"we could have pointed out the alsep, too, because even at 400 feet, it looks like you're - -"
yes.
- - standing over there.
yes.
"they could probably have seen that whole alsep thing. when they found a1 bean freaked it up, oh."
heard you freaked up.
"oh, you didn't freak it up."
"i'm telling you, i suspect i did. i - -"
no - - 06 18 54 26 i_mp - - can't figure out it ever did anything else.
"al, you didn't do it. god damn it!"
there ain't nothing i could do - if i did.
"if you - if you did, they sure as shit didn't give you adequate warning that - they - they should know that the lm structures are too bright for that sun- light, and they should have told us. christ's sake, i didn't - i - stopped down to f:22; i would have thought you could have shown it on anything except directly into the sun."
"well, we'll have to see what happened."
i'm really - i got the lunar crud. i really do. i -
"hey, make sure that thing is stopped down. the low setting is 2.2. the high setting is 22. and you can't tell the difference hardly. i never saw the freaking camera."
i don't know what they had it set on for - course - -
probably 2.2.
"theoretically, i was in the shadow, you know."
"that's right. because, if i had it on 2.2 -"
"i got to get the gimbal angles on that ... man, i yawed that bastard around about 35 degrees; i pitched; i rolled. i was really wheeling and dealing."
"hey, there they come."
"bey, there we go."
you know what it'll turn out to be? i yawed 5 degrees and rolled 5 degrees.
that's ... probable.
"exactly. 06 18 56 13 _ god, this is weird. 06 18 56 15 cml isn't that a speetaeular sight, that sunrise?"
it's unreal.
like it's a different world.
"if you saw that in the movies, you would say, ""god, that's fakey."" that's just what i saw as we were burning loi."
"i think you can see what i saw out the window. if you get real close to this, it's about as big as a - except it was black. it was real funny. it looked like that moon - it looked like that moon was right outside that window, but it was just black - - 06 18 56 55 i_p ... - -"
"pdi. haven't i showed you. i mean, not pdi but - when - when dick had us on the nose."
"oh, yes."
"and when you were sitting sideways - i could see all these stars out that window. and, all of a sudden, it just was black. in fact, it was like that ... thing - it's like somebody in the simulator put a - a ..., and they had had a - one that was too small - you know, the - the sphere was too small."
that's exactly what i think. it's not but 70 degrees over the flight path.
"hey, look at that crater over there, pete."
wait. where?
"look at that son of a bitch. i ought to take some views of that - both sides. it looks like a little copernicus, see?"
yes. look at that - -
... - -
- - find out what it is.
it's a mama mia.
jeez!
here. i got it.
no. he doesn't have any; it's on the back side.
... 06 18 57 48 _ i bet he has some russian name. now you can see the - - time skip
fifteen.
roger. see you at 58. we'll dump to 15.
"hey, dick? ... same side as the ..."
...
mans that engine - that full-increase deal worked perfectly.
"it did, didn't it? where is it now? it's still 06 20 i1 54 cdr 180 degrees."
"... after the burn, it'll be zero."
i bet it will be; i bet it will be.
there they go. by-by.
"by-by, houston. i got to go pee again. t"
"hey, al?"
"yes, sir."
you want to grab tool e and start dumping that water?
"i'll get it. i'll get it, pete. let a1 - -"
okay.
- - fool with those cameras. he's got to - -
"yes, take a leak."
- - ... camera up for him.
waste water's up to 70 percent.
"yes, we'd be better off if we operated two cameras. 06 20 12 52 i2qp yes, we got to set them up down here. because this way we can all - here's the problem. we're not - now, look at that, we never could get all that - p50 done in one run. you'll have one run of it, and then you'll run one through your camera, and you'll be aiming to shoot straight down; you can use the pso and pick up the other stuff - stuff on the left, of course. i'll try to get this stuff to right, of course, for the p50 ... 06 20 13 28 cml i'll get it, ..."
...
... down there. that's good.
huh? why don't you grab it?
... brand new ...
what's the matter?
did you take that - did you take that filter off the camera?
"sure did. it snapped right off. yes - yes, they're supposed to be used to prepare ... if you need them."
"that's why it's crowded down there, dick, they -"
what's that?
ail that shit on the sextant panel.
"... - oh, waste water."
... closed. wait for it to come.
okay.
yes.
...
"i'm just going to do the p50 there with that magazine, i got to come up with another magazine, and - -"
yes.
"- - know that i'm going to use all the film on it. that's going to be the hard part. what do you say, dick?"
"well, we had - we only had two rolls of film. that's all we had."
"we already used a whole bunch. ail this is black and white, isn't it? we don't have another black- and-white roll?"
the only black and white we have is the one we've been using today.
"well, as far as i know - -"
... get them all out. okay.
"- - as far as i know, there's three rolls. now, you only have one more - you only have one more requirement."
"okay. hold up, pete. 06 20 16 16 65ip al? 06 20 16 17 _ yes, let me get - wait, just a minute, let me get a - stereostrip ...."
02 high.
i'm just going to ...
yes.
"let me have the color one, and i'll try to pull it out and get the others."
"well, shit. here's one that you got mags left on. 06 20 17 17 iaip well, that's what i mean. i think there's - what else we got - -"
...
"are we going to use this again anyway, aren't we?"
are we? i've taken two.
but there's plenty on here.
okay ....
here's one that's got 15 on it.
fifteen; what length and color is it?
... stick that color one in your bag.
... seems to be missing.
lm seems to be white.
"45, 35."
"oh no, you're right, 165. so we're going to have to save the black and white then for going away."
"we'll use this, too."
yes ....
and this has got 60. now this is what we've been using on these runs
is that what we been shooting? 60 ...?
hold that a minute.
we throw away more freaking ...
"no, here's the one ..."
what film is that - what is that?
yes ....
something's funny -
...
something's funny.
here's one.
what the hell is this?
this is .... this one is.
something's funny here.
something's funny ...
getting color on this ...
"yes. 06 20 19 05 _ ..., dick, is rotate it every time i've run this."
let's put - -
what have you got on the camera now?
double e.
"that's a brand new roll, too, isn't it? man, you got two rolls here haven't even been expose d yet. these two right here."
this one's dead .... something's going wrong with this film. this one's - ... what the - this - this one's gone all the way around to here.
...
wonder why that light won't go out?
which light?
that. the dump's been off for quite a while. ail the fuel cell purges are - - o2 2o 19 59 cmp ...
- - complete.
"yes, they look all right. i need to make a check, 06 20 20 02 cml 02 flow is - -"
yes.
...
yes. the waste water's been dumped.
"oh, there you go."
"okay wait a minute. let's take ... 02. something's screwball here. look at this. give me that lox card over there, pete."
where?
over beside ...
... 06 20 20 27 i_ put it back on the damn eottonpicker - ... 06 20 20 b2 cmp ...
"who is - oh, is that - herschel, fra mauro, and everything?"
"yes. but i think it's wrong, because it's up here, ..."
...
"... we're okay, but let me just check it.... put the dark side in ... toward ... music (lonesome me)"
"we,re okay ...."
"no, they weren't - it moved."
"shit, we've taken more than 50 photos; i've taken - 80 on the last two alone."
take another one. 06 20 21 38 i_4p everything moves.
"no, but i want to watch this."
it moved then. what the freak is going on here?
"well, it's working anyway, at least we know that. can't do anything about it now. 06 20 21 59 hmp at first, i gave it a whack and thought, that's no way to ...; maybe i didn't start off at the right time .... this thing's - -"
are you sure you haven't taken more film on another roll?
huh?
huh?
"won't make any difference, they can figure it out when they ..."
how's the films coming?
i've got the clock running; we're about 30 minutes from ...
"hey, give me a camera that's had about 100 - let me see that color camera. where's that one i gave you that had all six of ..."
it's in there.
black and white -
... down there.
... something going wrong -
"turn it this way. 06 20 23 02 i24p this says we've taken as many as i think we have. this says we've taken up 100, and i guess we've taken about a 100. it says 190 on here."
...?
... 06 20 _3 18 cmp ...
"no, we advanced, there's no film in ... the film's in it; pull it up."
huh?
what you - what you taking?

"you been clicking the intervalometer right along? 06 20 24 07 i_4p ..., yes."
what time's that first ... landmark tracking?
here's the problem.
it's moving now.
don't worry about it. we're either on there or we're not. 06 20 24 40 i_mp ... nothing you can do about it. 06 20 24 h4 cmp what's - what's my first landmark? pete?
cp-1.
"oh, ..."
i'll get it. cp-1 is 164:52. got - 27 minutes according to our lower equipment bay clock.
okay. here's our ...
... time to do dac.
i am. 06 20 25 14 _ there may be - there may be something wrong with ...
"that's all right, we've got these two."
"let's just use them. next time, let's ..."
...?
lalande. let's use these two magazines.
where - where's the ... you want for lalande ...?
whatever else you get - -
okay.
"okay, that should do it."
i'll buy that.
... something wrong with that .... on the 250 millimeter - -
it's okay.
how's the waste water?
waste water's 15.
"no, not quite."
it's goes on - -
ail right.
huh?
go ahead and turn it off.
... off. 06 20 25 59 cml 0kay_ the potable's open.
"didn't, did it?"
"you ought to drop it a little bit more, dick."
"drop it a little more, dick. that's too ... about 18."
... drop it ...
okay.
"that's good, dick."
three more revs until we get the hell out of here ....
"maneuver by 164:46, dick. here's your flight plan, it's complete up to you."
... flight plan ...
"yes, i need ... other charts here."
trade places with you. i need to go over -
you can have the middle.
"oh, okay."
got to have the ...
"hey, we ought to get some pictures inside this son of a bitch. we haven't got any."
a whole roll.
"hey, we - we didn't - we didn't take any views in the lm, did we, al?"
a whole roll.
"where's the next site, pete, fra mauro? where's the next site, pete? 06 20 29 01 cdr/cmp fra mauro."
that was the last one.
"gee, if those pictures aren't any good - as a matter of fact, we've got - i don't know what you're going to use it for, myself. w"

"- - or maybe all of descartes, i don't know - is on here."
could be.
because i don't remember - i can't honestly say i went around there and looked at this number.
... all on here.
"hang on there, you son of a bitch!"
whose is this?
... watch it ... go on around.
...
"i don't think i even dismounted it to see those ... i know i didn't take 60 pictures of herschel, pete. did you have anything on your camera before?"
not a thing.
"you've got to have part of it, at least some of it - maybe you've got all of it."
...
i don't want any more.
... get it.
"... up there. could have stopped in the middle, i guess. okay."
where you going to be working?
right there.
"wait a second, ..."
"i'll tell you what. i do remember - one time in the middle of the first one, i looked back ... like ..."
"no, that's probably all right."
... under the couch.
but i didn't have time to keep checking it at 6-second intervals ....
the smartest thing for me to do is crawl under the bilge down there and go to sleep for a couple of hours.
why don't yo_ do it?
"that'll be good, that'll let me move my ... off the couch. what do you want ..."
"the way i feel, ..."
"what's our attitude going to be, dick? 06 20 37 30 cml ..."
... ought to be changed.
some of these are far from ...
dick?
yes.
"where are those lines, and i'll get them out of your way."
...
"... 06 20 38 16 cm_ got two revs - ..., let's get ready."
... the cryogenics.
two revs of this -
... cryogenics ...
... in orb rate -
"yes, ... okay."
there's no way to do that ...
"well, you could have just ... pretty soon."
"yes, but i can't put that thing ... intervalometer."
...
okay. now here's what i'll do. let me look and see what we got to do.
use the 85-millimeter lens on it.
"getting hairy out here, too."
"125 is the - probably be ... on that stereostrip, you always use the same setting, huh? ... attitude .... fra mauro."
...
you could probably - put the ... on ...
"oh, yes."
"yes, i think i will."
"... zero phase, ... of which is 4, 5/6ths, let me - that would be - that would be ... 4 5/6ths."
yes.
"... let me look at this .... the object is to minimize ... do that, and we want to get the stuff out of the side, too."
"okay, here's what i'm going to do. i'm going to shoot the 250 from the right side -"
...?
"no, i just want to see it...."
...
that's right. 250 ... we'll probably write it down in here on ...
okay ....
get it out this window.
"yes, ..."
... get it out of mine ...
"that's right, i'll have eight colored ...; second run, i'll just ... okay, that ought to get it all right there."
...
...
... a little bit.
"oh, well."
"quit worrying about it, ... anyway."
"okay, well, i'll take this right here, ... give it a mark ..."
"cool it, man. cool it."
i'll use this black ...
"... (singing, humming)"
... this black and white up here? ...
... black and white ...
"well, you could open up another - ..."
"uh-oh, ... they want color."
"yes, but we don't have any."
they want color ....
...
we don't even have the color.
we got color ...
...
...
"... do it in black and white ... 06 20 43 50 cmld oh, yes?"
yes.
that all right?
... use the best we've got.
...
"15, 7, and 02."
thirteen more minutes. 06 20 44.40 cmp ... a little tracking time around here -
...
...
you got any bread left?
huh?
got any bread left? p
...
maybe we don't have any left. i guess we don't.
... got them all now?
"what's today, friday?"
"why do we care? (laughter) ... had to update this - what do we care, we ain't going anywhere."
salad?
hum?
salad?
it's tuna salad.
"tuna salad, chicken salad."
what are things like ...
i'd like to dig into some of that chow ....
"... a big cocktail. i could use one of those .... white .... lot of good chow, you ought to try some of those."
...?
you charging battery b?
"yes, sir. look like it's charging okay?"
"... not bad ... oh, yes."
"i don't always leave it there, dick. i usually - i don't know whether i should or not, to tell you the truth."
tt doesn't make any difference; that's just the indicator.
"that's right, i never - look at it and make sure it's charging like it's supposed to. see if you don't have any - what the hell is that? 06 20 49 01 cml ouch! sticks out there a long way."
... some day....
"orange grapefruit, that's okay, ..."
"... i'm really ... hey, i'll watch this side, dick. 06 20 49 51 cml okay."
...
leave that light on.
huh?
leave it alone.
...? that happens every time i do a p22.
"man, that's a ..."
"we give them omni b to begin with, i guess .... high gain antenna ... 06 20 52 01 cml you still pumping something?"
... 02 flow ...
i hope they work right for you.
"... that's it, i guess."
...?
guess i'd better .... we always do that ... next few days. 06 20 53 30 cml ... you're right.
... got that in front of us now.... 06 20 56 06 cml ... a lot if it?
"no, i heard it go every single time .... here it go. all i could hear ... it'il go without moving .... 06 20 56 32 i.,mp you don't have anything on that roll ..."
...
"yes, ..."
...
"help you, dick?"
huh?
p38.
"... shows part of that ... hey, we are pitching down. don't ask me why."
"no, p38 ...."
... we're okay. we're orb rate.
"okay, that's right."
"in fact, it's a little late ...."
"..., babe, ..."
landmarks.
"oh, look at that!"
...
look at that!
"..., babe."
... going to be all right.
there's nothing else - -
you can think about that on the way - -
", - ..."
"everything gets nearer and nearer .... you know, i think that had a lot to do with a lot of guys ... when you get out here, babe, you ..."
... way off ...
...
huh?
...
i have. we're still in orb rate.
"yes. that alignment stuff ... looks okay, still too early. that's langrenus straight ahead."
"langrenus? ought to be. you get - hell, that's - get the other one, though .... - -"
yes.
...
"behind him is ..., though."
yes.
okay ....
"look at that earth, look at that earth. i can't believe that!"
what?
"that earth, i just can hardly believe that. 06 21 07 28 l_p oh, man! i'll tell you, i wish i had those pictures more than anything. the thing that reaily fouls you up is the ... - - time skip"
"forty two, mag f."
yes. this one has that
"hell, i don't. i'll get them."
okay.
"okay, jerry. go ahead."
okay. these are the ones on page 3-149.
roger.
"the first one is charlie papa 1: ti is 166:51:23, 166:56:29, north 02. we'll have the lat/long in- formation for you in a few minutes. charlie papa 2: ti is 167:09:42, 167:14:42, north 14. delta echo 1: 167:22:46, 167:27:43, north 02. foxtrot mike 1: 167:33:0 - correction 32, 167:38:32, north 12. over."
"roger; we copied cp-i: 166:51:23, 166:56:29, north 02. cp-2: 167:09:42, 167:14:42, north 14. delta echo 1: 167:22:46, 167:27:43, 2 north. fm-1 - that sounds like an airplane - 167:33:32, 167:38:32, 12 north. over."
that's ... we'll have some other information ...
"i get the same landmarks with what i'm doing right now, jerry."
"12, houston. we're going to take your noun 89s and convert that to your lat/longs for this par- ticular pass. over."
"oh, okay. i see."
...
"apollo 12, houston."
"go ahead, houston."
"roger. on that p22 stuff i just passed up to you, go ahead and use your flight plan lat/longs and mark on the same figures you did on the previous pass."
"you understand that, dick?"
yes. yes.
"okay,"
"i do, i do, i do."
okay.
"okay, jer. understand, we'll mark on the same thing as this pass here."
"what's that one? forty-two or 43, i never can remember. forty-two."
"forty-two, mag. see how the numbers are counting out, dick .... they're doing okay. they don't usually go."
"okay. the next thing ... 06 21 32 36 lmi three in a row, big ones."
we're in 3. i want that to be right.
"hey, houston; apollo 12."
"go, 12."
roger. do you want me to use the same lat/long that's in the flight plan or the one that i just calculated for p227
"dick, use the ones in the flight plan. not the noun 89s."
okay. thank you.
... on the back side.
what was that?
remember to get that battery ... on the back side.
okay.
ohhh! damn. these four are tough marks.
what?
"houston, 12."
"12, houston. go."
"hey, jerry, have the boys check the - the - speed setting on that one. that was a pretty bright target. and i put the film on 1/60th; i think it ought to be about 1/125th. will you check them on that?"
roger. which target was that?
"this last one, fra mauro 1."
okay.
it's still pretty bright.
"okay. dick, while i have you, sometime on the back-side pass here, i think you can expect to see the manifold pressure on the rcs quad c start to dis - decrease, meaning that you've depleted your primary tank."
okay.
we'd like you to switch to secondary on that quad only. ail right?
okay. secondary on c only. thank you. i won't switch unless i see them de - -
do that just when the manifold pressure starts to decrease - -'
that's what i was going to say. i won't switch until i see it decrease.
"good show, dick."
"12, houston. go ahead. we concur with you on your setting for fra mauro. 06 21 44 30 cml3 okay. i'll make it 1/125th on the next pass. time skip"
okey-dokey.
"houston, 12. 06 22 10 tl cc go, 12."
"okay, a1 just put in a con_nent about starting these a little early. i felt that i had to, because that last mark, the target is going out of sight. that's because our field of view in the telescope isn't as much as it is in the sextant, and i think we'd better start a little bit earlier than 40 seconds after t2, and i've done that purposely. any comments? 06 22 11 48 c_ give me that camera, please ...."
got it?
yes. just hand it back to me ...
okay. now you put ... 06 22 12 17 _ seemed like we ...
... you'd like ... already .... quad a ... gdc ...
huh?
i think it probably needs to be in ...
... color or black and white ...
did you ... them up?
this is ... other things to do ...
huh?
do you have ...
... i keep holding on to the nose of this thing ....
what?
it's the ... - the - it looked good. hold this. time skip
you've got black and white left ...
...
that's what i said was we've got more black and white - -
"... that was 16 millimeter. we'll just have to do it without 16 millimeter .... they want the ... with 16 millimeter, and they want a bunch of photos. you've got this running already, it's orb rate. _at we need is to get this stuff .... go to optics, but ... broken ... came apart."
came unglued. but i think i probably screwed up. i think i probably opened it and didn't know it. 06 22 33 35 lhp ... a lot with these things.
"you couldn't get it back together, though, pete."
"no, but that - you know, i don't know anything about these things. maybe if you got your film loaded, it won't go back together and - i don't know about - ..."
where did it come apart? right here?
"no, no, no. it's when you move it - when you move it."
"oh, on the side. yes."
"... instead of the p22. 06 22 34 08 crp i think that the p22 is the way to do it, i really do...."
... stay another rev ...
... stay another rev. we ought to do that. did you get latande the last rev?
...
you're right. let's do that.
... stay for another rev.
let's do that. that would salvage the whole freaking thing and we would have it all on film. 06 22 34 32 civ_ ...
"tell them we got to do that. that's right .... salvage the son of a bitch. otherwise, we could ..."
"yes, i think we ought to do ... going to copy p22 and get the right edge. 06 22 34 52 cd_ yes. tell them we had a camera come apart up here. 06 22 34 55 lp_ yes. you know, too, damn it, we can give them lalande; we get two of them in one run, and one of them in the last run. like we were going to do - - 00 22 35 04 c?,_ ... 06 22 35 08 _v_ ... you are not reserving it .... - -"
"... looked at that earlier and you said you couldn't do it. 06 22 35 17 _mp ... no, no ... between fra mauro and descartes."
"that's right, that's why you couldn't do it all ... without ... 06 22 35 24 _'._ we already ... lalande anyhow, the last run, right? isn't that what the ground said? 06 22 35 29 ci,p yes. 06 22 35 30 _ i mean, what did the ground say about the last one?"
"... if we can do it. 06 22 35 36 _ i think we ought to do it, that's what ... oe 22 35 42 _.i_ ;'_h are wo going to do the last one? 06 22 35 h5 cm_ ... get lalande. o6 22 35 48 cl_p ... sitting out there ... have any batteries running. j_ 22 35 52 _,_' i can't remember to find any of that stuff."
"shoot, yes; i can't find that first mark."
is that right?
"well, maybe we ought to get lalande - just get non and tell him to set up the attitude and the lighting ... get the chance to run the computer ..."
got a p22.
what were we going to do the last run - -
"you got to - got to - actually, all we need to do is get 500, do ..., get all that stuff in the bag, and we'll have everything there. if we don't, we're not going to get the film done. and we got to ..."
"cp-1, i'll have it, and then the other three, and the third one, and we got it all in one pan ... we've done 130, cp-1 - and then - all that."
let me ask you a question. what was the elevation at acquisition of the others? 06 22 41 36 cml there you go.
about 500 ...?
"oh, no, no, no. it was 3 minutes prior to ..."
"ail right, now. do we have enough time to try tp-2?"
"gee whiz, yes."
that's a good ide_.
"now, if you go tp-1 and get a tp-2, and in the meantime they give us a ti t2 for ... - that's that one again."
we have 4 minutes to go until - 5 minutes or so to get back in attitude and get the camera off the ...
"not only that, but i'm - we're not happy with not knowing where they added the first time, anyway. there's only one reason ..."
"it doesn't make any difference when we leave the earth. you can only get to earth in so many seconds every 24 hours. it's just like we had a 4-hour launch window for leaving earth, ... land ·.. sea...."
"well, let me get down here and start working. ouch! 06 22 48 07 _ cmp where the hell's my flight plan?"
it never fails .... magazines ... spacecraft ...
"the only pictures of the flight a1 wanted were the ones of earthrise out of the lm, and i went and left the freaking thing on the lunar surface."
the only way to avoid ... you can ... 06 2249 09 cdr tell me how this happened· i'm sitting here talking to dick and the goddamned thing came open.
"oh, i can't do that .... in a goddamned hurry."
do we have optimum lighting on these things?
"no, i guess not."
these sides popped clear off it?
that freaking camera is forever - - 06 22 53 44 lmi goddamned lift-off with that 16 millimeter was a great shot.
"that's right, son of a bitch."
i don't ...
"what ... attitudes are we in, dick?"
we're right - we ought to be right ...
that's where we are.
"if i could get those two revs worth and go home, ..."
"we had tei, ... at p30. that's a tough one."
how's the earth?
"there it is. hello, earth. man, there's not much earth out there, i'll tell you that."
four more days and there won't be.
we're behind about 3 degrees now.
"do you need the flight plan, dick?"
"not right at the moment; i will shortly, though."
okay.
"hello, houston; yankee clipper."
"okay, houston. you're breaking up."
"come on! get a good signal, let's go."
nothing we can do if we can't ... on what we got.
"he's looking right down the - parallel to it right now, we'll have to wait until we get out a little bit."
"roger. loud and clear. listen, jerry. i've got something real important for you. we were taking some target-of-opportunity photographs with the same film pack that we had the 500-millimeter film on, and, without going into details right now, i'll tell you later when we have the time - that magazine back popped off, and we're not sure we didn't wipe out that film magazine. now, what we suggest is, is that we dump the landmark tracking, seeing as we got good ones last time on descartes and fra mauro, and you pump us up another ti t2 for both of them and let's get some more 500 millimeter this pass on another magazine. okay?"
okay.
"must be ... that way .... , i forgot."
huh? ...
"feeling any better, pete?"
huh? 06 23 01 49 _ feel any better?
"i don't think there's anything wrong other than i have a cold and i get so goddamned tired, i thought maybe i'd crawl down there and go to sleep for an hour."
"oh, yes. yes, you can't sleep too well; all you got was ..."
"go, houston."
hooray!
"okay. let me tell you what happened. we - a1 was very careful to watch all the time we were taking the 500-millimeter pictures to make sure that the camera was, in fact, running, and he was watching the side opposite the counter, which has got the little red-and-white wheel."
is that right? ...
"and, and, and - i mean he was watching the red and white to see if it was taking a picture, and we noticed that we - after we got done, all the 500-millimeter stuff that - we knew we had taken approximately 100 pictures, but the counter only read 60. and we kicked that around for quite a while, and we finally concluded that because a1 had been watching, that there was something wrong with the counter and we really had taken all the pictures. so we decided that we'd use up the rest of that film on targets of opportunity. and while a1 was taking the pictures out the window, the side of the magazine just popped off_ right out of nowhere, for no reason, and it opened up about one-eighth of an inch and al tried to jam it back on and he had to actually open the lock and put it back on."
i never made it on. i had to tape it on.
"oh. he never did make it on, so he taped it on. and we don't know whether it's light struck or not, and we don't know why lt popped open. but, we're surely suspicious. we also don't know if it was only partially on to begin with, or that we really did lose film. so i think it's best that we take a fresh magazine which we have, and we'll get those pictures again."
okay. we agree. they're hustling.
"you write them down for me, i'll get this last control point."
"... attitude, anyway."
i don't know where they are .... ordinarily these are - -
we've got plenty of time.
"let's see, now, what i need to do. we're going to copy that part. we've got him doing such a - get the lighting out of the back ...."
which one is this here?
"descartes, fra mauro."
"f:8, 145 to - it ought to already be there."
yes.
there's that little thing that comes off.
"you know that p30 pad i used for a model, dick? where did it go?"
... did you give it to me?
yes. one of those loose ones.
oh ....
yes. that's right. i was thinking about that. because you get a one-rev-later tei output.
we've already used up one -tei 45 partial .... i think we'll all be better off ...
"i think i might have. i think i might have bothered that one instead of the other one. they're both the same. i don't know, shit. i don't remember it, but i was handling the camera -"
"dick gordon only tracked our side once, damn it. got us there."
how do you spell intrepid? i-n-t-r-e-p-i-d?
yes.
"that explains why that wheel was spinning. it was - probably had pulled out just a fraction of an inch right there and he didn't know it, and i reached up and grabbed it and looked at it. i could see ... working at it. 06 2309 16 cdr go, houston."
"yes, sir."
"okay. and don't forget to work up that same data for lalande for the rev before tei, there. 06 23 10 16 cml ... need that .... hey, try this."
okay.
i think we can all find lalande now ....
okay. now let me ask you another question .... film magazine.
not that i know of.
"i thought we had another ... - - 06 23 10 54 cml ... to the attitude, pete ...."
okay.
"yes, i think when i did it - remember when i said i didn't think it was rotating?"
yes.
"they've got both of them right there, probably."
you just didn't know it.
"what was that time on herschel, pete?"
"oh, time; i'm sorry."
"okay, houston."
"roger. 168:09:05, 168:33:57, 168:55:10."
go.
"roll, 1.1; 285.9; yaw, 1.6; roll, 1.4; 252.0; 2.0."
"roger. roi1, 1.1; pitch, 285.9; yaw, 1.6 for descartes. fra mauro: roll, 1.4, pitch, 252.0; yaw, 2.0."
okay .... into a 49?
huh?
...
did we do a p527
okay. we'll get that down to you in just a minute.
... he running?
"clipper, houston. we assume then that you did not do a p52 at about 165:50. over."
no.
"yes, i did."
"oh, excuse me."
"jerry, the torquing angles are plus zero decimal - okay, plus 0.023, minus 0.003, plus 0.073. torquing time 165:52:05."
"roger. time 165:52:05, and the angles are plus 0.023, minus 0.003, and plus 0.073."
okay.
285.9. you going to have a tough time making it?
"wait a minute, this isn't going to go."
why?
"you don't have a clock, there."
oh hell .... pick up one.
plus what?
"00110, plus 285 - no, no. plus 001 - no - plus 00160. got it. 06 23 20 39 cml yo ho!"
time is 167:20 - -
here we come up across the - -
we got 6 minutes.
- - our favorite spot.
what's that? herschel? 06 23 20 51 cml no -
theophilus?
"hey, jerry, those guys on those last two p22 points, i don't see anything different from the first ones, anyway."
"roger, dick. judging from the results on all the p22s you been sending down, buddy, you're the expert. 06 23 21 30 c_op we lucked out."
anything's simple with the best crew.
huh?
you're freaking it simple with the best crew.
you should have told them last july.
he's trained anyway.
you better believe it. we should have gone on november 14th; it was a better ...
"hey, jerry, tell kohrs also that on cp-2, he did pick that northern crater, and the one he's got in the - in the catalog is the centered one. but the coordinates he has is for - is for a northern one as he'll see in the film."
roger. that's the one you marked on. right?
"yes, just this last one. i marked on the - the one he has in the film, but the coordinates are actually for the northern crater.  day 8"
"why don't you wait a minute? what in the - world! i thought you guys tracked this rev - no, no, you're going to do the stereostrip this rev, huh?"
how can it do that?
...
you have to think that - you're not going to do ...
"yes, but we're on this rev right now. 07 00 09 14 imp ...?"
"yes. 168:09, so - i don't understand what happened."
...
i understand that.
..
but not for this rev.
..
"well, they just gave you these times for what?"
..
"then, you going to have to stop in the middle."
..
"well, yes."
.. coming through ...
good luck!
.. i see.
then what are we missing?
we don't go all the way through.
"on this rev. 07 00 10 05 imp oh, the rev ..."
"we're getting part of it, not all of it. they're only giving you - oh, i see, they're only giving you 16 minutes' worth."
right.
"... is somethingx oh, i know - i know - i know what it is. it's rev 44 that they give you all your updates on. 07 o0 10 33 sc rev 44...."
we're going around tailpipe up. we got three goddamn guys in here; one has to copy; you do that ... and i ...
who stole my pen?
i'm going to bring it back.
you stole mine.
... we ought to go around ...
"here it is, right here. uplink to - uplink to csm ... i don't understand this at all .... do a p52 on the back side, and we've done that; stereostrips here ... getting all lost; ... dse; update to csm; map update rev 45, tei 45 pad. ... looking right at them. they always ..."
"well, we're going to be doing lalande right there when they're doing all that anyway. why can't we do lalande - why can't we do this?"
... i've got the vector right here.
...

"roger. your lm gyro torque angles: x, minus 0004.5; y, minus 0003.5; z is minus 0009.2. over."
"roger. copied minus 0004.5, minus 0003.5, and minus 0009.2."
"affirmative. break. clipper, houston with a map update, rev 14."
that's a busy mother.
"okay. go, and i copied all the other."
"roger, dick. los 108:56:58 ---"
"my ears just cleared. man, that hurt."
- - 109:21:38; 109:43:04. over.
roger. 108:56:58; 109:21:38; 109:43:04.
... that camera over there.
affirm.
"what, pete?"
and i'm standing by for sep.
"did you set rd up, pete?"
"yes, sir. you verified the tracking lights?"
yes.
"i've gone to verb 76. you got all this? we're standing by for csm sep, right?"
how long before it? lo :onftden.nll da5y -
eleven minutes.
eleven minutes. okay. we got - we got a new tracking - -
huh?
we got a new altitude for tracking. the trouble is tracking; they raised the altitude - i think that's in hundreds of feet. they raised it 24 feet. i think it's 20 - - 240.
"yes_ let me look.o say, houston, this sim's running pretty smooth today."
"you'd never let me say that, babe. it looks like, because of your tracking, dick, they raised the landing site altitude about 2400 feet."
"that's not to believe, al. looked like it was in a hole to me."
"and, houston, i guess you saw the landing radar self-test. that came out 4.0."
"roger, pete. we copied that."
...... again.
right in the - -
"intrepid, houston. we'd like to get your valve on transmitter power on that."
"okay. wait 1. they were both 3.6. actually, isolated velocity xmitter was 3.62, and the altitude xmitter was 3.60."
roger.
i got to get that camera out here. got to get the camera out. i've got it in my hot hand. okay. what's the sep time?
sep time is 108:24:22. does that strike a memory blank anywhere? . fidenti a- -'
no. is that the time they actually passed?
that's the one you - that's the number you gave me. 04 i- 15 18 cdr okay.
is that the one they passed?
"houston, yankee clipper."
yes.
"go ahead, clipper."
"i'll go back to primary transponder, here, as soon as we separate .... hasn't helped a bit. looks like i lost the auto track feature in the high gain."
that's going to be a pain.
"roger, dick. we concur on that."
"ail right, dick. you're - we're still in secondary servo's there. you might go back to primary ones."
"ail right, conrad. you're stealing our ..., now."
okay. just trying to help out. kick that bag.
"if you'll recall, that's why we left it in the first place."
you keep your mike just ahead of me.
"if you both recall, that's why we left it in the first place."
yes. but it wasn't breaking lock then. you were - it's just getting intermittent signal strength.
what's it getting now?
that's right.
"only reason i'm beating you, jerry, is i'm 257 o00- some-odd miles closer to him than you are (laughter)."
"a good answer. now, look, try to keep him - you're going to track him anyway. try to keep him in my window and i'll take some shots of him."
just tell me where you want to go.
"okay, babe."
because i'm going to pitch to 247 as soon as he goes.
"okay. well, that's the same way. but i'm going to track him for 4 minutes, and it you'll just keep him over here and not let him get over in youm window."
okay.
"now, he's in a pretty good position."
it's on. it's running. it's running.
this isn't running.
the green light's on.
that doesn't mean it's running. it's a timer. it's timing this little package. it'll go out in a second. it times this little package to tell it what film it is and now - -
"ho, ho, ho."
"- - each of them has it - that little microswitch; if i release it and do it again, it'll do the same thing."
oh.
"now, i'll check it, though, because it might not work."
"now, look, i'm going to yaw back to the left."
okay.
"man, does that look hard and barren down there. ci o_fnide :t"
"you're doing right, pete. man, it's going to be little."
yes.
far away from it.
yes.
"i'll tell you one thing, i've been - a bad habit i've gotten into, and i'm having to be careful here, is i'm always grabbing this hand controller to - to talk. and i - i don't grab it; i just go like this, and i - oh god, and then i have to use this."
we got about 12 degrees to go.
"you can sure see those thrusters fire, can't you?"
yes.
"intrepid, houston."
go.
"roger, pete. the way things are looking right now, you're going to be starting pdi about - about 5 miles north of track; and, during the descent, you are going to be steering south."
"five miles north of track. okay. as long as it knows it, it's okay with me (laughter). my ears cleared up. i don't know why. it pisses me off. everything's as clear as a bell."
"clipper, houston. are you going to try those primary servo electronics?"
it's been tried. how's it looking?
looking good and solid now. 14 onf't -
that's right. the antenna's not moving around at all. it appears to be locked on tight.
"clipper, houston. are you in auto now?"
that's negative.
"forget it, dick, go back to manual."
"roger. we copy you're auto, dick. you're better off in manual."
"you still in auto, dick? it's just locked up solid, if it is."
"no, it's manual."
"oh, okay. sorry."
i can move around in here pretty good when i've got all this room.
"hey, the next time you're going to pitch or do something, let me know and i want to watch the thruster."
okay.
"tell me what you are going to do first, though."
i'm going to start to pitch down after a while.
"okay, when you do, i'll watch."
"why don't i just do a whole bunch of them, as soon as he goes?"
how's he getting above us like that?
i don't know. he's going to fire straight down.
i know it. i'm going to have to wait and catch him when he is low.
yes. n fidei%t
try to keep him - do what you can. i know you've got lots to do.
let's look over these systems.
"yes. it's looking good, pete."
wonder what we're going to do without our high gain? we'll have to go on omni's most of the way.
yes. they can do it. no sweat.
"this is one of the better visuals i've seen, dick."
"yes. you're right. i've been taking stills, and i let it get out of view of tv. i got to get you back."
i got you 1 minute and 40 seconds - -
mark.
- - to sep.
"clipper, houston. you're go for sep."
roger.
do you get the idea this thing rocks every once in a while?
"i haven't noticed it, but i haven't - if i don't - -"
"i know what it is. it's that antenna over there is driving me buggy, everytime that thing moves."
"intrepid, houston. give us a mark with 1 minute to go to sep, would you?"
it's already 1 minute. i'll give you one at 45 seconds.
mark.
forty-five seconds.
wonder why he wanted one. suppose we got the wrong time?
i don't know.
"that's the one you wrote down that he gave us, huh?"
yes.
okay. that's got to be it.
"you concur with that, yankee clipper?"
"i don't have average g yet, pete."
okay. i - i may have copied the time down wrong or something.
108:24:42.
okay; 42. i got 22. i had the nominal time.
average g.
very good. 04 12 24 1_ cmp i'll be watching you.
"okay. we'll be looking for you, too. okay. there he goes. he's burning."
"funny, i didn't - now, he's burning."
yes. there he goes; there he goes. look at that.
"intrepid, houston. you were off on that figure by 20 seconds. csm was right. 04 12 2_ 47 cdr yes. i had the wrong time. he's burning now, and he looks good out there."
burn's complete.
by-by. c
"see you, troops. 0_ 12 25 13 lmp let him get low, pete. i can't take his picture. he's way too high."
okay. why is he way too high_ i can see him in my window fine.
"he's way up at the top. i just - it won't be - let him get a little lower. besides, it isn't much of a movie, anyhow."
"clipper, houston. you can terminate average g, n ow."
it's done. it's done.
okay. we got a good updata link?
"okay, houston, we're in updata link for you any time you want to send us his state vector."
no. forget it.
"we'll be ready in about 3 minutes, pete."
"okay, in the meanwhile, i'm going to take the computer. give me a holler when you are ready. 0_ 12 26 00 lmp okay, now - i am going to start shooting him, now."
okay.
"this might not turn out because we're looking right at the sun. ok 12 26 07 cdr yes. 0_ 12 26 08 lmp get up here. maybe i can make it. that's a perfect place, pete. don't get it - don't let him get any higher in the window than that. let him get lower in the window."
i'm tracking him exactly. i don't want to waste gas.
"so, okay. okay. that's going to be a beautiful shot. because he's coming down below us. look at that."
"boy, do you look neat down there against the moon, dick."
got your pictures?
we're taking them. we're taking them.
okay. i need to set ordeal.
"god, that's going to be fantastic shot. 0h 12 27 33 lmp going to be a beautiful picture, pete. god, it's going to be beautiful."
"dick, you want to get your transponder on?"
okay.
"clipper, houston. try omni bravo."
they want omni bravo.
"hello, houston."
"boy, conrad, if that turns out, it's going to be so spectacular. don't let me get behind a power curve here."
"al, i think you've had enough."
you still have the tv on the omni?
"that's negative, clipper. 04 12 28 52 c_5 okay. i'll secure it."
supposed to shoot 1 more minute.
"clipper, houston. would you check your delta-vcg switch to csm?"
csm. thank you. nz..ta-l4
we're going to go over our landing site here someplace.
"intrepid, clipper going to duple b and ra2_ging."
"okay. we're not ready for you yet, but you go ahead there, and we'll come up - -"
right now. we'll do it.
okay. we're coming up now.
okay.
"how do you hear us now, dick? should be on hot mike."
"okay. loud and clear, but let me get - get locked on. don't talk to me for a minute."
...
bring up the cabin lights.
cabin lights coming up.
floods and all that good stuff.
okay. let me get this camera and stow it away.
okay.
"we're in att hold; verb 77. are you ready with that updata link, houston?"
"that's affirmative, pete. go to p00 and data."
you've got it. p00 and data.
"roger. intrepid, houston. we got another delay. it'll be another minute before we can start it up."
okay. i'll just skip down here. 04 12 31 01 l_ okay. do you want me to mark - want me to cross them off? nfiden -
huh?
you want to check those off?
where's the radar antenna?
let me look.
"intrepid, houston. it's on its way."
got to be in mode 2 or something. i got it. what was that?
"intrepid, houston. you ready for your data?"
yes. go ahead.
okay. it's on the way.
okay.
i got you 0.2 of a mile.
what the hell - oh. pitch.
"pete, i show you locked on with the radar."
i'm going to flip the ags to auto.
okay. i've got auto track.
"for some reason, we show a great deal out of plane."
"intrepid, houston. the computer is yours. break. clipper, houston. if you'll go p00 and accept, we've got your uplink."
okay. it's all yours.
"roger, clipper. it's on the way."
check your ags needle.
i did and they weren't even close.
iftde e j
"check them again. you haven't been updated, yet; that's why."
that's right. you still haven't been updated.
"okay. i hold you at 1.3 - no, excuse me, dick. i'm looking at the wrong register; 0.22 at about 3 feet per second. 04 12 3_ 20 cmp i've got it. i've got you at 0.2526 on the vf - vhf."
and the tapemeter looks good?
i need an update.
"ail right. i got - i got ahead, here."
okay.
"i had to. now, let me just get through this right."
okay.
"i also show you going a good ways out of plane to me for some reason. 0_ 12 34 51 cmp i've got the same thing myself. i don't understand it. coming - think i'm coming back a little, though."
okay. i've got him at 1500 feet. that's perfect. now - -
"23 - 23 minutes, 36 minutes, and 23."
everything agrees.
at the - - 0h 12 35 25 cdr okay.
"27. _7 would be 13, 13."
"now, you can check your ags needles in a minute."
"okay. onfiden"""
because i'll just point at him then.
okay. just a second.
"36; that'll mean that there's 24 minutes and another 23 would be 47 minutes, few minutes, 39."
let me know when you can give me a 47.
ail right. i can do it right now.
go ahead. throw.
"okay. now, let me go ahead and track dick."
"36, 36, that would be - -"
that's it. right there.
"37, 3 - -"
"now, can you check your ags needles real quick?"
i can if you can give me an update.
it's coming across.
okay.
we're ready to start this alighment right on time.
"i haven't gotten it yet. oh, it's got that long computer time."
yes.
why don't we start getting the lights down in here?
"well, the sun's shining right in the window, right at the moment. 04 12 37 37 l_,ip okay."
there it is. you should have it.
i've got her.
"okay. now, check your ags needles real quick. because i'm pointing just about out - - 0k 12 37 49 l_d okay. there - here they come. ok 12 37 51 cdr okay."
they're that far off. pretty far.
"oh, that's pretty sorry."
yes. but we're in close and you know the ags is not - -
okay.
- - any good there.
"okay. go ahead. now, bring up the lights. wow!"
how about some exterior lights for me?
okay. coming on.
are we supposed to?
give him the tracking light.
"pete, are we supposed to?"
do you have my lights?
sure do.
okay. your tracking light's on.
ail right. let me pro out of there. let's get the damn lights up where we can see.
yes.
"now. we need a 400 plus 3. age onfidei""i'tt-' 5"
all right. you get a.
"give me a verb 40 noun 20, please. now, i want to - i got to look at this p30, and then we're done. i did this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this."
how long we going to keep this vhf ranging on?
and that. ail done. okay. can i look at p307
my ags and pgns don't really line up too good. they're off in roll.
and let me have the do - -
"clipper, houston. computer's yours."
"let me have the doi pad. 04 12 39 27 _p in a line, 2, 3 -"
want to set this clock counting up to doi?
i think i did.
"yes. you're right. hope it is. i'll tell you what you never did. you never gave me a verb 83. if you ever can do it, it should be nice."
do you want to reset that clock? here's a verb - -
"no. 04 12 40 10 l_ ail right, verb 83."
"enter, and that clock's not right."
come on. we got to get going. we're late.
"no, no, we're not. here's 20 right here, and we're only 17 here."
we're just right.
"come on, 83, you - - cj) fide t4-, 04 12 40 47 _p it takes a long time."
i know it. 0_ 12 40 50 lmp it's right on.
i've got you at 4.7 miles.
"okay. i've secured mine, dick."
okay.
there it is. my verb 83 shows you 4.7 at 3-1/2 feet a second.
okay.
"boy, mine's different than yours."
"well, we better update it again."
that's what i think.
are you in - -
let's do it again.
go.
"now, wait a minute. i want to get this clock running right here. this is not right."
okay.
it's off by 1 second.
"if i just hold it for 1 second, it ought to be right, huh?"
yes.
"stop, start. ail right. 04 12 42 09 _p it's okay."
"ail right. pro? no, wait a minute; i've got to go to p40. let me get it done. conftt n t ' day"
okay.
"okay. hou - houston, i'm going to p40 for you to look at it."
"roger, pete. stand by."
"holy christ, are those the right angles?"
"intrepid, houston. we're copying your p40."
"okay. can i go? oh, add 180, that's right. okay?"
roger. go.
"add 180, ... to this."
"well, that thing's, that - -"
that's roll.
okay.
so add 180 to - -
okay.
"that. okay. ail right, now. verb 47."
okay.
"god, this takes long. hey, i'm going to yaw as soon as i get done doing that. dick, i'm going to start my yaw maneuver in a minute and go ahead."
okay.
yaw right to 98.
"how's the high gain going to do? stay locked on, i guess?"
"let me check it. hey, your book's floating up."
"okay. come hack, book. 04 12 4_ 00 l_ supposed to. seems to be."
"god damn, we ought to have this alignment done. 04 12 44 17 l_ heck, pete, we're not even supposed to he there, yet. 04 12 4_ 20 cdr i know. i just want to stay ahead."
"shit, you make me think we're behind all the time. 04 12 4_ 24 cdr got to hustle, boy."
"shucks, we've just got to do this."
okay. you've got your update in.
okay.
"let's don't bother checking it. 04 12 4_ 36 lmp let me ask houston about the ags and pgns; see how they think. houston, intrepid, how do you think the ags and pgns compare? let them figure that on one out."
stand by 1 second.
flood - -
vhf antenna to aft. you're going to have to pull that floodbreaker.
"that's what i'm going to do, right now."
okay.
vhf antenna is aft.
okay.
"just a minute now. you usually use your flashlight, remember?"
"yes. ail right. now. 04 12 k5 24 cc intrepid, houston. your pgns and ags look real good. 28 (j'onfii)h tia 5"

"no, why?"
i didn't know if - because you will be down in here for this perilune. i don't think it's - -
i didn't need it for the other.
i know it. i know. i just didn't know if you were yet. what a machine. what a machine!
"that's it, pal. you're in a doi attitude, 01090. 04 13 30 25 _p target pgns for pdi plus 12 abort."
"okay, here you go. shoot it to me."
"stay loose and i will. need some time's, i bet."

"roger. i got 60.5 by 8.9, dick. very good. are you tracking me in the sextant?"
... not yet. i've just got that 76 up.
"oh, okay. i'm in the pdi attitude at this time. how much fuel have i got left?"
"you're so good, it's fantastic. what are you talking about?"
that's got to be - that's got to be all volcanic down there.
"okay. 146, that's good. 13, that's good enough. forget it. we ain't doing that one."
"lets hope not. okay. what's next? doi postburn report; helmets and gloves on; cabin repress, close; suit gas diverter, egress."
"pete, you ought to move this, because i was look- ing; that thing could fall off there and hit your dsky now. you ought to put somewhere else."
"well, you can take it and put it away for all i give a shit right now."
"well, that's complicated."
... you're moving across that surface.
look at that. look at that thing.
"yes, i can tell we're going down, too."
"look at that thing. put it in - put it over in there, pete, in one of those bags, urine bag or something like that. we'll get it later."
"guess when you get down to it, i ought to do that same thing to mine. 58 il confidentiatl 5"
"no, let's don't_ too much trouble."
"why? why? grab it right down - - 0_ 13 33 29 cdr - - something else that i've got to do right now, too."
"okay. i can grab them like this. okay. okay, now. have you got clock counting up or down or something?"
"no, i'm not counting any which way. we ought to get - what was the pdi time?"
"pdi time. let me give it to you, babe. 110:20:37."
1101 -
20
"110:20 - - 04 13 33 55 l_ so that's 20 minutes plus - just a minute. it's going to be 35 in a minute. so, that would be 25 and 20. 45. put 45 in there. no, no, no, no. i goofed it. put 15 in there. we want it count- ing up. i goofed. thatts it. now i'll tell you when. not - no, no. the time has got to get to 35 something, so it's got to get to $5:37. so i'll watch it. okay?"
yes. i need another shot $f cold.
"okay. i'd like a shot of cold water, but that's out of the picture. there's a little. it's liable to come in too strong, babe. let me look at this suit crit. 0_ 13 34 42 cdr when do we - when do we get acquisition? ,confidentialj"
we get it right here.
"109:43, huh?"
9 minutes.
"okay. man, dick. we're in the pdi attitude, which is heads down going forwards right now. and it looks like we're just making a big dive into the lunar surface."
i understand. i got you.
did you see that engine burn?
yes.
ail the pressures good and everything?
yes. 35. just a second. i'm going to get it - -
and i got to put that to auto right now.

before i forget it.
that's a smart idea.
anything else i got to do? 04 13 35 24 lm? ...
"ail those pressures okay. super crit. take a look at them. ambient, 450."
...
"okay. you like the way it looks, old shoe?"
"yes, sir."
i may as well go get the mode 2.

"get on the time line. 6o confidential"" sa5y"
you got the clock counting up? 45 minutes from - 35 minutes is 25 is - no. what time did you say the time was? pdi? 110:20. you're going to have to fold that over and lift it up by the camera - by the camera and in. now hold -

yes. let me have it. i'll get rid of it for you.
hold this - hold this end.
"oh boy, we really do use descent water, though. we're down to 85 percent right now."
i got to get up a little higher.
okay.

okay.
"we won't - we have to get those out to use them at night anyway, pete. we'll move them. okay, now, what have we got?"
at night?
sequence camera. i've got that son of a gun set so good it stinks. if i can just start it now at the ... moment.
"hey, hey - why don't you go ahead and button us up? cabin repress, close?"
"the thing will blow you down a bit, but that's okay. cabin repress, close. now what? egress?"
"suit gas diverter, egress."
"suit gas diverter, egress. okay."
"cabin gas return, egress."

"as a matter of fact, we ought to see them come up ov - o - o in front of us."
"yes. now watch this, pete. 62 _age ui iriu:n/ial day5"
what? you got that in.
"yes, sir. okay. we're standing by to do that. hey, what's our pitch attitude?"
109.
109. it's about il and minus 2.
that's what i've got. i'm watching for them to come up on the - on the horizon and see earthrise.
wish i could shoot that shot. it'd be - live for- ever in the annals of our own personal goodwill. coming up for pdi.
... got anything tight right here?
no.
we'd do that and become famous for this. o_ 13 40 25 lmp 250.
just a minute ....
could make us both famous right here.
"i didn't write down the aos plan, did you?"
"you wrote it down, pete. you wrote it down on that other page. but, hell, what difference does it make? it's right - in a minute. we're going to see them come up."
43:30.
"can you hear us, dick?"
yes. i can hear you.
you know. it doesn't look any closer to me down here than it does at 60 miles. i frankly can't tell the difference.
may not be closer to you. c_ dnfidentialt.
"maybe that's it. heck, i don't know."
i don't imagine we've come down more than 5 or 6 miles.
i'll look at it right now. the ags thinks we're at 50 - 50 miles.
yes.
"the ags thinks we're 50 miles, dick."
"if we take this picture it'll be famous forever; even better than when we grab the surveyor by all of its parts, dismantling it handily."
is everything tucked away? anything going to fall on our heads?
going to have to go to inverter 1 some day. did you check off those good things i did?
s-band antenna is forward. right?
check off the good things i did. you did. we did.
"ail right. coas is to the overhead window; d0i postburn report we'll get; helmets and gloves are on; cabin repress is closed; suit gas diverter to egress; egress; cabin reg's a and b, egress: and we're standing by for the updata link switch. we're going to get earthrise in just a second. you ought to have earthrise by now, dick."
... be a while yet because i'm looking backwards.
"oh, that's right. i forgot."
"it's going to be at 109:43:30. it's going to be right straight out there or what, i wonder? i'm kind of guessing it is."
"or maybe, would it - -"
yes. p ge onfidential .... 04 13 _3 04 l_ - - maybe the 15-degree inclination's going to do something to it. i just always imagined it was right in front of us.
15 more seconds. there - no. i thought i saw it coming up. 9 - 30 seconds.
starting - -
"there it is! look at it! goldarn! watch it - just - keep - just click them off. oh, that is fantastic!"
"hello, houston; clipper."
"give them high gain, al."
"they haven't got us yet, pete."
"oh, okay."
but i'll go over on it and we'll make it - -
roger. good burn. good burn.
you can get some more pictures if you want.
i'm getting them right now.
god dog!
"tell them about it, babe. 04 13 44 19 h_p f:ll, 250 is what we've been using, isn't it, pete?"
"yes, yes. 04 13 44 24 l_ that's got to be so fantastic."
"hello, houston; intrepid."
"intrepid, houston. how do you read? 04 13 _4 33 cdr roger. we read you loud and clear, and we just watched our first earthrise, which was fantastic! and we had a great doi burn. the x residual was zero; y was plus 0.2; and z was minus 0.6. j;onfidenti"
"roger, pete. copy your residuals. x is zero_ y, plus 2 - 0.2; and z, minus 0.6."
that's charlie.
"intrepid, houston. what were your ags residuals? over."
coming at you; 1 second.
"ags residuals were plus 0.3, plus 0.1, and minus 0.6."
"roger, al. intrepid, houston. we have your steerable now. could you give us high bit rate? 0b 13 45 48 cdr roger. going to high bit rate. 0b 13 45 51 lmp what else do we need to give him? biomed?"
"biomed, right; pcm, high; and updata link switch to data whenever they're ready."
"adios, babe. going to put this away."
okay.
time to get down to business.
yes.
don't lose that picture. that's going to be one that's going to hang around for years. i don't give a shit if it's - streaked.
"okay, i'm going to go ahead and get my - no, i'll wait - until i get the computer."
"hey, i didn't give them data."
"no, they - they didn't ask for it yet. 04 13 46 43 lm? oh, man, you scared me."
"and, houston, whenever you're ready, we're ready to give you p00 and data. age66 c dnfident ia:lw"
where's my pen?
"roger, intrepid."
"see a pen floating around here anywhere, pete?"
sure don't.
"i got it. i got two of them (laughter). okay, hang in there, babe. hang in there. pcm, high; biomed, right. set sequence camera. i did. that's all done."
helmets and gloves on; cabin repress is closed. and we're right here.
yes. but i got to get the updata link first. can't go on without that.
"i know it. vhf antenna, forward. it is. select inverter 1. wait - wait - don't select inverter 1 yet, pete. have you got your inverter 1 circuit breaker off?"
i sure do.
"coming over to ac and i'm going to inverter 1. i've got it. okay. see that guard? that's a - that's a bad one, boy. you could flip that out so easy. i've been worried about that one for months."
"okay, let's get the aeld's closed and abort stages closed. 04 13 _8 23 lmp i don't think we ought to do that. cycle the cwea."
"aeld, abort stage."
here comes the cwea cycle.
i never used the stop button. the window bars are set.
"intrepid, houston. would you put your biomed switch left? confidenti - _"
"okay, going biomed, left."
had a feeling they were going to want that.
"how soon before you're going to send up the data, houston? 04 13 49 13 lm? throttle, min."
min.
"about 1 minute, pete."
"okay, i'll hold then. we're standing right by to do the mode 2 lockon to radar and so we're holding."
"okay. break. yankee clipper, houston. i've got a re_v 15 map update for you."
roger. go ahead.
roger. los 110:55: - -

what?

yes. that's where i'm holding right now. i don't want to use the computer. i'm waiting for them to uplink. they should have uplinked.
- - 41:32. over.
roger. copy.
"in 5 minutes, you got to put on the bat's."
okay. let's see if this 30 minutes works out.
yes.
you tell me what time 30 minutes more is. and i'll tell you if that's right.
50:37. it'll be 20:37. age68 zonfiden.t' al
"that's right, babe."
"intrepid, houston. go po0 and data. we're ready to go."
we got it; poo and data for you. go ahead.
roger. it's on the way.
"hang it in there, pete, babe. hang in there."
"you're about 30 degrees above our horizon now, houston. and you're about one-third-cresent moon, and you really are beautiful. see blues and whites."
"roger, al. put on our sunday best for you."
we're pretty well suited out up here ourselves (laughter).
"boy, this thing sure flies nice."
"hey, does it still look like we're 5 miles north?"
"intrepid, houston. affirmative. you're still looking 5 north."
"okay. what kind of an azimuth with respect to the sun will i have on that - is it that little that i'm not going to notice it? 04 13 52 41 _p you're cutting in and out slightly_ pete. 04 13 52 56 _ just like you landed anytime on earth, pete."
"stand by, pete. we're checking with the experts."
okay. cgnfiden1'!.a
i'm not kidding.
what?
"the closer i get, the more i feel like it's just like landing on earth. just let it fly down and park it somewhere. we'll bound out and grab a rock."
okay.
let me read the pdi rules to you.
okay.
"no ullage, no-go for pdi."
yes.
"no ignition, delay 5 seconds; then set descent engine override, on. thruster rate; okay, 5 degrees ...."
"intrepid, houston. the computer's yours."
"very good. when i went to voice backup, it whistles. 04 13 54 13 i_p houston, intrepid. when i went my updata link to voice backup, it made a whistle on our comm, so i'm just going to leave it off."
"roger, al."
"keep reading. 04 13 54 32 _mp what can i do to help you, pete? let me cross them off for you."
okay.

"coming at you with the radar, dick."
roger.
okay. okay.
"intrepid, houston. that whistle you heard, we think, was because we were still commanding. they'd like to have you try it again."
just tried it - looks good. i'm in voice backup then. coming on with those bat's.
yes.
5 and 6_ pete.
yes.
ascent bat's coming on.
"roger, intrepid."
and we got a mode 2 lock.
"okay, i'm ready to - ready for an altitude check as soon as you can give it to me."
"okay. you got 36 minutes? i,confidenti"
you said it.
"your chart goes that low, huh?"
"hell, yes."

"okay. 37 it is. 04 13 56 57 imp what's it going to be, roughly?"
"looks like it's going to be around 290 to 295, something like that. sound about right? 04 13 57 08 imp 295 would put us about 56 thou."
it's going - it's going to be - it's not going to be that high.
"maybe that's that type where you can't - don't bother .... do it. just screw it, who cares."
yes.
i don't think that's worth a damn anyhow. okay. give me a 37 one.
293. 04 13 57 48 imp give me one at every minute.
"yes. age confidenttai 5 04 13 57 58 ia_p houston, our first perilune altitude check, using the tapemeter, shows that it's going to be about 57500."

second check shows it to be 59 000 feet.
"roger, al. clipper, houston. we think it probably won't do you much good to have it right now. it'd be better later."
okay. 04 13 59 08 _mp clipper and houston are clearing good.
"man, this suit is too tight."
"no, that's funny; you're going to love it. you're going to be like a bunny rabbit. just slow you down. t confidenti 04 13 59 25 i_p by-by, earth. s-band antenna better be grabbing that baby."
okay. stand by.
hang on there. okay.
"intrepid, houston. we're still looking at a perilune of 50 000."
mark.
320. okay.
320 shows that? something's screwy. something's wrong. our third one shows it's going to be 64 000. it's - just making kind of a sweep up. might be this tapemeter problem we saw on our self- check.
roger.
"so i got to go verb 37, enter; 63, enter."
okay. that's what you're doing?
yes.
we don't - we don't need to do any of those things. damn bit of difference.
"no, i'm going to kill it right now."
i'm game; kill it.

hum.
what's that whistling anyhow? what is that?
i don't know.
hope your pulse is lower than mine.
it's not too bad right at the moment.
"we look real good up here, houston. how you feeling down there?"
"intrepid, houston. we're feeling great."
"intrepid, houston."
go ahead.
"roger, pete. on this sun angle, or sun azimuth - as far as we can see, there'll be no noticeable difference as far as you're concerned. ail you got to do is watch out and not fly through any clouds. 0_ 1_ 05 12 cdr okay. i'll stay away from the clouds, and we're looking for the snowman."
roger.
"45 minutes, perilune altitude checks, rendezvous radar, cb, for the 99th time, they're both open (laughter). onfidenttal"
okay. touch_.
"the switch is in slew. 04 14 05 47 l_ p63. 0b 14 05 49 cdr put your program alarm card out here and your - slip that under your thing so you can honk that baby out, if we need it. okay?"

that's right; you can't land if you don't get down there amongst them.
"that's all right. look at that. i thought it was rela - this must be fra mauro we're going over. 0b 14 08 32 lmp can't tell, pete."
"say, houston; where are we? over fra mauro? iconfideniiai?"
"stand by, pete. we're looking at lines right now; we don't have our map up."
okay.
i don't want to look.
(laughter) there's nothing but rocks out there.
"i hope we go a lot further on. 04 14 09 21 _p we do; we got a long ways to go. got a - hundreds of miles after pdi, for christ's sake. already, we have 170 by 260 something - -"
"260, yes. 04 14 09 47 _ 49, pete."
"okay. we've done th_s so many times, we'd better do it right. don't let it get out of sight, don't get low, and don't try to fly too hard. i'd like to fly it there on lpd."
that's what i mean. this baby can save gas for us.
"i'll try to talk about as much as i do in the doggone simulator. if it looks like the gas is good, i'll say it; if it looks like we're too high or something, i'll say it, but i don't - -"
"intrepid, houston. you've probably just passed over theophilus."
okay. pretty darn***there.
roger. tell us when you want us to turn on the mirror.
"you can turn the mirror on; give me the fox-clipping, and we got the hook down."
roger.
"roger. fox-clipping, 285. clear the deck. hge78 confiden$ial day"
"interestingly enough, houston, at this attitude, i still can see the lunar horizon. i have to really peer to find it, but i can see it."
"roger, pete."
"and in 40 seconds, we'll be going to p63."
roger.
"how about the ags to auto, al?"
"not yet, not yet."
okay.
7 minutes to 37?
not yet.
let me trim it up.

good godfrey. that - that handle's in there like something i never saw before.
how's the lock joint? is it easy to get - was it easy to get the lock out?
yes. now that's better. i couldn't even get the handle out of the deal. i just pulled the table releases down.
okay.
there you go.
"you haven't got anything to do, so you can take this with you."
"hey, i'll tell you what we're parked next to."
what?
we're about 25 feet in front of the surveyor crater. 04 19 18 41 i24p that's good. that's where we wanted to he.
"i got - i bet you when i get down to the bottom of the ladder, i can see the surveyor."
"roger. here you are. you want to take this with you, pete?"
just swing her out here.
"sounds good, pete. just like you wanted."
that's right.
"okay; now hold it there just a second, pete. 120"
okay.
one second.
"do you have any tv, houston?"
roger. we've got a tv.
how's the color?
no pete conrad as yet.
"i'm at the top of the ladder. okay. now look, this thing is all the way out of the package. how do you want me to do it? this way?"
just keep going.
huh?
adigs.
"no, but this thing isn't all the way out of the - ... here, let me have this end of it. let me come hack up the ladder a notch."

that a boy. which end is that? ***do i want? this is the end i want.
there you go.
there we go (laughter). look at that stuff go.
"sure glides at one-sixth, doesn't it?"
yes. *** looks - looks like we got 900 feet of this stuff.
"hey - okay, just a second. don't go down yet. i've got to get my camera on you, babe."
"i can't go down yet, anyhow. i got to - whoops - get the lec all the way down."
okay. nfjd.enti
there you go.
ail right. sure can't figure out what kind of a snarl i've got here.
"hey, al."
yes.
can you look - can you look out your window?
sure.
ail right. i think i see what's wrong.
what's the problem?
"oh, that lec came out of the bag in three pieces, and, as you would well imagine, i picked the wrong piece."
do you want me to pull it back in and throw you the end?
no. that's not the problem.
okay. it's no trouble.
"i got it right now. man, they aren't kidding when they say things get dusty. whew! i'm headed do_ the ladder."
"okay, wait. let me get the old camera on you, babe."
okay.
"man, is that a pretty-looking sight, that lm."
"you're coming into the picture now, pete."
okay.
okay; got the old camera running.
okay. down to the - the pad.
okay.
"whoopie! man, that may have been a small one for neil, but that's a long one for me. i'm going to step off the pad."
mark.
"off the - ooo, is that soft and queasy. hey, that's neat. i don't sink in too far. i'll try a little - boy, that sun's bright. that's just like somebody - shining a spotlight on your hand."
"well, i can walk pretty well, al, but i've got to take it easy and watch what i'm doing. boy, you'll never believe it. guess what i see sitting on the side of the crater. 04 19 23 25 lmi the old surveyor, huh? 04 19 a3 26 cdr the old surveyor; yes, sir (laughter). does that look neat! it can't be any further than 600 feet from here. how about that?"
"okay. let me see. i've got a little chore to do here, right?"
"well planned, pete."
say again.
"i say that was well planned, pete."
"yes. just a couple of months with a lot of people. let's see, deploy the lec and the mesa - that's done. i'm looking at my mobility, eg shift. i have the decided impression i don't want to move too rapidly, but i can walk quite well. that cra - the surveyor really is sitting on the side of a steep slope, i'll tell you that. okay. now, i'll work on my contingency sa_nple. got to walk real careful, al."
okay.
can you see me all right?
not yet. i need you ... back of the window for c nfidentiaiiml
okay. 04 19 2_ 40 lmp - - check. 0_19 24 41 cdr ... move in a hurry.
"as you might suspect from some of the pictures neil brought back, gang, i have a - several small rocks sitting out in front of me that have a neat amount of dirt built up around them. i'm not sure that my descent engine didn't blow them there. but then again, it may not have. i have the contingency sample - -"
"roger, pete. copy that. is the dirt built up on the side closest to the lm?"
"well, let me - i'm going over to get my contin- gency sample, and i'll get one of the rocks - in the sample. and yes, as a matter of fact, it is built up on the side that - that the lm landed on. let me get it. well, there's one scoop. there's another with some more rocks in it. wheel this dirt's just like the one-sixth g airplane, al. flies up in the air, and you can just chase it around. boy, now, i'll tell you - you know, this sun, it - it really is - it's just somebody's got a - a superbright spotlight. here's another good looking rock. whoops! in the sample. there's another rock i want to get in it."
"i think that's about enough, don't you? except there's one - one big rock that's too pretty to pass up. no, i ... not be a hog. it won't fit. i'll go over here and get this other one, though."
"boy, you sure lean forward, pete."
***i lean forward; i feel like i'm going to fall over in any direction.
you're leaning about - -
"say, houston, one of the first things that i can see, by golly, is little glass beads. i got a piece about a quarter of an inch in sight, and i'm going to put it in the contingency sample bag, if i can get it. i got it. am i really leaning over, al?"
"you sure are. you - on earth, you'd fall over, i believe."
huh?
"on earth, you'd fall over leaning that far forward."
"but - it seems a little weird, i'll tell you. it's - don't think you're going to steam around here quite as fast as you thought you were."
"***tell you, your boots are digging in the soil quite a bit. if you don't pick up your feet, you really kick a - a load of dirt ahead of you. your left foot's got a big mound ahead of it right now that it's just pushing along."
"uh-oh, do i hear a tone? 04 19 28 21 i24p yes. i've got an h20 a."
you do?
"yes. i wonder why? hey, houston."
"al, verify feedwater's on."
ish.
it's been on. it's still on.
"boy, do i sink in. wow!"
feedwater's on and it's still real cool in here.
"al, diverter valve to minimum."
okay. it's minimum now. what do you think i may have done? broken through the sublimator or something?
"that's affirmative, al. confidenti.! ij"
"we have a good shot of you there, pete"
"okay. well, i'm starting to - take this baby apart. while i am doing that - houston."
that descent engine! it's just like neil's.
go ahead.
"i didn't dig any crater at all. al, you've really got to watch your step down here."
okay.
"look at all those good things in this mesa. things that i've seen before. didn't hardly stroke the gear at all, and it looked like we were - looks like i landed just about vertical."
"just like neil and buzz said, al. you get on a little slope and you tend to keep on going."
... fell over.
would you believe it - the mesa is too low for once?'
"al, how does the feedwater look now?"
"well, it's still got an a in there, but i'm plenty cool; i went back to minimum, and i'm sitting here in minimum. what do you think happened? 0h 19 32 04 cc al, we would like to watch it a little bit. it could be instrumentation. stand by."
okay.
"(humming) how long have i been out, houston?"
"pete, you've been out 25 minutes, and you're about 4 minutes ahead."
"okay. i got the table out, ... the mesa, and i'm setting up etb at this time. let's see. how is this packed? very nice. very nice. pa e i 'onfidential '"
"hey, al, ... work out here all day. just take your time."

"all right. no, that's not right. ***i think our next big surprise, al, is getting this thing up."
getting what up?
the etb.
"oh, is that right?"
(laughter) we'll see what happens. okay? how's your water?
"oh, it still shows an a, but it's cool. it may be instrumentation."
let's hope so. just beginning to warm up to this task.
"lcg water pump sounds like a diesel truck running out here. comforting to know that it's running. i'm off to get the battery. 04 19 35 09 ip5 okay. i think i know what happened, houston. i think i know what happened."
ahhh!
"pete, go ahead."
"what did - what did you just do, al?"
"man, i just figured it out."
you sure did. you just blew water out the front of the cabin. onfidentia · 04 19 35 34 l_ thatts what - -
ice crystals.
- - that's what had happened to the plss.
what's that?
"oh, the door had swung shut, like it did before; and it probably bothered the sublimator, because it wasn't in a good vacuum anymore."
"yes. 04 19 35 48 _p so, i opened the door, and it's probably going to start working in a minute."
"(laughter) i should hope so. when you opened the door, that thing shot iceballs (laughter) straight out the hatch."
"yes. and there's probably - all from my - never thought you'd have to do that. hey, you bent the outside of that front hatch on the way out. you tore some of the skin."
how did i do that?
i don't know; must have hit your plss there. got a nice scrape mark right along the way out.
sorry about that .... got to be gentle.
houston - -
"al, it's looking better."
"yes, i - i didn't realize that the hatch could close quite so tightly like that. it was just - when i was working on the other side of the cabin, the hatch went closed and i didn't notice it, and apparently the - it quit holding a good vacuum in here. my h20 a flag is off now, so everything is copacetic."
"roger, al. it looks good down here. pag1e28 cij)nfidenti_ i 5"
okay.
"okay. i've got both canisters, al, both bat- teries. as soon as i get them in here, i got to pack the contingency sample."

"okay. man, did i get dirt all over myself. this is what is known as dirt's dirt."
"let me know when you start heading back out there to duty, pete - pete - pete. i'll get a good shot of you, babe."
"getting ready to do it in just a second, al, just as soon as i get the bag. i got the contingency sample in the bag. 04 19 38 52 lmi okay."

okay.
"ail right, lec, possible tv deploy, lmp egress, contingency sample area. deploy color chart and place 70 millimeter on the mesa. so i get me a camera."
"okay, be out in a minute. got to set the camera, and i'll be right out."
ail right. let me know so ! can photograph you.
okay.

"pete, for your information for those photos, your shadow lines right now is about 45 feet on a level plane."
"okay, very good. contingency sample area i got; deploy the color chart (laughter). take your time, al."
okay. i'm ready to do it.
houston. how does the lm look? i'm getting ready to move out the front door.
roger. i'll stand by on that.
"dum de dumdum. whoops. hey, wait, i'm going to - i wonder if i can get in the bottom of this crater hole."
"al, houston. the lm is looking good. you're go for egress. 04 19 48 h8 lmp okay."
"pete, you're at 40 minutes into the time line, and you're about 4 minutes ahead."
okay .... (laughter) oh dear.
"okay, pete, here i come."

"*** 0_ 19 50 49 lmp oh, it's kind of hard to move the door. i was just getting in and trying to get it."
there you go. 04 19 50 57 _ i'm going to try to keep the door open for us there.
"okay. o_ 19 51 10 lmp pretty good, i'd better get my visor down though."
"yes, sir. my, that sun is bright."
"well, the lm looks nice on the outside. iconfidential 5"
"houston, let me ask you a question. how important is that color chart? i tried to spike it in the ground, you know, so it was perpendicular to the sun, and it just didn't do that, and it's all covered with dirt. i can go back and resalvage it, if you want to take the time. okay, you're on the last step there."
"press on with what you're doing there, pete, and we'll get a answer back to you."
okay. okay. turn around and give me a big smile.
"pete, press on. no problem."
okay. that a boy. 04 19 51 58 _ okay?
"you look great. welcome aboard. good place - wait a minute - the chart i didn't get, deploy color chart on undisturbed surface. didn't make it. contingency sample area i got, and lmp egress i got. i'm off for s-band antenna."
"okay. my, but that sun is bright."
"yes, take it easy."
it feels good.
"yes, you really do begin to adapt. you hop a little bit. if you turn around and walk over to your right a little bit and look over that crater, you're going to see our pal sitting there, and that's one steep slope it's on. okay, now what have you got all over your boot? stop. you picked up a piece of landing gear ...."
okay. there you go.
that a boy. confidenti
"okay, i'm going into - 04 19 5? 50 lm_ hey, you've got to watch it in these c_dows."
yes. you can't see what you're doing. come over here where i am. see that surveyor sitting there?
_nere that thing is. look at that.
will you look how close we almost landed to that crater!
"beautiful, pete."
look at the descent engine. it didn't even dig a hole. okay.
"houston, i'm need to process - -"
"pete, houston."
"go ahead, houston."
"hey, al?"
yes?
i got to save this paper. would you get - -
"pete, will you give us status the - on the lm and also some comments on your boot penetration?"
"okay. my comment's are exactly the same as neil's. in fact, everytime i get down in one of these little craters_ i sink in a lot further. i'd say our footsteps are sinking in -"
what do you want to do with it?
"put it over by that y-gear. i think i cover that rock box with itlater. remember, last minute change. and - pag1e36 tonfident'i/"
"hey, wait a minute. you want ...?"
"oh, ... i think it's pretty much the same as neil and buzz found, don't you, al?"
"i do. one thing i've noticed; it seems to compact into a very shiny surface. i guess the particles are very small and very cohesive, so when you - every bootprint, as you look at it, it looks almost like getting a piece of rubber itself. it's so well defined, and you can't see any grains in it or anything."
"al, can you find - can you find the earth?"
where's the earth?
"oh, there it is; i can see it. hello there, earth. 04 19 54 31 _p 'where is it?"
just look at the s-band antenna and look up that way; it's right up there.
i'll have to back up a little.
"okay. now - where did we all agree was the best place to deploy this s-band? ... the y-gear, huh?"
yes. a little bit further out.
"that ought to - here's a good spot. hey, i don't want to get too far away from the cable."
what's the - what's the matter with right here?
that's a good place.
okay.

"that's what it says. confident,"

"right - glass, in these rocks."
"yes, i reported that."
"you can also see some pure glass, if you look around. you can jump up in the air. 04 19 55 2_ cdr hustle, boy, hustle. we got a lot of work to do. i've got to do my pan's in 15 - 5 minutes here."
"okay. i'm doing some useful work, like getting that tv camera going."
"okay, good idea."
you really got to be careful when you go out of the light into the dark.
yes. okay.
okay. move position 20 feet and 10.
"hey, i got a - this second thing won't come out. hey, give me a hand here. 04 19 56 07 _ yes, sir; what can i do for you?"
"this second s-band thing won't deploy. 04 19 56 11 lm2_ well, do you want me to pull or hold?"
on this?
yes. on this. pull. pull away from me.

"no - i don't think it's - let go, let go."
try a different -
i got it; never mind.
"that's not right, is it? doesn't that thing have two sections to it?"
"no, never mind; forget it; let's go."
"hey, houston. does the inner mast - it's just one piece, huh? 04 9 56 50 cc copy the question. you want to know if the inner mast is one or two sections."
"yes. it seems to me - i'm getting dumb-dumb, maybe. it looks shorter than it used to look in practice for some reason. i thought there was more than one section - -"
"pete, that inner mast should be two sections."
- - i think so; you have to pull out this. the top side ... in the inside.
move this tv over - cable over here by the front porch.
okay. do you know - - 04 19 57 2 lmp the tv is almost off.
"- - you know, it is significantly easier just to do anything here. just like this arm motion is so simple because you're not fighting the rest of your weight like you are there in one g."

"okay, let's get that tv out and show e _rybody. wait a minute. lock inner mast; lock cuter mast; extend and lock brakes - we've done; s_gn; remove thermal cover. okay? we want thermal cover."
goodby.
"okay, houston, i'm going to move the tv camera now."
"roger, al."
"hey, it's real nice moving around up here. you don't seem to get tired. you really hop like a bunny. where, oh where is earth? there it is. here is the tv. and let me set this - pointing toward the sun. that's bad. point it here a minute. dum de duradum dam dam dmn."
"there's that. look at that go (laughter). 04 19 59 24 i_ hey, red, i was going to deploy this 20 feet and 10; but, because of the sun being where it is, we're going to have to deploy it a little bit more toward the 2 o'clock position. i think that will be okay though. that will give you a good shot; right in here. i'll see if i can keep the sun from getting in the camera at all. i'll have to move it ... hey, am i - -"
"al, we have a pretty bright image on the tv; could you either move or stop it down?"
"okay, i'm going to have to stop it down. that's as far as it goes, houston. how does that look to you?"
"no, it's still - still looks the same, al. why don't you try shifting the scene?"
"okay, i'm going - the problem is the lm is very reflective. let me - i got two choices. let me go over here further to the side, and you check and see if it reflects too much; and if it does, i'll have to go stick it in the shade. and then maybe shine past the lm; of course, that makes it not be too good either, but it may be the best we can do. see how this looks to you, houston. pag1e40 confident day j"
"okay, al. and also, you might t_ r the automatic light control to the outside."
"okay, al, watch. 04 20 00 59 _ wait a sec. let me go - -"
i got - -
"how does that look, houston?"
"still looks the same, al."
"(laughter) man, oh man, did that thing deploy! (laughter)"
"well, i'll tell you what let me do, houston. let me move it around here back, so the back is to the s-_n, and maybe that'll help. maybe that's the way we're going to have to do it."
"okay, al; go ahead."
"once we learn the trick here, i think we can do it each time. that may do it; that may do it, right there, houston."
"al, we haven't seen any change at all. why don't you go and take and put your glove in front of the lens, but not over it, to see whether we can get any change at all."
what do you see now?
"still the same, al. we've got a very bright part - about 20 percent of the top, and black on the bottom. 04 20 02 13 lm_ well, got any suggestions? i'm pointing it in a nonbright area. let me point it - -"
"stand by, al."
i - got it pointed away from the sun here. it may be ground problems. i hope it is. ail the con- nections look good. confidenti
"hey, al, why don't you take a good close look at the lens and make sure it's in the rigz_t cont_gura- tion? 04 20 02 50 _ okay, i've got it on at focus at infinity; i've got the zoom at 30 or 40 or 50; i'll put in 75; and i got the f-stop at 22."
"roger, al; we copy."
"i've got it pointing exactly opposite of the sun here, so -"
"al, we see no change at all in the scene. why don't you just give it a little tap? it may be the color wheel is hung up."
i put this antenna up 1 foot too close.
"hey, houston, it won't hurt if my plss antenna hits this s-band antenna, will it?"
"stand by on that, pete."
"pete, that's no problem."
okay.
"hey, al."
yes.
"come over here. you're going to have to help me line up this antenna. 04 20 04 51 _ ail right. houston, i'm going to leave the camera just pointed off in the distance, if you get any ideas, i'd be glad to work on it for you."
"roger, al. try and point it off where you don't get any reflectance into it_ and we'll be thinking about it here on the ground."
"okay. the plug that runs right into the back of the tv, it's sort of a white plastic material, and it looks like it's cracked and may_je been melted a little bit. it doesn't look _ypical of that sort of connector. pag _e42 *, confident day"
"stand around to the back. no, no. no, you got to go around - go around so you can look at the an- tenna and tell me when i've got it pointed at the earth."
ail right.
"no, don't get underneath it. that a boy."
okay.
"now. whoops, see what i mean; this thing - you're going to have - really going to have to watch that alsep. you could trip over this whole antenna without even blinking at it."
"okay, go ahead."
can you see the earth?
no.
you've got to get around here. the earth and the sun are right lined up. you're going to have to look right into the sun and look up in the sky. watch it; you're on the tv antenna - i mean cable.
okay.
"see what i'm trying to do? i've got to pitch over now, right?"
"yes. oh, there it is. i got you now. bet we can hide it."
yes.
"i tell you where you need to go, pete. okay, that's good. now you need to point - you need to rotate the whole thing counterclockwise. that's good. you're getting there - getting there. that old earth's just hanging up there."
okay. how much further?
"oh, i'd say another 3 or 4 degrees maybe. stop. good boy. okay, now. wait. that looks just good, as far as angles. now, up and down - confident"

"ail right, now wait a minute. don't - don't let me knock it over, but i got to - 04 20 07 13 lm_ okay. i'm trying to stabilize it for you."
"yes, but every time you do, you push it in the -"
okay. you go ahead.

i don't see the earth anywhere in the sight. too close. got any ideas of which way to go?
yes. just like that.
"say, we're going to have to - let's push these legs in a little bit and get this thing more stable. get this thing in the dirt."
okay.
don't break them. that thing is delicate.
"i know it; now, it's in the dirt. now, let's line her up."
"okay. can you look right down the mast? lt o n fidelxt,i ..iu 04 20 07 55 kno yes. it looks like it's lined up to me. we'll just have to move in and try it, because you're awfully close -"
about as - how is it in azimuth? and i'll look for it in pitch.
"come a little bit more clockwise. you're right on it, bede; stop. now, run it up and down in pitch, and you're bound to get it."
no. i've got to go the other way and get it. _oops! i just saw the earth. hold it. take your hands off it.
i can't; it'll fall over.
"no. leave it alone. - - 04 20 08 32 tj_p you're pulling on it. you're pulling on it, here."

"try opening up the f-stop all the way and exercis- ing the zoom. 04 20 10 05 l_ i sure will. boy, we sure don't want to touch those cables."
"no, we've got to stay away from those cables; you're right."
got a camera with you?
i certainly do.
"okay, just hang on to it. houston, how much - how long have we been out?"
"pete, you've been out 1 hour and 2 minutes, and you're both running about 2 minutes off nominal, behind."

"okay, well, i'll tell you what. i can feel that the wheels, when i hold the - when i hold the end of the lens, i can feel the wheels running, because i can feel something in motion inside. okay, now, i just changed completely the settings i had before. the f-stop's is still 22, but i can try something else - -"
"okay, al, we see no change down here. why don't you press on?"
"okay, let me - let me try another f-stop, the other way. how's that?"
"there's no change down here, al. that's coming in there, now, al. okay, what change did you make?"
i hit it on the top with my hammer. i figured we didn't have a thing to lose. i just pounded it on top with this hammer i've got.
"skillful fix, al."
"yes, that's skilled craftsmanship. ***"
"hey, that's - a1 -"
"yes, sir."
that part has already sheared this thing.
never touched it.
okay.
"what should we do now with the lens, houston?"
"okay, why don'_ you give it one more light rap, and also cut down the f-stop?"
"ail right, will do. now, is the zoom right for you?"
...
"oh, darn .... you really got this, al."
okay.
down the ...
"al, we're still not getting a good picture. why don't you press on, and we'll try to get back to it later, if ye have time."
"okay, i'll pound it a little bit. there you go. i'll just leave it like it is, pointed slightly towards the lm here, so that if you do get a picture, you'll see something."
ready to go now.
that ought to give you some sort of a picture that you can think about. i'll be glad to come back and work on it. got to go to work again.

"yes, sir."
what i need is a piece of tape.

is a1 doing all the work?
"no, sir. i'm headed out to do the pan photographs right now; and, with any luck at all, we'll get back on the time line and complete what we need. al's taking shcts of the solar wind, and itm hopping out here to the number 1 slot."

"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -"
"do you hear a little background noise, pete? kind of staticky and things?"
i keep hearing a whistle.
that's what i hear. okay.
"okay, houston, two of the pan's are done."
"roger, pete. copy. two pan's. al, how was the lm inspection?"
i'm working on it right now.
roger.
"taking a look at that surveyor, al; i should suspect we ought to be able to get there quite readily. i'm going to head down there by the crater a little bit for this set of pan's - whoops ..."
watch yourself; it's easy to slide.
"yes, you can say that again. i notice you've been over here, haven't you?"
yes ....
"i don't think this is going to show anything, but i'll give it a go."
what's that?
"oh, i'm trying to show the front gear here and how it went - how it planted itself, but it's not really - it's not bright enough."
"give it a go, though."
uh-oh.
"bad?  to nfiden'i:.i:,/ j )ay"
i think my camera's -
this pad bounced.
*** your plus y bounced about pad diameter.
that'd be an interesting picture there.
"al, do you have any comments on the footpad inter- action with the surface?"
"yes, i do. actually we - pete's pads went in a little bit further than did neil's; i'd say most of the pads are in about an inch and a half to two, and it sort of looked like we were moving slightly forward, and that pretty well killed off our left-right velocity when we touched down. the right-hand footpad seems to have bounced; that'd be the plus y, the right-hand-side one; the others don't seem to have. so it must have - maybe hit there first, and rocked back and forth or something."
"roger, al. do you see anything on the surface from the dps?"
"no, i don't. the surface under there - it's kind of interesting ' the surface under there is clean. it doesn't have the loose dust particles that - as does the rest of the lunar surface about here. it also has a number of small round dirt clods if you want, that seem to be ... off in a radial direction from underneath the skirt of the engine. i'll take a couple of pictures ... good shots ... just about 8 inches or so off the ground. i think i can get a good one for you, houston. there we go."
"thank you, al. it's a good description."
"say, you can really move around out here, houston. that a mobile pogo ridge that we've got there, and also that one in the centrifuge - man, it's just like this. you can just run and bounce just like you can on that pogo. it's a real good training device. iconfidenti"
"where are you, al?"
i'm over here back - the back tee - i'_ ready to - to start the alsep ... when you are.
okay. i got the ... and i'm coming around.
ail right.
"okay, houston, i went back to intermediate cooling."
roger. we copy that.
"good idea. say, i've noticed when you get started moving down that way, it's sometimes hard to stop."
yes. hold on to this.
ail right.
we're putting on our saddlebags now - -
"pete and al, you're 1 plus 22 into the time line, and you're running about 6 minutes behind nominal."
we're going to catch up right now - -
we're monitoring plss feedwater 2 as a determining parameter.
"okay, houston. we'll start catching up now. we've kind of gotten over the initial checkout on how to walk and move around, and maybe we got - we won't have any problems with this hardware like we did with the - - 04 20 31 08 _ ... here you go."
- - in the antenna.
roger. and we're showing 2 plus 30 left in the eva.
okay.
"okay, pete, your saddlebag's on."
"all right, let's go. confidentiait"
"okay, and we're off to ... the alsep ...."
no. we ought to be able to move out with this thing.
the lm exterior looks real good. the lm exterior looks beautiful the whole way around. real good shape .... that doesn't look like it did the day we launched it.
right.
"okay. here we go, pete. 0hh, up they go, ..., one alsep. there it is."
"there it is, is right. it is laying on the lunar surface. better go to intermediate cooling, get good and chilled down. okay?"
"hey, it's dusty, isn't it? you've got to go easy."
you sure do. 04 20 32 50 i4p here it comes.
coming right up.
"hey, that's about right."
"widen that out on the boom, houston. sure looks pretty."
"roger, pete. we copy."
"look at me, pete. it's a good shot, babe. the lm and everything's reflected in your visor."
"lay her on the ground. okay, i'll bring mine out."
"right out on the moon, just like advertised."
wait until i get this out of your way.
okay.
"yankee clipper, houston. omni charlie, 0mni charlie. confidentiab"
it's going to look like - -
say again.
going to look like the back of the flightcrew training ... in a minute.
yes.
"okay. that, ... there is coming closed. uh-oh. ail right, you can push that door."
how do i ... that one?
i don't know.
"hey, al, when i free this strap, would you mind ...?"
"let me look, pete. i have one here. let me get it out for you."
"thank you, sir."
"okay, lift your left foot up and you're okay."
okay. thank you.
"yankee clipper, houston. high gain antenna: pitch, minus 13; yaw, 225."
"hey, houston, do you hear this constant beeping in the background? on the comm."
that's affirmative.
what is it?
we've heard it now for about the past 45 minutes. pag1e56 i confidential. ' 5
"that's right, so have we. what is it?"
"intrepid, we've tried to isolate it. it appears as though it's coming on the downlink where it's coming from the lm."
"hey, al."
just a second.
"hey, there's your lunar tools, all set up for you, fellow."
okay.
this alsef's doing okay.
"old chuck wetherred will be happy to know we're throwing it up for him, here. that's all right."
"here you go. now, what do you need of these? 04 20 39 08 _ i need anything you've got. there you go - -"
good.
- - i need that tool.
how about this? you need that one?
"how about the - here, let me put that on. no, no. you put that in package 2, and i'll pick that up later."
it's already in package 2.
"then, one must be yours."
"okay. okay, i put that there. oonfidential"
"excuse me, pete, i'll move it over and plant it. 04 20 39 _6 cdr wait a minute."
ail right.
got to put this together right - where's the arrow? we've got to let down the cap while we wait?
wait a minute. here you go.
okay.
"put this together. 04 20 40 13 l35 houston, we're going to go ahead and put down the fuel cask right now, and then i'll take the fila- ment out of it."
"roger, al. copy. you're working with the fuel cask."
"wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
"i knew it. this is such a bad place to put it, pete."
huh?
that's a bad place to put it. oh 20 40 39 cdr yes. 04 20 40 42 iap fuel cask comes down beautifully in position. came down just right.
"oh, i know what i have to do, al, and i'm standing here not doing it. 158 ii confidentialg da5y"
"okay, now you need to move the side on in."
"we're moving right along, houston. we're ***"
"yankee clipper, houston. go to wide deadband."
"houston. you can tog me for my first ... on the moon. 04 20'41 35 cdr hey, houston."
"something that's real interesting, as we put out this alsep right - -"
"pete, go ahead."
"there's one thing that's pretty obvious, as we're setting out the components of the alsep here, is i just hope that these thermal coatings don't have to stay as white as they are right now, be- cause there's just no way. with all this dust, there's just no possibility that - -"
you cannot get them a little bit dirty. and - -
little bit dirty isn't the word for it.
"i know it. this - this - this - this - this is real - going to be a real problem, i guess, if thermally they've got to maintain ***. everything that touches the ground picks it up. this suit is about half dirty because the strap landed on it. uh-oh. it's a little dirty even on top of the fuel element, there. okay."
wait just a minute now before you - get carried away. c_.i nfidentia
"al, we copy your comments."
***. okay.
i guess we'll just have to make allowances for things like that when we build them. they sure are going to get dirty.
"okay, i'm unlocking the cask dome, right now. it unlocks perfectly, shaking it now and trying to get it off. there you go."
it came off beautifully. put the tool and in the - dome aside.
very nice.
okay. i'll get out the cask removal tool.
"you can stand over there, pete."
okay. i've got to - got to go back to min cooling. i'm about to freeze to death.
...
yes. okay. go ahead.
"yes, oh."
"okay, now start. there you go."
... in there.
"okay, tighten up the locks ..."
hold it.
... be chipped.
"there. screw it all the way down. that could make a guy mad, you know it?"
yes.
"let me undo it a minute, and try it a different 'way."
yes.
"it can really get you mad. houston, a1 put the tool on, screwed it all the way down, and the fuel element would not come out of the can. he's taking the tool off, and he's working it again."
"roger, pete. we copy."
you got any suggestions?
... kind of surprised me there.
***?
come over and look.
"i tell you that worries me, pete. if i pull on it too hard, there's a very delicate lock mechanism."
"better not push the pins in quite so far, and wiggle it a little. i just get the feeling that it's hot and swelled in there or something. doesn't want 'to come out."
"i can sure feel the heat, though, on my hands. come out of there, rascal."
suppose it's outgassed or something?
"say, houston."
*** ahead.
"okay. we've really got a problem, i guess. i've tried using different pins; you know, it's got a three-pin removal - - 04 20 h6 17 cdr dual. onfideniaj."
"- - so i tried using different pins in different holes. that doesn't appear to haye any effect. it operates - you know - everything operates just exactly like it does in the training mockups - and - up at ge. the only problem is, it just won't come out of the cask. i am suspicious that it's pulling in there or something and friction's hold- ing it in. but it's such a delicate tool, i really hate to - to pull on it too hard. i believe what we can do, pete - -"
"hey, i'll be right with you."
- - go get that h_mmer and bang on the side of it.
no. i got a better idea. where's the hammer?
that's what i said.
"no, no. but i want to try and put the back end in under that lip there and pry her out. let me go get the hammer. be right back. where did you put it?"
huh? what? hammer's on the mesa.
okay. let me get the tool off. it's starting to warm up.
okay.
"can't figure that out, houston."
"hey, now."
"look, pete."
huh?
"al, when you're working on that, try to make sure you've got the pins all the way in, tighten up on it; then you can try pushing down on it a little, before you pull it out."
"okay. don't - don't touch these. these are - if these break off, that's all she wrote. confidentf/ it 5"
yes. i understand.
and don't pound on anything that'll break.
"no, no. i'm not going to."
okay. we'll try it again.
"rotate and try it this way. 04 20 48 16 l_p pry's in there just like you - going to do the job, only it just doesn't do the job."
"oh man, look at the dust fly."
just a minute. just - just a minute. get those pins in here again.
you're not getting those pins all the way in.
"they're not in now because i'm lining them up. just a damn minute. now, they are all the way in."
"they're all the way in - not quite. that bottom one down there's - now, my recommendation would be pound on the cask ..."
yes.
"hey, that's doing it; give it a few more pounds. got to be harder than that. it's going - it's coming out."
keep going.
it's coming out. pound harder.
keep going ....
come on ...
"keep going, baby. that hammer's a universal tool."
you better believe it; there you got it.
"got it. got it, houston. confidenti,/ i!"
(laughter) that's beautiful. that's voo much.
"now, i think i'll put the - -"
"well done, troops."
"we got it, babe. it fits in the - ***."
"hey, don't ever - don't ever come to the moon without a hammer."
"yankee clipper, houston. one minute to los."
"that's it, pete."
(laughter)
that's outstanding.
(laughter)
make our move -
i'm ready .... going.
"okay, houston. the fuel element is in the rtg. i can feel it radiate heat already. put your hand over here, pete."
that's amazing. wait a minute - no.
"copied that, al."
"no, wait a minute, al; have you got it strapped around your boot? let me look and see."
okay.
"no, you're all right."
ail right?
yes.
"boy, this thermal coating doesn't mean a thing here. 164 i'confid'ent!:a )ay"
yes. that thing is really getting covered with dirt. my gosh.
i hope they made allowances for it.
*** do. okay ....... ?
it doesn't look like it's - let me look at that just a second.
okay.
it's the right way.
that's it.
"hey, feel the heat off that machine. that's amazing."
1400 degrees.
almost as hot as the sun.
okay. sure it is (laughter).
"hey, do me a favor."
what do you need? ...
"no, go lower. there you go; you got it."
"okay. okay, let me go - scout - smoke over the area. okay. okay, let me go - scout - smoke over the area. okay."
got everything you need?
"ail right, there's no tv, so i got the side - and the picker-uppers for the rocks."
okay.
okay. let's go right off to that little mound over there. how does that grab you?
okay. something's wrong.
"what's the matter? icon fident!jjl,jj"
"*** the thing doesn't - *** okay. okay, pete. we're okay."
"pete, we copy. you've got the uht tongs and _%- pallet."
"we're making our move, houston. 04 20 52 09 _ ahhh, i can tell this is going to be work - out. now, take it easy."
"how long did you say our shadow was - the lm's shadow, 150 feet?"
"no, that isn't any 150 feet."
"stand by, pete. 0h 20 52 32 cdr take your time, al; i'm just going out - -"
that's what i'm saying. what's the hurry? we got it made.
"no, i'm just going out to scout the area, that's all."
"okay, i'm going to set it down and rest."
okay.
go to intermittent cooling.
"*** 04 20 52 43 _ okay. 04 20 52 53 l_ you know, they ought to build this equipment for lunar operations some other color besides white."
(laughter)
"i'm going to go right up to the head crater, i guess."
"well, if you're going to do anything - -"
*** let me move it. move it some more. got any directions you want me to go? _4
"well, it looks to me like either the direction you're headed is good or the one a little bit more to the right. you're going to - you're going to have to go far enough so we don't end up in one of the craters when we start to ... deploy."
okay.
okay.
but i want to go 10 degrees off our takeoff angle; and i think i'm headed out about that way now.
okay.
you just stay back there and take your time. i'll go out here and scout the area.
you're getting pretty far out.
huh?
getting pretty far out.
i'm going to do a slow - -
"pete and al, your lm shadow should be about 110 feet."
"okay, i'm looking for - i'm dying to find out what this mound is over here anyhow, al. we got a very peculiar mound sticking up out of the ground, houston, that i want to go look at. as a matter of fact, i think i'll go take a picture of it. oh my -"
look at how that lm is ...
... is it?
"roger, pete. could you give us your position and distance with respect to the lm?"
wait 1.
"go ahead, pete, and do what you're doing. pete's about - i'd guess, about 300 feet at 12 o'clock. t,.confidenti he's in the bottom of a shallow crater vhat you probably see on your map. it's sort o__a doublet. okay?"
i'm headed to the right-hand edge of the head crater.
"hey, al. here's a neat spot to put it out up here. 04 20 55 15 l_ is it flat for a good piece?"
"oh, you'd better believe it."
"okay, we'll put that - it's a good long ways away, too; it must be at least - what - 500 feet from the lm?"
i don't know. 04 20 55 26 _ 600?
"it's the world's most peculiar - i got to photo- graph this thing. i can't imagine what it is. a mound is sticking up; and i can't imagine how it got there or what would make it. i 04 20 55 44 lmp boy, you can cover the ground on this light-weight ... at one-sixth g. really move."
i got to get them a stereo of this thing. it's really fantastic.
"how's our time line going, houston?"
*** sit here and really rest awhile.
"pete, at 1 plus 48 into the eva, you're looking good. looks as though you're right on there, if you've just about completed your traverse."
"we have, houston. yes. yes. now, look, al. look over here. we're way out from the lm. over here, al."
okay.
see where i'm headed? this great big flat area. age168 jonfident day
"that's a good - hey, there's another one of those mounds over there."
"where? hey, you're right. what do you suppose they are?"
"i don't know, houston , what they are; they're just sort of mounds. look like - don't take this the wrong way. it looks like a small volcano, only it's just about 4 feet high; and it's about - at the top, it's about 5 feet across; and it then slopes from the top on down to the - level with the terrain, and that - that diameter, that circle - where it finally becomes level with the terrain, is about 15 or 20 feet. so, it looks sort of like a small volcano. there's a couple of them out here. they look like they were formerly made out of mud or something."
"afl,roger. we copy. is there any hole or central vent?"
i don't know. i'm not - -
i got to go over - we'll - we'll - -
wa'ii go look them over.
- - ... after we get the alsep out. there's a couple of them here. there was a - this is a - we couldn't ask for a better spot to put this alsep down. 04 20 57 31 _p no. this is nice.
"***, too."
"hey, lot more rocks up here."
"listen, there's a - we could play geologist for 2 days and never get any f_rther than we are right now. seeing all different kinds of things."
"hey, here's a different one."
yes. it's really neat. better than any ... geology in houston (laughter). ctonfidential
"i'm getting a quick pan of the area here to - ... down this alsep deployment - there you go. ok 20 58 07 cdr okay, man alive."
tired?
"no, i'm not so tired. that handle, you know, when you carry this thing around in one g, the alsep tends to hang down, but you carry it around up here at one-sixth g, in particularly, the rtg tends to rotate - and the whole pallet, so, in a few minutes, you've got one up - kind of halfway up in the air and the other one's down by your left leg, and you keep being afraid that this handle's going to come undone. it doesn't - your handle doesn't lock. okay. i have to almost - that's slick. you know these neat little decals we got on here?"
yes.
you can't hardly read them in the sunlight because they don't have enough contrast to them. they're so bright.
"okay, let's move them."
okay. let me make sure now that we're not going to run out into some holes.
"that's pretty good. pete, i'm going to move just a little bit further to the east - correction, to the north, so that i won't end up over in that hole to the side. okay?"
"ail right. yes, i think it would be a real good spot. 04 20 59 49 _i okay, i'm - -"
awfully frustrating.
"now, i think this is the spot, pete, right here. f"
you look and make sure now that we're going to have a good place for everything. age -70 onfid'ent day
"yes, we will. magnetometer can sit over there and the seismometer will sit on a good flat place_ although the trouble with the seismometer, we don't have any good solid bedrock or anything to set it on. all we've got is this - this dirt. and i don't see any area around that has any rock."
i'm afraid we're just going to have to take what we can get on this seis - -
"roger, al."
"you know, this must be some thermal expansion or something. i'm having a beck of a time getting this uht in this side. it just flat won't go in there."
"well, just pick it up with your hands. i always handled the side with my hands."
i can't bee -bend down that far. 04 21 00 52 _ okey-doke ....
"where'd you go, al?"
"i'm right over here, babe."
"oh, you're miles away."
"yes, i am. i moved over here."
"oh, son of a gun."
"i had to do it, pete, so that i'd have a good place for the side."
"okay, there's a good spot. looks good."
"al, when you deploy that pse stool, it would help if you tamp that ground down as well as you could before putting the stool down. i i"
"i'm going to try to do that. this - this ground is - is not - you know; it doesn't get hard as you t move down a couple of inches - you can tamp it, and that's what i'm plan to do; but i don't know. onfidentiat ii we'll just have to see what happens. _ - i'm worried about it getting a thermal short myself."
"roger, al. 04 21 03 06 l_ boy, i'll tell you."
"man, are you dirty."
"boy, this sure ... that alsep. look at the alsep."
i know.
ridiculous.
(laughter) 04 21.03 18 lmp i remember how they took care of this white paint. you had to have gloves to touch it.
(laughter)
remember?
yes (laughter). they got kind of a problem here.
"i'm going to have to do this myself. i'll have to do this backwards; but it's going to work right. do me a favor, pete."
"i got my hands full, buddy (laughter). i'll be with you in a minute."
okay. that's okay.
you can relieve me in this side right here while i -- --

"watch it, watch it. where's the orange stripe?"
should be same as on that other one.
"obviously, it's on the side i can't see."
yes. blue to blue.
"you know that noise - that whistling - is coming from you, pete, because every time you move around, it whistles. when you stop, it quits."

yes. there it is.
is it locked good?
"yes, sir. okay, you're - -"

"no. before you do that, come here a second, would you, please?"
"yes, but let me set it down."
"uh-oh, the top popped open."
supposed to do that?
"no. not supposed to do that. you can close it, though, before it gets any dirt in it. you can just reach up there and close it."

okay.
"pete, before you set the central station down for the final time, would you also tamp that ground down? it would help in keeping the dirt off of the thermally sensitive areas."
"oh, i did it; i did it (laughter)."
you set it down.
"i set it down and it didn't fall over. i can't believe it. here i come. what do you need, al?"
"use your tongs to hold this up a minute. it's a little hot, and i don't want to touch it. watch this."
where are my tongs?

(laughter)
you really move better that way.
"here i come, ready or not."
"houston, i'm - i'm not kidding; we are really getting dirty out here. there's no way to handle all this equipment with all the dust on it. every time you move something, the dust flies; and, in this low gravity, it really takes off, goes way up in the air, and then comes down and lands on you."
how far do you estimate we're from the lm? 600 feet? 700 feet? 04 21 08 34 i24p at least.
"i think you're right. 600, 700 feet."
way to do it.
here i come. do do de-dum.

"okay. wait a minute, let me move that dust cover for you."
how's that strike you?
okay. just leave this latch - -
"hey, i'm making a joke -"
strikes me pretty good. i'll be tamping the dirt around this central station.
"okay, going to have to design things with little legs on them or something, so you can put them down and they stand off the soil (laughter)."
"if we had that suit we could bend over in, we'd have the job done by now."
"hey, can you push down on this side of that? 04 21 t0 27 cdr yes. my biggest sweat is trying to bend over. wait a minute. ready, get set, push. that on, or not?"

"roger, pete. well done."
"okay. let me tamp the dirt down underneath the central station. hey, easy does it - whoops! (laughter) that's me."
what happened?
"oh, i started to walk away with the central station attached to the uht via the little gizzy. okay?"
the rtg's down and cooking.
"okay. i'm tamping the dirt, here."
okay.
have i got it tamped pretty good? look over where i'm tamping. how am i doing? pag1e78 iconfid'enti da5y
"looks good. need a little bit more this way, i think. the problem with tamping_ pete, it looks like every time you tamp, as your foot comes up - you know it - -"
yes. in tamping - -
it redusts - it redusts the area.
"yes. okay. here we go, al. now, take your u - u- uht, there - -"

"can't see that needle anywhere. can you, al?"
let me see it. let me help you. doesn't it show any amps?
place is covered with dust.
i know.
"pete and al, at 2 hours and 7 minutes into the i eva, you're about 5 minutes behind."
okay.
pull - hold me a little bit.
wait a minute. going back to min cooling. what do you need?
hold - hold me to look.
"oh, okay ...."
i don't even see a needle in there. pag1e80 tconfidentt' i
"i don't either. that's what's bothering me. it's not reading zero, and i don't see a needle."
"i don't even see a needle in there, houston."
yes. okay. let's quit screwing with it. get on the time line.
i don't know where it went.
"houston, did you get our last comment?"
"negative, pete. go ahead."
we can't see a needle in the shorting amps any- where. it's not at zero. it's not in sight.
roger. we copy. go ahead.
"we're not done for the mag - for the - seismom- eters, houston. and i've sort of dug a little crater so that the - essentially the stool - the hole in the center of the stool, has - is de - is de - has more clearance between it and the ground. hopefully, this will keep the side from ... the ground at all. going to try anyway."
roger s al. that's good. go ahead.
... the seismometer. we'll see - we'll see how it works. it looks like it might work. i tamped it also in the - in the small crater there.
okay. i've got the solar wind deployed here. okay. just a minute.
"boy, you really have to be careful of these cables, don't you? 04 21 18 40 _ hey, it looks good. looks good."
"okay. after the solar wind, i get an _ check and i'm down to min-cooling, anyhow; and it says lsm off load, two boyd bolts. wait a minute. let me by. whoops."
"okay, now. onfidenti.a _."
"say, we have to be careful. don't move sideways or backwards. you just don't know what's there. you've always got to move forwards."
"yes. pete, could you shove the central station this way a little bit?"
"pete, we copy an emu check."
shove it?
"just move - just put your thing in the - in the holder, and just move it over this way a little bit."
"i'm not sure i can do that, but i'll give it a try."
watch it. there you go.
how's that for one-footed - la-dee-da?
pretty good.
"you make me knock my solar wind over, i'm going to be mad at you,"
"okay. you're just - here, let me give you a hand."
make sure you - you hold it there.
"hey, don't - don't touch that. i've got a - one boyd bolt off it."
aren't you going to ...?
huh?
want me to help you move it that way?
no. it's got one boyd bolt out of that magnetometer.
okay. okay. go ahead.
"what we're doing it, making a mess. you'd be better off - let me - listen, can you - you - leave - leave it sit. let me hold that. you - you put that stool back here closer."
okey-dokey.
am i over all the cables?
okay.
huh?
"no, you're okay. you got it?"
yes. let me have it. ail right?
yes. take your clip off.
"okay. 04 21 20 33 i_4p all right, now, you move your stool back."
... a second.
okay. *** your emu break.
i am.
i try to stay away from - that's a nice job on that solar wind.
thank you. you've got to be careful you don't kick dirt on them once we get them setting down. i guess the way you could do it is have - have it in some sort of package - a package out on the dirt.
what are you doing anyhow?
"well, i had to get this - oh, i'm sorry."
here you go; move it up right here where my foot- prints are. 04 21 21 21 i24p okay. tconfiden.ii
"there. that a boy. that a boy. now don't - doing good. there, now, kind of tamp it right around in there. that a boy."
"*** go off the central peak. now, let's see what happens if we set it right -"
that's good.
"that looks like it'd be okay, doesn't it?"
yes.
just a second. let me do a couple of things. do this ... take ... a little bit out of there.
pull it over a little bit more and level it up.
"this doesn't - yes, this doesn't need to he level. okay. that's got kind of a deeper hole there in the center."
"yes. you're in good shape. that doesn't have to level, huh?"
"no, because the - the other one levels ... this stool."
okay. push it down a little bit.
okay. that's a good idea.
*** it?
looking good. looking good.
"just give me the tongs, and i'll put them away."
okay.
"get with it and i'll start opening boyd bolts. 04 21 22 50 imp that's going to do okay, pete. i 04 21 22 53 cdr thank you."
yes. onfidenti' ii
ail right.
"*** i'd whistle while i work. i can't do it. (whistle) oh, yes, i can."
okay. that seismometer's right in position now. here's hoping. here's hoping nothing happens to it.
"looks real good, al."
"yes, it does. it looks like it's going to clear. houston, looks like digging that little hole might work. setting up there nice now, and it looks like maybe it's not going to ... down in the hole. maybe - maybe we did it. we'll have to see."
"roger, al. we concur; it sounds like a good plan."
whoops!
isn't that something? look at that.
"what? just have to put a little dirt on it, i guess."
"when i put out the skirt of this foil, it doesn't want to lie down. i guess because it's been folded so long. i guess i can just probably just put it out. it acts almost like it's got an electrostatic charge on it that's resisting the lunar surface. i'm sure that isn't it."
"hey, stop 1 second. watch out. don't - don't come across - don't - i know. that's what i want you to do is come take it."
okay.
"that cable isn't even unreeling. see, it's per- fect. take it out there and set it. that a boy."
it's right behind there. you may - - j i
there you go. cidnfidentiaj
"just trip it. you might want to trip iz - trim it off that thing, pete."
trip it off what?
it's on that post.
oh. ail right. i see what you're talking about.
that shadow's going to be just right. looking okay.
"oh, fiddle-de-diddle. come on."
"okay. everything is going great, but that whistle is driving me nuts. bothering you?"
a little bit.
"okay. oh, darn it. i can't - can't help but get dirt on this darn thing, no matter how careful i am."
"i don't think there's a way, pete. i don't think there's a way. but you got - if you got where you could - you put it out in a package and then your last step was - like the side over there, it just deploys off the thermal wrapping, your dirt protector, and you end up with a nice clean experiment sitting there."
"how we doing on the time line, houston?"
"stand by, pete."
whooo! (laughter) 02 21 27 10 i/qp what happened?
"oh, it's just the way things pop off down here in one-sixth g. okay. won't be long and i'll get to my favorite task, pointing the antenna."
"pete, we show you're about 8 to 10 minutes behind but it's no sweat. you've got - you got lots of oxygen and feedwater. we'll give you an update on the time remaining, when you finish deploying the alsep. pag1e86 onfident'!. day 04 21 27 41 cdr/lmp okay. 04 21 27 42 l_ good. looks like it's going real good, houston. this seismometer, i'm having a little trouble making the skirt lie down; but, other than that_ it looks good. it doesn't want to just lay flat like it does on earth at one g. it sort of wants to flip up again. i guess it's just because it's got this memory in it from being folded so long, and the forces to make it lie down aren't too good."
"roger, al. you can make a two-man task out of that and put a little dirt around the outside edge to hold it down if you like."
"okay. well, i noticed that if i just - -"
"you won't have any trouble getting any dirt on it, will you?"
let me push this down. that'll do it.
"okay, pete. let me level it up. i think it's pretty near level. it's lined up exactly east. if i give it a couple of pushes."
i got this feeling there's a couple of boyd bolts that aren't undone here for some reason.
thing looks level as can be to me.
looks good.
"roger, al. copy. you have the bubble centered."
"i'll tell you an interesting thing about this bubble, houston; no, it's okay. it's okay."
"i am not happy here, al. i'm afraid something ... one these boyd bolts is not undone, and i don't understand why. 04 21 29 55 l_ why, one of them didn't do or what?"
"well, i don't know. i haven't the foggiest idea. i thought all of them did. n.fential..:"
looked like you're well ahead of the time.
"hey, take your stick and kick a little dirt up on it right there."
huh?
"take your stick and just put a little dirt on the edge, just on the edge, though. not much. uh-oh. i got some bad news."
that's okay. i won't do that anymore. _at's okay; that skirt'll stay down enough.
"okay. that's - that's complete. let me take a couple of pictures of it. okay, houston. the passive seismic is down; the alignment is exactly 90 degrees, and i'm going to take a couple pictures of it here. hey, al."
"yes, sir."
"i don't know what's the matter, but something is."
here it is.
"okay. would you look and see if the lens on my camera looks clean? wait a minute. 04 21 31 11 _ there, you got it made."
"no, i don't either. i don't know what's the matter."
want me to hold down this part'while you get that other bolt -
push - push - push that center down. all right? looks good.
oops. got it.
very good.
that's beautiful.
"hey, it's alive (laughter). cj)nfidenttal"
"it sure wants to come up, doesn't it? whoo_"
that did it.
that's beautiful.
that did it.
"houston, central station's up."
"roger. copy. central station up, and 90 degrees on the pse gnomon."
"hey, al."
"yes, sir."
never mind. i'll get you in a minute.
don't ever move backwards (laughter).
"hey, we're going to have to do a lot of - what did you do, fall over?"
no.
no?
"no, but i just - i didn't come close even - it's just that - i think something you want to follow as a rule - -"
but don't kick dirt on this - -
i'm doing my best.
...
... and the central station is not level.
not too bad.
"get a good shot of it here, pete?"
okay.
"okay, i'll take out the - the magnetometer. onfidenti"
central station went up so nice.
"al, those are my last two boyd bolts."
okay.
"i'm down in a little crater now, houston; and, sure enough, right in the bottom of the craters, there is a lot more - a lot softer dust than up on the rim. not much; but it's noticeable, i don't think the sides are slippery at all. i don't think it's going to bother us going over to get our surveyor ... about that distance, pete?"
"roger, al. we copy. you on your way out with the lsm? 04 21 34 36 _ that's right. got it right in hand; i'm out at the end of the line, and i'm deploying the legs right now."
roger.
"one antenna mast in place, houston. going back for the - my favorite thing."
are you through with - you got all these other packing ... - -
"roger, pete. copy antenna mast in place and good luck."
what'd you - -
"look at that, pete."
what?
"hey, one of the fun things here, houston, is all these styrofoam packing blocks that come off - to - that are put on there to protect it during man - shipment, or launch - when you take them off and throw them, they really sail. these things stay airborne up for 10 seconds, maybe."
"got any more thoughts on our tv camera, houston? confiden'ial."
pete? pete.
what?
watch this.
(laughter)
"(laughter) try that on - hey, i just threw something. it hasn't hit the ground yet; it must have gone up 300 feet. boing!"
(laughter) stop playing and get to work (laughter). come on. maybe they'll extend us until 4-1/2 hours. i feel like i could stay out here all day....
i know it ... right there. okay.
"pete, we've been thinking on that camera, and when you get back, we'll have a test for you to run on it. it looks as though part of it's come back. and we're going to try and see what we can salvage."
ok - okay.
"what do you think happened to it, houston?"
"al, we're not sure on that. why don't you wait until you get back - wait until you get back at the lm, and we'll work it out a bit and see if we can determine it?"
ail right.
"hey, al?"
"yes, sir."
"gee, that's nice. gee, that's weird (laughter). 04 21 37 11 i_p (laughter) those arms, on earth they just flop down in position. here, they don't even want to stay. there they go."
that thing hit the ground; it's still bouncing. cionfidential
"that's slick. that's really slick. boy, i hope - i hope - -"
"hello, yankee clipper; houston."
"you hope, you hope?"
"oh, i was just thinking about something. pete, no way to keep these things clean; i'm really worried about this white coating."
lucky for me that the antenna head is almost level.
i can see that. this dot doesn't - doesn't seem hard to see.
i'll see what i can do with it. there it is. here it is. i think. right there. right in the center. center.
"yankee clipper, houston."
"hello, houston; clipper here."
"dick, the eva - eva is going pretty well; they're 2-1/2 hours into it; and they've got the alsep a good way deployed. apparently, both of them look as though they just crawled out of a coal bin. other than that, seems pretty much nominal."
"very good. thank you. 04 21 39 40 i/_p okay, houston. the magnetometer's deployed; it's level, and it's pointed exactly east. and the little black dot is right in the middle ..."
same - -
"roger, al. copy. 04 21 39 57 _ same - main concern here, there's just a lot of dust on top of the box and the electronics there. just hope it doesn't bother it too much."
"roger, al. yankee clipper, we have a map update for rev 19. pag1e92 cidnfidenti / day"
"rev 19: los 118:48:40, 119:13:30, 119:34:33."
"okay, pete, let me take a couple of pictures of this .... 04 21 40 56 _cdr what are you mumbling about over there?"
"well, i just - i just don't - i don't like all that dirt on it; don't know what we can do though. there's no way to work around them; the radiator's got a little dirt on it, and there's no way to dust it off, and there is no way - ail you can do is tap it a little bit and hope some of it falls off and that's about it. don't want to tap it too hard. that's the best i can do."
"okay. 04 2i 42 16 i2_p okay. okay. i've deployed the side now, pete."
okay.
it's my last item.
not my last one.
okay.
does the antenna look like it's pointed at earth? wait.
it looks close.
that's it....
okay.
do the side right now.
got her.
"okay. 04 21 43 32 i_mp okay. i hope i don't tug on the station here, as i come out, pete."
if that happens - (jonfiden'ri
"it all looks pretty level, by the way. your station does."
yes.
"we're nearing the end, i'll bet. 04 21 44 21 imp i'm done."
how's that -
now it's just - (laughter) - they must have doubled the cable length on this ones
that does it? 04 21 44 51 _mp okay.
you're at the end. you're at the end.
okay. let me set it down and work on it right here.
"that does it, old buddy."
okay.
okay. now what do i want to do?
"... do like that, does it?"
have you got the tongs?
what?
have you got the tongs? were they with that box - or do i have them?
you've probably got them on you.
"i do? i can't see - no, they weren't with that box. 04 21 45 50 i_mp we used them - they're prob_oly by your central station."
"hey, i got them on me. confidentia j."
okay.
"okay, houston, the antenna is up. it's aligned to 1644 and 525."
"we copy that, pete. you got the nominal align- ment."
that came out.
side screen came out very nice. okay.
popped right out. looks good.
"boy, are you dirty. i'm just as dirty. don't much want to stay down. okay. that first shape; i can't believe it."
"(laughter) they've got to be kidding. yes. boy, anytime you put anything spring-loaded on the moon, you're in trouble (laughter). this screen has got sort of - you know - a spring to it?"
(laughter).
doesn't want to lie down much up here in this gravity.
"okay. houston, how long we been out?"
"pete, you've been out 2 plus 40, and the pacing one right now is al. you're running around 20 minutes behind. and when you can, we'd like an _u check, and if you'd give us your 02 readings?"
okay. my 02 reading is 50 percent. and have you got anything for us? haven't heard too much from you.
negative on that. you're perking along real well. and we're following your progress. it looks as though you're getting the job done.
"okay. look - how you doing, al?"
i'm doing good. iconfidenti
okay.
that little thing just doesn't want to z _
"houston, let me ask you a question. can i push in the shorting amp thing?"
"that's affirmative, pete. we understand you're not able to get a reading. so, go ahead and close it - -"
ail right. it might - -
and we'll stand by for a zero reading.
"- - okay, it might be full-scale high."
"hey, you'd better tell them i still haven't put the side down."
"that doesn't make any difference, does it?"
i don't know.
"it's all connected. it's all connected. does it make any difference, houston?"
stand by.
you're a big-area litterbug? you know that?
i know it.
"pete, we'd like you to go ahead and get the full deployment down first before you depress the shorting amps."
"okay. boy, you're dirty all the way to you knees. can i give you any help?"
sure could.
all right; here i come.
"and, pete and al, a comment on picture taking. if you would, try to document some of the dirt which you've - which has gotten over - all over the equipment. if you would, try to get closeups pag1e96 5 which will show the dirt we might have on thermally sensitive areas. and, also, when you get done, if you would, take one or two extra pictures showing the alsep with the mounds that you described previously in the background. that'll give us a good geometric reference."
okay. i did a pan -
"hold it - hold that, pete."
i did a pan out here at the -
"okay. just a second. now, let me hold this end and you stretch that end out."
okay. i got it.
go to the right. that's it. get the ... get the coils out of it.
which way's this thing head?
it's got to head away from - central station - away from everything. probably ought to point right over there.
"okay. 04 21 50 49 hmp but, now, i think if you kind of twirled it a couple times, it would end up uncoiling that twist in the line there."
that's right. let me try it that way again.
"looks like it might be working. that's good. that's doing good. okay. let me take and set this thing down, and it's supposed to point to the earth this way. that'll be good."
got your ground wires wrapped around the leg.
"yes, i know. got it. looks like it's going to be okay."
"yankee clipper, houston. onfident."
"yankee clipper, if you'll give po0 and _ccept, we'll ship you up a state vector, a target load, and a refsmmat."
"okay. hold on, hold on. don't tip over."
roger.
"now, wait a minute, wait a minute."
okay. 04 21 51 h8 cdr i got it steadied.
okay.
"there, that's all right."
just hold it there and twist it.
"watch it, watch it, watch it."
okay. i'm trying to.
"no, your foot's hung in it. that a boy."
that did it. okay. let me sneak it back on again. okay.
"now, what do you want?"
i want to put that lid back on there. it would probably be best if we just left it off.
i think it would be best if you left it alone.
"okay. now, if you hold it there while i - -"
... i got it. i got it anchored.
- - because this is going to want to turn it over.
yes. i know.
"yankee clipper, houston. we're coming up with a load. age198 iconfidentirajj. ,"
yes. step on it.
okay. that's what i think i can do. no.
"they've got to be kidding about that cable. i've been - they knew that thing was going to do that. 04 21 52 51 _ there, maybe that's better."
"come on, this thing's making us run behind."
"i know it, but i don't see any way to quickly - (laught er)"
"ail right, now, just a minute. your foot. that's better."
"okay. make it turn - let's try it a couple more times. i think if i hold it this way and use this tool, i can probably set it - -"
"hey, it's just like zero g; everything floats up. that baby's going to nose dive into the dirt every time, sure as i'm standing here. that cable's cleverly designed to make it do that."
let's put it like this. down like that. 0_ 21 53 33 cdr don't fall over. 04 21 53 35 i_mp okay. there's no way.
"uh-uh, just - that a boy."
that thing goes right in the dirt each time - -
"i know, i know. it's going to do that. it's very frustrating. turn it around and point it the other way. see if it'll - see if it'll point out that way."
"ail right. that might be good, too. okay."
do - i knew that ding-a-ling cable was going to make us spend hours trying to do that.
(laughter) doesn't that make you mad? i onfjdenti
"yes. i know - especially when you know it's going to happen. ok 21 54 12 lmp look, why can't i set it like this? you just let go of the side and come over and step on that thing."
"hey, if this side falls over, then i'm really going to he mad. i got that thing firmly planted."
"just a minute. wait, wait. hold - hold it. hold her a minute. okay. get this just arranged. that's it. now, step on it."
"i can't. here - there's no way. let go of the - let go of the string in your hand. that a boy; now, bend -"
it's just - -
... that's it. push it in.
ah! we made it. i hope. let's push it real hard in there.
okay.
i think we've got it licked.
that a boy. easy does it.
"oh, you - that thing just jumps right up."
(laughter)
"pete, i'm just afraid that one - we've had it on this one."
"we've had it on that one, all right."
"hey, here it is here. look, i don't think it makes any difference if it - if it lays on its side as long as it points its aperture in the right place."
"yes. 04 21 55 15 _ let's move it around here and just let it lay on its side. yes, it doesn't know - it doesn't know the difference. let's just kind of lay it around. let's turn it - now, that'll be - that'll work; that 'll work."
that work right there?
"al, we concur with that. go ahead."
"okay. it looks like the only way this - this cable has just got too much spring for the - for the - the weight of the package, and there's just no way. okay, pete. let her go. now, let me level it. no way."
"that's a shame. what time is it, anyhow? let me get over here and get a big picture of this."
"pete, you're 2 plus 48 into the eva."
okay. level this_ pete. that's leveling good. leveling real good.
"that american flag sure looks pretty back here next to the lm, doesn't it? the s-band - looks like a model."
yes. i think that's going to do it for the side. that was a tough one ...
back off; i got the picture.
... you got a cross-sun?
no. let me get - i'm just getting one from a distance here ...
"al, copy you have the side deployed."
"yes. everything's deployed. i'm going to go get the shorting plug now, houston."
okay. standing by.
"(h_mming) boy, do i like to run up here. this is neat."
yes. it is fun. onfidential
"the first thing we've got to do is run ever to that volcano-looking - whatever that little jobber-do is. that's interesting. okay, houston. here comes the shorting plug."
"yankee clipper, houston. the computer is yours."
"... astr0 switch 17 hey, al."
"yes, sir."
i need your help over here after a minute.
i'll be there.
"houston, how about astro switch 17"
"you're clear to rotate astro switch 1, pete."
okay.
okay.
okay.
"0kay. gosh, we can't - we've got to realign that antenna."
"okay, houston. astro switch 1 is rotated; short- ing amp switch is in. i'll be a happy man if you tell me you're getting a signal."
"boy, it's all put up."
"roger, pete. stand by."
it sure looks nice.
how about - how about messing with this one thing right here_
"okay. well, we'll do it, pete. let's - let's - i wanted to just look at the numbers with you, too. hey, would you just do me a favor? use your tongs and pick up a couple of these boyd bolts and set them on the edge of that skirt - ... the seismic. there's about 10 boyd bolts just near it over there. what did you want me to look at? onfidential 5"
just check - check that antenna; make sure it's level.
okay.
"okay, i'm ... you do that. i'll give you the tongs. i'm going to run over and photograph this ding-a-ling looking -"
all right.
"houston, how long you going to let us stay out?"
"pete and al, - -"
go ahead.
"pete and al, houston. looks like you did the job. we're getting data hack."
"hey, that's - you don't know how happy i am."
okay. tell me again the ... numbers you're supposed to use.
"16445.25. here, turn around."
okay.
"i shouldn't have done that ... dirty all over, here. 04 21 59 59 _ okay."
"all right, i'm going over to this mound."
okay.
i'll be hack in a flash. by-by.
okay. i'll tell you the numbers i read; you tell me if they're right.
okay.
"i read 52 - no, no, correction - i read 525."
that's right.
okay. i also read - 16 - 42. onfideni. t r
i don't know what this thing is. it's really weird.
1642. you ever - is that - is that it?
"1644, al."
"okay. same thing. looks good, looks good."
i don't know what this is. let me get the - ... feet at f:8.
"yankee clipper, houston. go ahead."
that's affirmative. we'll be up with you in about 2 minutes.
i know what it is.
what is it?
"well, i think that rock - i think it's - it's just a little secondary impact crater. very funny ... boy, is that a funny rock - it looks -"
"yankee - yankee clipper, houston. i have the maneuver pad when you're ready to copy."
"hey, here's a rock they'll be glad to see in houston."
good.
it's an interesting one. it looks like a solid glass chunk - -
"oh, yes?"
"- - shiny black material, i've never seen anything like it before."
"***lunar orbit plane change l, sps/g&n: 36733; minus 0.73, plus 0.51; 119:47:12.54; minus o011.5, plus 0349.6, minus all balls; roll, pitch, and yaw, all zeros; 0062.5, plus 0057.3; 0349.7, 0:18, 0337.1; 05, 002.6, 18.7."

"and that's down, 007; right, 46. the remainder is na."
"hey, pete, let me put this rock in your pack. · .i m"
sirius and rigel.
- - glass spatter on it. that's fantastic. never seen anything like that rock.
"for your alignments, 047, - -"
"no, i haven't. no, i haven't."
that's great.

"hey, are you - are you through, al?"
yes. i - i got - i got some pictures to take and that 's it.
"well, you take some pictures, and i'll meet you over at that big mound. ail right?"
ail right. sounds good.
ail right.
"clipper, go ahead."
"going to bring the tongs, al."
"okay. unless you want them, right now."
"okay, clipper. understand. you did not copy all of that pad. is that affirm? jonftde .ntia"
"okay. boy, is that a big rock!"
"okay, al. what are you up to?"
i'm coming your way. let's start sampling.
okay.
i'll he there in a minute.
"houston, how long you going to let us stay out?"
"hello. hello, houston?"
"al, houston. go ahead."
okay. how long you going to let us stay out?
"pete, you'll be extended 30 minutes_ so, you're out for a total of 4 hours."
"all right, how much do we have?"
"and it looks as though you're - okay. you've got about 1 hour left, and it looks as though we're going to have to close off pretty much with the nominal plan; and stand by; we have some words on the traverse back."
okay. we're standing over at the head crater.
"why don't we start picking up some rocks, pete, while we wait? yes?"
yes. yes. yes.
want to get a picture of that?
sure do.
let me get it set up.
right.
"... and f:8. okay. there you go. okay. grab her up, pete."
"pete and al, two things we'd like you to do on the traverse on the way back: one is to get samples and some documentation of those mounds; and secondly, if you can, get over to the 1000-foot crater, which is northwest of the alsep, and get samples and documentation of that sample from there."
1000-foot crater?
suppose that's where we are? is that one - that one over there?
"you don't mean the head crater, do you? let's get some of this mound al."
okay.
it's an interesting thing. there's a little vent hole.
"negative. we'll - if you're at head crater now, we'll give you - we'll give you a radar vector. stand by."
"... this way. you're - you've already got pictures of the - this, pete?"
yes_ at 15 feet. i'm just taking it close up over here.
okay. take that at about - -
"go get the - look at this black rock, here."
okay. wait. let me get close - wait - wait. uh-oh. that - that ruins it.
i got it; i got it; i got it.
yes_ but i didn't get a picture of it. okay.
of that one? yes. okay?
"there, you old picture in there. let's get another one from right here ... this one - eonfidenti"
let's go around to the other side and not kick any dirt on it. it ruins it.
yes. okay; go ahead.
go.
"pete, houston. the crater which we speak of is - pete, the crater which we speak of is about 300 feet northwest of head crater."
the head - oh - i see it. yes. you mean the great big one over here? okay. yes. we can go over there.
that's affirmative.
"we can go over these, but that's the - -"
"wait, wait, wait a minute."
huh? 04 22 10 08 _ try a piece of that.
"and, pete and al, we'll be - talking with yankee clipper, giving him a maneuver pad, for about the next 5 minutes. 04 22 t0 16 cdr very good."
"let me see if i can chip some of that off, pete, with this. get my tool here. i know - you could work 6 or 7 hours here; never bother you a bit - a bit ..."
right. okay.
i'm going to knock a piece of that off.
"(_mming) you know, i've got the feeling that when that crater was made, it just threw out a big blob of dirt. this is where it landed."
yes.
ain't any that big. pag2e08 i'confident day
"hey, you'd almost - i wouldn't be surprised to find this is that microbreccia; you haven't got any - -"
"hey, let me get a picture. let me get a picture of that one."
okay. that'll be a goodie.
"pete and al, houston."
go.
go ahead.
we're trying to get a maneuver pad up to clipper; he's having a hard time copying it with you talk- ing in the background. could you - could we have some silence for about - -
okay.
- - for about 5 minutes_ while we get that p_ up? okay. we'll be right back with you.
"pete and al, we're back with you."
okay.
roger-roger. we're almost over to the 1000-foot crater.
roger.
"got - got about another 200 feet to go. you can see these linear patterns quite frequently on the surface, houston. they are - seem to generally run from the north to the south, and they're just little lines. they're off in the dirt; sometimes you see a large area - we're in an area right now. it looks like it had a fresh impact not too long ago."
"let me take a picture of this one, pete. this - -"
"hey, i got some neat - neat ones right here. iconfident-i"
okay. looks like a secondary impact crater that occurred - recently.
"yes. some of them do, don't they?"
they do. this one looks like fresh - doesn't have that old look like all the rest of these - -
come on. let's go.
there's some of that ... in the bottom of there.
"roger, pete and al. we copy that. we show you're 3 hours and 7 minutes into it - into the eva. and we'd like you back to the lm to start the closeout in l0 minutes. that's ad 3 plus 17."
okay.
"holy christmas, we're going to have to smoke there, houston."
"well, we're there, now."
yes. we're almost to the crater.
that's affirmative.
"okay, we'll - we're not getting very many rocks by going this far, but if that's what you want, that's what you want. run, baby (laughter)."
"hey, let's - when we start picking up, let's try and get a larger sample - -"
"hey, look at - this looks like a brilliant spank- lng fresh impact crater. look at that little fellow, huh?"
"sure does, doesn't he?"
"yes. let's get some rocks right here; here's some. here, get some pictures first. get some pictures of that crater, and i'll get some over there. i'll get this one right here. age (tonfident s"
okay. wonder why these look so fresh? must be just the difference in materials.
"boy, it sure does look fresh though, doesn't it?"
there - there's a rock for you.
okay.
"listen, we need to find a grapefruit, too, you know. 04 22 16 46 l_ yes. there's a bunch around."
made a dent on this rock. whoops. wait a min- ute; i dropped it. hold it; move on a little bit. move on; move forward.
okay.
don't like hustling. i'll be dobbed! let's go. 04 22 17 02 ia_ okay.
"get right to the edge of this crater and photo- graph it. get a pan in it, and then we won't have to come back this way. look at there; that crater's spectacular, isn't it? wow, a monster! look at that rockx i'd like to -"
oh ... get some of this bedrock - -
"well, we may want to go back there tomorrow, but we can't go any further. we'll never get back in 10 minutes."
"hey, there's bedrock down here, a little ways."
where?
it's right down the hill.
"hey, you're right."
about 50 - 50 yards.
here i go. c fideni
"hey, good show."
you're right. i'll pan it first. got just a minute. i'm going to get in here and - you get to go to intermediate cooling.
okay.
"been around here so far on min. 04 22 17 49 _ yes, let's ... -"

huh?
"got it. i was just looking over this rock, down here. looks like it came - -"
just a minute.
"okay. now, let me go over here, and i'll get one in stereo of this baby."
okay.
let me just leap over here a ways.
"houston, we're looking down into this big crater now, and it looks rather old .... - -"
"hey, there's some bedrock on the bottom, i think, · here. looks like big boulders."
"there's some big boulders that are resting inside the rim. none on the rim like we see on a large crater that's further to the west by another 1000 feet. but you don't see any outcroppings of rocks either that - you know - that we could look down and say, well, from the top of the rim down to about 20 feet or something, then we come to the - the underlying rock, but there is this rock that's very large, an arm's spread around. we're going to try to collect some of the samples."
"hey, i'm going to get the - -"
we can get them here - -
"roger, al. we suggest that you hustle. we show you're 3 hours - 3 hours and 11 minutes_ and we'd like you back there around 17 - 6 more minutes. tconfidenti"
"we're picking up a couple right now, and we're on our way back. just a minute."
"boy, there's a big block over there."
i can't get it?
you got it?
i can't get it with the tongs.
"hold my hand, and i'll pick it up."
"hey, wait a minute. how about this?"
"get it? 04 2220 13 cdr push it over here, and i'll get it."
push her over here.
okay ... 04 22 20 25 _ drop it in my bag.
okay. you got anything else you want to put in your bag? got to push another one over here.
"okay, in just a minute."

yes.
"okay. we're getting you some of this rock, hous- ton; i hope it's a - sufficient. let's go back and pick up another kind. where the heck is the lm?"
"roger, pete and al_ we copy. we suggest you start smoking on back there. you're 3:13, and i'd like you back there in 4 minutes."
"okay. we're on our way. let's go, al."
"hey, pete?"
yes.
let me ask you something.
what?
what -
huh?
"that's interesting, isn't it?"
when?
"i was looking at that rock perched right over on top of the hill, there .... my distance here, because there's nothing but -"
here.
- - all the same.
yes.
... the same.
"must have been 1200 - 1300 feet, huh?"
at least.
at least. you could travel a lot further than that; you know it? onfidentta
yes.
you could really make a long traverse if you had a good long-term ops.
what do you figure my strides are - 10 feet?
"no. i'd say your - each - each step only goes about - when you're running normal, i'd say they'd go about 3 or 4 feet, but you could just go in- definitely at this pace."
yes.
you don't get tired. seems that you land flat- footed and then you just push off.your toes and - then you go.
(laughter)
"fun! well, we got that alsep up."
"listen. when i get this rock box, we've got to get some more rocks. turned us all around, and we didn't get any rocks."
i'm getting some up here.
we'll fill it. just a minute.
"hey, houston. we're approaching the alsep, headed back to the lm."
"roger, pete. we copy."
if you hadn't made me run all the way -
"who, me?"
yes.
"hey, ease over this way a little."
which way?
over towards your left. jconfidentt_ it 5
what you want to do?
i thought there were a couple of good rocks over there. there.

that's great.
"hey, pete."

"boy, there's a lot of soft land here."

"roger, pete. we copy."
there's a good rock.
"halt, halt, halt!"

and i'll get the rock box out.
all right. real good.
"hey, houston. we're back at the lm."
"roger, al, pete. we copy. after you get finished with the core tube, al, we'll have some instruc- tions for you with the tv."
"sounds good. okay, pete. where are the tongs for a moment?"
the tongs are on the mesa.
okay.
they are?

(laughter) good show (laughter).
"copy your record of core tube depth, and you've probably got the record for swinging pieces of alsep across the lunar landscape."
"and would you believe, i've found a use for the big scoop. 04 22 36 21 _ okay, here comes the core tube."
okay.
"got the cap ready, pete?"

"hello, houston. how do you read?"
"what happened to them? you all ready for me to come in, al?"
i'm ready. it's up to them.
wonder what happened to houston.
"i'm not sure that that lunar stay didn't do it. i'd rather go back on track and get them back. of course, we've got fuller signal strength."
"intrepid, houston. stand by."
"okay, what's your problem? pag2e40 confidentiabl 5"
"okay, we had a changeover from one site to another, down here. it was all on our end. no problem with your antenna. it's working well."

i can't believe i did that.
"yes, you did. because i remember, you were hitting here and then when i backed up, i could - i'll tell you - we probably just ought to put a piece of tape over it."
okay. that's my feedwater.
"we broke through the skin on the hatch, and for about a 10-inch cut, there; and it didn't hurt the insulation, didn't hurt the hatch, and i don't know whether you want us to put a piece of tape on there or just forget it. it doesn't look like it's going to bother anything."

"okay, houston, i looked - i'm looking at the con- trast chart in the shadow; and, as i mentioned at 3 feet, i can see all six. if i back up maybe to 10 feet, as long as i stand here a moment and adapt nv eyes, i can see all six also. now, the thing that seems to have the biggest effect on it is how low the sun is. the sun is high now and so i don't have to squint my eyes particularly, looking in that direction. yesterday, looking into the same crater, even though it wouldn't be any darker in there because the sun was there, i could - i would never be able to adapt. right now, i can see all six marks, and i've taken the photographs. going to go out and do solar wind now ."
i can't see a lot of difference in visibility -
"roger, al. 05 12 07 26 l_ the only major difference i've noticed is the fact that when you're out here on these - this area, if you look cross-sun, the moon appears one color; if you look down-sun, it's another; if you look up-sun, it's another. but looking into shadows or anything else like that, it's pretty much the same as on earth."
"copy that, al. 05 12 07 58 _,_ okay, i'll take some pictures here of the solar wind for you. 05 12 08 13 _p it doesn't look as pronounced, wrapped around the pole now that i get out here, houston. it - looks pretty much like yesterday, just sort of, i guess it was sort of an optical illusion from inside the spacecraft. i took a couple of pictures of it, but i don't think there's anything unusual going on there."
"roger, al. and, pete, if it's convenient, and you can find another rock there and give her a heave, experiments sure would like to see another one. 'confidenti ab"
"okay, i was setting up my rock hole and all that - good things for the polarizing light. and - say, i was looking at a rock that has small crystals in it. one of them is shining very, very bright green, like ginger-ale-bottle green."
"okay. al, are you on your way?"
that's affirm; i'm now making sure that everything is in the tool box - handtool carrier here.
okay.
"i'm mounting them pretty firmly. hey, houston? as i was working around the handtool carrier a moment ago, the canvas bag came loose. it took me about 2 minutes to put it back together again; it came off the metal sides. and it looks like those clips that hold it on are going to be com- pletely inadequate, and i expect that we're going to have some trouble with it all day today. we ought to think about fixing it before next time."
"roger, al. we copy that. do you think once you put a little weight in it, she'll hold better?"
"i don't know; they don't - the - they don't seem to have a lot of friction on the sides there, and the bag just floats around it. it needs to be more firmly attached some way."
okay.
roger.
al?
"yes, sir."
where are you?
i'm just leaving the lm.
okay.
"boy, this handtool carrier is - is light and nice. compared to carrying it around on earth i think rag2e80 ',confidential da6y it's going to be - we might be able to just slip it right down inside the surveyor crater with us. piece of cake. okay, i see you over there; i'm on the way. oh, don't tell me, you ding-a-ling camera. man."
"i can see anything - everything from fine-grain basalt as i come running across the area here, to - coarse - a few coarse-grain ones; i see some - sort of light reddish-gray colored rock that i would call - i don't know really what i would call it; it looks almost like a granite, but, of course, it probably isn't, but it has the same sort of texture. the individual components - constituents, so to speak, are crystals, but it still has that same appearance. they'll have a chance to examine one closer."
"roger, al. we copy that. and, pete, can we give you any help with that camera?"
i got it going - just fine.
roger.
"i'm taking the polarized pictures right now - but al, when you get up to me, if you'll just stop up-sun at 15 feet and take that shot of what i'm shooting at, 11 15, two pictures; one before, one after. 05 12 12 32 lr_ okay, let me take something out of this crater hole, pete. it's sort of unusual; it's got a lot of those little droplets on it, those blips. but - but the - the fragments in this crater looks different from - the others. take a couple of quick pictures, then i'll be right with you."
okay. it's all working out just fine.
get me a stereopair of this. good. we'll use the tongs here and i'll pick it up.
"it's right exactly - this is a very small crater, houston, probably about 3 feet in diameter and looks like it was made at - not very fast-moving or energetic or heavy/ projectile. yet, right in confidential, the middle of the hole is some of these glass- covered rock fragments. and, on some of the other rocks that seemed to be rested in the hole, i'm putting them all in a - sample bag 1 here, i mean - some of the others don't have any coating on them at all. i'm picking them up with the tongs, but i can't tell how strong they are but they don't seem - they don't seem to hold together too well; they seem kind of weak. there you go. now, i'll head on over where pete is."
"roger, al. we copy that. if you're going to document that, try to get some of the material around the glass as well as the glass itself."
"okay. i want to - i'll just get this as a bonus, and i want to get over here to start working with pete as a team, here. just didn't want to have to try to remember where that was."
roger.
"you're going to get a big surprise when you look into this head crater, al. it's a beck of a lot deeper than it looks."
okay.
"here's a nice white, small crater - a white rim on it, about a 5-foot diameter one."
"i've been concentrating, houston, as i came walk- ing over here to head crater, to see if there were any possible changes in either texture, slope, color, anything you could think of or anything that i could think of, that would say to me that i was walking on a different surface than i was when i started. and i can't - haven't seen a thing yet; it all looks the same - it all looks like it's covered with this - black rock."
"slow up. don't - don't - don't kick dust in the middle of my polarized picture area, here."
okay. i'll stop right here. rage cqnfidential: bay6
"okay. put the tool carrier down and get - get your up-sun pictures. you see where my footsteps are, that rock that's half buried and the two rocks that i've turned over in my footsteps?"
yes.
"okay, it's 15 feet, f:ll, two shots - now, you're not going to get the before, unfortunately. 05 12 15 _4 lmp okay. how about right - better have my shadow here or over there?"
"no, that's the pile, right there. see where my - see where i turned over the two rocks alongside the great big rock, where my foot tracks are? 05 12 15 56 l_ on yes, way down there at the end."
"no, right here. i'll walk over to it. 05 12 16 02 _p that's a good idea."

"okay, got those two. got a couple of pictures there, houston. let me tell you what my camera reading is now, and then we can try to keep up with it from time to time. next time, i'll come over here by pete and we'll - -"
"yes, houston, i've shot three - six - nine - 12, 15 - 15 pictures."

roger. we're watching.
i didn't quite kick it hard enough; wait 1 and i'll do it again.
"and, houston, that sample bag that i put the fragments in that i memtioned earlier, that i found in the bottom of that small crater?"
mark.
that's sample bag 1-d.
"copy your mark, al, or pete, and 1-d on that sample bag."
"you know, it's a funny thing, houston, in one- sixth g, these - even though slopes are steep and everything, these rocks just don't want to go anywhere."
"okay, pete. i need you to - -"
"roger, pete. we haven't been able to pick it up on the pse here."
"okay, that was too small a rock."
"- - take the filter off the front of my camera, would you?"
okay. let me set this down.
and you might want to take the ... tools in a second.
okay. here's your camera. filter's off.
"okay. that's it for the filter. goodness, that thing goes."
"okay. okay, i've got a rock over here."
okay. onfid t/i#ii 6
_at are we supposed to get here?
"we probably ought to come over here to the other side; it looks the best, and do a little trench, and compare some of the soil profiles."
"okay, they wanted it - look, itve got an area right over here that looks like a good area to work in. okay?"
"these little white spatterlike craters; it looks like they're very fresh impact, like that little one right there."
yes_ that's a good idea.
"let me go over here; there's three in a row, and let's work this area a little bit, which is the corner of head crater they wanted us to work."

deep?
"yes, dig as deep as you can, then get me a sample right out of the bottom, because this will be something new. i'll put it in sample bag number 5-d."

okay. onfiden .
okay. that's good.
"okay. as you move off, pete, every once in a while, i can see some white; but, most of the time - hey, you kicked over a rock that had a white bottom - quite a bit different than the top. right behind you; you might - you might want to take a picture of that. it's quite a bit dif- ferent than those others."
houston. you're going to have to budget our time now. how long do you want us to spend it - in head crater?
because it looks like we could just spend all our time here if we wanted to - -
that's what's bothering me; we could do that any place right here on the moon.
"pete, we show that you're 58 minutes into the eva, and we'd like to get you over to bench crater, and leaving there something on the order of 1 plus 12; we can slip that a bit. so, we sug- gest you finish up where you are - what you're doing there at head and move on."
"okay. al, where's the map?"
"got the map right here, pete. let you take a look at this."
"by the way, this is the smartest idea we came up with, houston; this map just works great out here."
"okay, let me take a picture of this rock. i'm going - -"

"now, houston, do you want head crater - from triple craters? is that what you want or do you want the triple craters?"
"pete, we suggest you just move on to bench - and a comment on that double core tube; if you find a spot that looks soft, go ahead and sink the double core tube."
"we'll do it at bench. it's really a shame, houston - -"

the big one.

"al, did you get some off the far side - of that?"
"yes, let's get that. that's a good idea. ail the rocks we've been looking at, houston, in this area, seem to be the same. they seem to have a - the rock has got dirt built up on all sides of it, all directions."
"sure does; looks about equal too, doesn't it?"

"here's something here. go ahead. i want to look here, for a second. 05 12 36 34 l_ if you look real closely at the rock, the surface of it is coarse pitted and there's some pits that are maybe even up to three-eighths of an inch in diameter on it; however, most of them are small. it doesn't look like a basalt, although the grains are too small for me to see anything - identify any specific one. some of the pits have glass in it, which is not too surprising_ and many of them don't. that's about all we can say about that rock, houston, and that's typical of the - of the ones in this area."
"roger, al. could you give us a sample bag number and then press on? 05 12 37 t8 lmp okay. well, we didn't take a sample there. the couple that we did take a sample of previously are the same types, so the last couple of samples have been of the same type rocks that we're dis- cussing. _ 12 37 130 cdr okay, houston, i'm coming up on bench crater right now. i loped off and left al. and i'll get you a pan in bench crater. this looks like a very in- teresting crater; it's different. oh, and i see some really different rocks - a big one. hey, that looks like bedrock. gee, what a cra_er. wow. oh, boy. hey, al, look at - come on over here. 05 12 38, 01 _.2_ i'm corning. 15 1'2 35 03 cdr ougiit to get some of this. let me get some cans in there. 0 12 35 10 cc sounds interesting, al. and, pete, sounds as though 'you're getting down to bedrock. is that affirm? 2,5 l_ 28 13 cdr yes. they got to be bedrock, and this one in the bottom is - as a matter of fact - - c 12 38 19 _ _oy, there's some big fragments around here. 2,51f 38 20 cdr - - get the pictures, it looks to me like stuff is melted in the bottom of it. i - can't swear that, but i'll get you some pictures. starting right now. f:8 - b - i - fix. okay. let me go ever on the other - little bit here. get you a good p._. 05 12 38 53 _._ yes. this rock looks pretty much the same from a distance, houston. c5 12 39 _jo _r yes, there's - - 2,5 12 39 01 _._/cdr soil."

"what do you suppose that is? 05 12 42 02 _ hey, we can't - here's something interesting, houston. hey, it looks like a surface - what we got is what looks like kind of a semiburied rock. hey, there's a small piece of it over there to the left. see it, pete? we'll be able to catch it and put it in the bag."
yes.
see that over there?
yes.
"what it looks like is a - a buried rock, not unlike the others around here, except it appears to have some sort of coating on it that's very iridescent. a lot of crystals shining in it - -"
i'll tell you what's happened is it - it - it's been laying in the ground and it's been hit by another fragment.
think so?

sample in sample bag ... - the numbers.
"copy, 7. and would you go ahead and give us some picture numbers, also?"
okay. we'll give you some in just a minute. pete's picking up a small piece of this rock. maybe you could get a piece that's fractured right off the middle.
"that's what i wanted to do. 05 12 43 06 _ okay. let me get out of your way so you can see it. let me hand you the scoop - there it is, right there. okay."
it's got an interesting coating on it; it's dif- ferent from what we've seen. maybe this is more newly exposed - struck ...
is that all you want to put in that bag?
listen. hand me the scoop - -
okay.
- - let me get some of those glass beads and stuff there - -
ail right. let me get you the scoop.
"okay. how long have we been going, houston?"
"got it, pete. 1 plus 15."
"no, more than that."
"pete, we show you're 1 plus 14 into the eva, and we'd like you to move on from this crater at about 1 plus 27. if you could, then, go on down and take a look at the bedrock on the bench. nfidenti"
"hey, i - i'd better not put that in there; that's what we wanted to show, was the - - 05 12 44 01 _dr okay."
let me get you another sample bag.
i hate to try and get down to the bottom of this fellow; it's awful steep.
"yes, i don't think we want to do that."
"in fact, i couldn't get down in there."
let's forget that - -
okay. then hold off on that; don't go ahead.
but - but - but i'm going to get you -
negative on the request.
"- - we're trying to get you some of the bedrock; it looks like it's up in the lip here. ail of it looks the same - on the edge, houston."
i'm working on it; i'm working on it.
it's 8-d.
"ridiculous, pete!"
"what happened to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5?"
"(laughter) catch you another one, okay? what we're putting in here now, houston, is some soil that's right next to the rock that we previously described; in fact, pete's got a nice fragment of that rock that's going to end up in this bag, too. oh, catch that one."
oh - ooo.
that's a beauty. that thing is barely - a weak - it fractures right off - -
"(laughter) , confiden' ' 6"
"you've got to get some control there, babe; you're overpowering it. this one-sixth g up here, houston; you lift something up in your scoop; and, when you stop the scoop, it just keeps going up in the air."
i'll tong it (laughter) if i can't do it the other way.
"looked good, though. okay. put that in the bag. there you go."
we need to put more samples per - in the bag. 05 12 45 28 _ and they're saying they can't hardly use those little ones.
"they won't fit in it any bigger. 05 12 45 33 _ here, i'll get it."
okay.
thank you. okay?
okay. let's go over here and get some of this good rock. like bedrock to me.
okay.
"looks a lot like the fragments we've been seeing laying all over the place, but this stuff obvi- ously - i'll bet you we have a total of about 3 pounds of rocks right now."
okay. i'm with you.
okay. we're going to have to grab some bigger ... better ones.
got to dip down in the side of the crater there; see how it is going up and down - -
yes - it would be - down - -
"boy, this is interesting here; i want to get this area right here and see if i can't sample it - - onfidenti"
good move.
"- - if i don't fall down in the crater. go. that's a boy. well, this is different; look at this, al; this is different; we'll get some of this."
okay.
"al, houston. over."
"go ahead, houston."
"al, we'd like you to go to intermediate flow for a minute and a half. we'll give you a call."
okay. what's the problem?
we're looking at a slightly lower than nominal feedwater pressure.
okay. been cooling real fine. look at the glass all over those rocks.
yes. i need to -
i want to bring this back; look at it.
okay.
"here, let me put this - put that in there."
"if you fall, it's going to fall."
there you go.
hold it.
huh?
let me get up here. okay?
watch it - it - you're going to -
"okay. now, you're going to - i'm going to get a bunch of these. 306 'q4xtfiden 6"
let's do; let's get a bunch of them and then they'll - have any rocks to bring back.
doing the best i can. 05 12 48 o1 _ there you go; there's a good one. put that thing in here.
oh!
"except i'm closing the bag, but we'll make it work."
"i had to take that big piece right there .... of it got spattered glass or something all over it. 05 12 48 27 _ let's take it. why don't we take a big piece of it? and - sample bag - what's wrong with these sample bags, whether they're the - the round ones, or the square ones, or the flat ones, they're all the same size. what you need are sample bags - little ones for these and some big ones for the bigger rocks. okay, 9-b is the sample we just picked up and described, houston."
"okay. put this right in here, pete."
no. wait a minute; here's a better one.
"okay. now, we are working on sample bag - 10-b."
10-b. wait for me.
"roger. copy 10-b; and, on your way out, would you get that partial pan with a 75-foot base line?"
"we'll sure do that, houston - -"
"i already got the pan. 05 12 49 18 imp well, pete says he's already got it."
got a stereo partial pan. okay?
roger.
"okay. that's a good rock, and that fills that one up. qidnfiden"
"okay, pete, what's your next pleasure?"
"i don't know. what do you think, houston?"
you're looking in good shape. you can press on along the traverse over to sharp crater.
okay.
"why don't you take your - oh, you already got a snapshot of this, didn't you, pete?"
"wait, wait - sharp crater, that's funny; i can't locate it."
"here, let me - let me - show you the map, again."
"pete, from your present position, that's about 400 feet southwest."
"nice one, 400 feet south - -"
"- - al, it's got to be over that hill, right there."
about right there.
right here.
okay. let's try it.
400 feet southwest.
"all right. now, we want to get the core tube and that gas sample and a bunch of good things, right, houston?"
"that's affirmative, pete. all those good things at sharp crater."
got to find it first.
"oh, man, i got to just - -"
"al, you can go ahead and put that diverter valve to your choice. your feedwater pressure's holding even; looks as though it's working well. it's slightly lower than nominal."
"okay, houston."
"sharp crater, where are you? 05 12 51 13 _ got it pinpointed, pete?"
no. i can't find it.
"well, we're going in about the right direction."
"there's one right over here to - kind of more to your right. trouble is, i'm looking down zero phase, you know, and that's - there it is. that's got to be it, right there. 05 12 51 32 limp hey, i see it."
"boy, there's big fragments out here."
you can say that again.
have you got the shovel?
i sure do.
"good boy. no, that's not it either. 05 12 51 50 _ why don't we stop here and look at the chart a little bit more closely?"
"man, does that iailook small back there. i'll tell you what. i'd better get a tie anyhow. look at the chart."
okay.
okay.
okay.
"roger. are you going to give us a back-side sur- vey at that point, pete?"
"yes. i'll make it a full pan. so darn far out, i might as well. nftdientt"
"okay. a full pan over when you get to sharp. we show you are i plus 23 into the eva, and we're looking to leave sharp crater around i _lus 51, so you got lots of time."
we got to find sharp crater first.
"pete, i kind of agree with you; where is it?"
i don't know. we should be right here. i got a - how big is sharp crater?
looks pretty small. it looks to me to be about 30 meters.
okay. i got it. it's right here in front of me.
okay?
yes. that's it.
okay. load box - ...
this has got to be sharp crater right here. let's - we'll drive that double core tube in there.
ail right.
"yes. this has a nice white rim - a white rim on it. in fact, the rim of this looks pretty much like the area we kicked over on the previous craters. i'm not sure this is sharp crater, but it's - let's use it anyway, because it's the only one out here."
i know. i can see - nothing out here. darnedest thing i've ever saw.
"we're estimating a diameter of sharp crater, pete, for about 40 feet. 05 12 54 06 _ 40 feet, huh?"
"al, this may be it!"
this is it - it's got to be it. it's got a nice raised rim on it. pf_lrlr_rklti aj
yes. look at that.
"it's raised up about - what do you say, 2 feet? this is the same color as all that subsurface material."
it's awful soft in here; watch it.
okay.
holy christmas! look at the bottom of that.
"say, you know something, houston?"
"hey, houston. this crater looks like - -"
"go ahead, pete."
"- - blast effect coming out of it. looks like it's got blast effects radial all around. this has got to he fairly fresh to the - look at that, al. isn't that neat? i - we might get some pictures of that."
okay.
"i don't know what to set it on - 74, i guess. we're not that far away."
"boy, the - the rim is soft here, isn't it?"
sure is.
quite a bit softer than the others.we - -
but look at the radial spray pattern. look at that. i guess i'm supposed to drive the what - double core tube here or something?
yes. set that baby up. look at that - skip.
"we got to dig a trench? gas sample, we're out - -"
"al, we'd like to get the trench site sample there, and you can hold off on that double core tube until you get over to halo crater.  0 nfid j--."
"okay. good. we're supposed to look we_t for copernican rays here, too."
"houston, there's no way to tell the difference - from that that was there when - i mean, right on the surface before the crater was formed. there's no - there's no differentiation at all."
let's see. which sample do you want now?
that's the - deep trench - -
"al, we're looking for the trench site sample. that includes your environmental sample of trench and the gas analyses you can put in there, too."
okay. we'll do the whole smash here for you.
you want it right in the crater rim?
that's what it says.
okay. i get it. that's good.
"okay, let me get out - -"
"that's affirmative. that would be perhaps the easiest and best place to do it, and you can get that one core tube down in the bottom of the trench."
"yes, yes, yes."
"okay. pete, before you do that, help - you're going to have to llft this up so that i can take the sample out."
"wait 1. okay, i'll be right with you."
okay.
you going to do it right there?
yes. lift it up and i'll reach in there and grab the - put the - this will be the one for the soil here. age onfident:ha 6
"hey, one thing i've noticed, houston, carrying the - the tools and - but although your gloves - you don't feel any of the temperature here. turns out nice and bright, but it's nice and cool in here, except when you're carrying something metal, like the handtool carrier or the shovel or something. then your hand starts to get warm."
could you - could you get out of the -
yes.
could you just slide a little bit?
okay. let me slide right over here. that's a new one.
"oh, wait a minute. i've got to do it over here."
"hey, houston? did you take a picture before, al?"
"pete, go ahead."
no.
"oh. no - noth - nothing, houston; we're okay."
"i'll take one right now, pete."
"good spot right there, i believe."
"okay. go ahead, pete."
dig in that stuff.
wow!
you could drive three core tubes down there.
you sure could; it's soft.
yes. down about 8 inches.
yes. pete's digging in the - digging a nice clean trench.
"wait, wait, wait, wait. let me get the trench pictures. $onfid t l"
okay.
and i'm in the wrong setting as usual - -
"okay, al. could we have some numbers along with those pictures?"
"okay. we'll have to give them to you, houston. we've been delinquent there. fine gray. very fine soll here."
"okay, al. okay. i'm ready to - take - take - take a lo0k at my - what's the number? 05 12 58 44 i_ okay. you're on number 105."
"ow. pa 3e14 coj""tf!nti 6"
"that's okay. well, i'll trade cameras with you because you've been ..., okay?"
okay.
ail right. now what do you want to - want to do? fill that with dirt and - and rocks?
we sure do.
huh?
fill the big container with dirt.
okay.
be careful now - -
"pete, we copy you're on 105."
"wait a minute, wait. the tools didn't go in."
that's okay.
"that stuff is really funny. now, i can't see the trench and i know you can't."
that's - that a boy. yes. let's get organized. okay?
yes.
"and when you get it in there, try to tap it; maybe it will come out - -"
you got to come - got to come this way. 05 12 59 3h cdr okay.
"see, what's happening is my arm is being turned by the cables. there."
there.
"maybe you could grab the handles closer to the thingamajig there - - ,j ,nfiden- 05 12 59 h7 cdr yes."
- - when you lift it up. okay. we need some more. there you go. wait a minute.
there; that's the game.
wait a minute.
that's the game.
"yes, lost half of it that way."
"well, you still need some more - there; one more scoop ought to do it, though. ah, that's soft (laughter)."
watch yourself_ you're getting close to the crater.
(laughter) 05 13 00 15 i24p you get about 10 percent in there - -
... now?
"want to do more, or is that good?"
okay (laughter).
one more and you'll make it.
"(laughter) 05 13 00 32 _ that soil - i'll just have to - there isn't anything holding it together. it takes me back in my childhood when i just - you know, you wanted to fling things in every direction (laughter )."
"okay, that's it. bag's full. now, let me put the lid on."
i'm sorry_ but i (laughter) dropped this ... for the core tube.
"okay. can i help you with that? wait, wait, wait, wait. age tconft 6"
yes. why don't you? i'll hold this and you get the lid.
right here. 05 13 00 59 iac okay.
"let go. i got it. okay, you put the lid on."
ail right. here's the lid.
boy.
"right on the top. houston, this dirt came from about 8 inches down. wait a minute - -"
"copied. eight inches down, and what's the sample bag number on that?"
"this is the deep trench sample in the - doesn't fit right there - ail right - okay, - okay, on this? now, lower it."
isn't that ridiculous? 05 13 01 h4 laip done this a million times.
i'm just jamming on it. it's not sliding.
"i just made ..., i know. now, you hold it nice and tight."
"i'll tell you what's the matter, that thing - you're getting - getting friction. wait, wait. hold her tight."
"here, i'll get it."
here you go.
you got it.
no oil. suppose you're getting some vacuum welding? huh? 05 13 02 15 i24p no. that's okay. c nfidenti
that's it. put her down tight.
a little bit more.
"go ahead, that's a boy."
will you snap the top on?
okay.
that's a good top in that one. hold on. don't let go. good.
"okay. now, you need a core tube in the bottom of that trench. is that right, houston? okay. the tube's here - -"
"that's affirmative. and, al, when you get a chance, can we get your photo numbers?"
that's right - 50. and this is core tube num- ber 2.
"core tube 2 and i'll need the - there you go. ought to be a good place, pete. relatively fresh stuff here."
yes. you'd better believe it. very good. okay.
"this kind of ..., you could almost drive it with- out a hammer; but, if you'll hand it to me, i'll get - -"
just a second. i want to take a couple more shots of this before we leave. 05 13 03 21'lmp there. okay.
they're all in. i'll get the pictures.
all right.
"it's driving in real easy, houston."
go on; just drive her all the way. i can't lean down too far now.
roger. pag3e18 jonfide 6 05 13 03 38 _ and we're driving it all the way in pretty easy.
that a boy. wait 1. stop. that's it.
"okay. just a second; let's put this up. let me take a picture of it, pete - make sure we got it documented."
let's do.
there's the stereopictures.
okay.
ail right. this dirt's gotten on my camera and i can't see the settings anymore; i'm going to have to do something about that.
okay. you ready to put the top on this core tube?
you'd better believe it.
okay. here we come. i hope that soil stays in there.
see if it did.
probably did because it stayed in your scoop so well.
you'd better believe it. it's full.
okay.
come over here with it.
ail right. there you go. better.
good sample.
yes. it is. a good sample.
there you go.
"ah, got the cap on the can."
that a boy.
okay. just a minute. hunch. got it.
careful - -
okay?
- - put the scoop back on. all right? and i'll stow it.
"okay, houston. what else do you want here? just a little environmental sample?"
"okay. we show you should have gotten in the trench site sample, the core tube samples from the end - from the bottom, and also the gas analysis sample."
"okay. we need some little rock fragments from here, pete. you'll have to hold up the bag so i can reach it."
okay. just a second.
roger. that's surface rock fragments.
yes. we're going - going to get it; hold the phone.
better find it first. do you know where the ·.. went?
... just a little ...
i'll move it around and see if you see it.
yes. yes. stick your hand straight down. towards your knee; that a boy; you ought to have it.
got it; i almost got it.
some little rocks in here - -
"okay, just little rocks .... now, push it. 1 5 13 06 21 cc roger. copy. you got some rocks and the gas analysis and would also confirm that you've gotten the environmental sample?"
"pete, have you got the - - 05 lb 06 26 cdr we got the environmental sample, we got the trench and core tube, and i'm trying to find a little rock. little rock? there - there's a lot - -"
there's a neat one. there it is right there.
"ho-ho, just right for that little can."
give me a few.
thing has shrunk.
"here's a couple of nice ones right here, pete."
where?
see them?
"al, your plss feedwater is back up to nominal and all looks good."
"okay. thank you very much, houston. see those bright shiny ones there?"
"yes, yes, yes, yes."
"wait. let me get a shot of them. just move - just a second, pete."
okay.
okay. got a picture of them.
careful. these - there. how about those right - right there? there. right - there. see them shine?
the little ones?
"no, no. move over this way. this way. up - youire near about - right there."
"no. hey, that's a neat - oh, that's glass; look at that."
right next to it.
"yes, here. one at a time. be a good sample for them."
"and that piece right next to it, there."
okay.
"houston, how far are we from the lm?"
(laughter)
stand by.
... tricky; wish we had -
(laughter)
"hey, we need some more, pete. give me a bigger rock. there's not enough in there to do any - -"
"(laughter) hey, come on, i'm getting tired of picking up those little things."
there's nothing in there.
i can't - where is my stupid tool? there it is.
get a big one. there's one right there.
"get a big what? here, this one?"
yes.
i don't think that will fit.
let's try it.
"no, that won't - -"
no - ...
there's a good one.
pete and ai_ we show you 1200 feet from the lm.
"okay. come on, al, we're wasting time."
there you go.
"pete, as soon as you finish up there, you can head on back toward the east, towards halo crater. no need to go any further west."
"got it, pete?"
"yes. wait; let go a minute. 05 1308 50 cdr i'm with you, houston."
"hey, good show, pete; good turning."
there you go. the front of my lens is clean - relatively speaking. nothing else is.
okay. want me to put that up?
yes.
okay. we got it.
okay. give me one gnomon and my shovel. 05 13 09 20 _p here's your shovel.
head for halo crater.
"okay, pete. we'll give you a radar vector on this one."
that's good.
"if you'll go over - just directly east of bench crater, and you can continue on east until you're just about directly opposite the lm. and then a couple of more steps ought to take you right to halo crater. enti litr"
sounds like a pretty good vector. ?nat also says that we're running right into the sun. does that agree with you?
"that's affirmative. you will be running right into the sun; and directly at your 9 o'clock posi- tion, you'll see the lm; a couple of more steps and you'll be right there."
"i've got the lm in sight to my 10 o'clock. you know what i feel like, al?"
what?
did you ever see those pictures of giraffes running in slow motion?
that's what i feel like.
- - that's exactly what i feel like (laughter).
"say, would you giraffes give us some comment on your boot penetration as you move across there, what you're doing now, and what you had back there at sharp crater? 05 -310 30 lmp oh, it's much firmer here. we don't sink in anywheres near as much. now, i'm crossing some of my own tracks."
yes.
"the toes sink in a bit, pete, as you push off. you land flat-footed so your heels don't sink in; but, as you push off with your toes, they sink in down about 3 inches. your heels are only sunk in - perhaps an eighth of an inch. also, right as you kick off on your toe - -"
"roger. thank you, al."
"- - every time he lands he sends a - little par_ ticles spraying out ahead of him and beside him and everywhere else, and they go out to distances maybe - maybe 2 feet to 3 feet around him."
"okay. we're back at bench crater. now, have we gone too close towards the lm?"
"going on the south side of bench crater, houston."
"okay. now, if you'll just go directly to the east of the center of bench crater and then con- tinue directly east right into the sun; and then at 9 o'clock, you'll see the lm, and a couple of more steps and you'll be there."
okay.
i've got the decided feeling i'm going to sleep tonight.
"pete, the crater you're looking for, halo crater, is just about the same size as sharp crater and should resemble it."
"i think z have it in sight, but i'm not sure. there's a couple of them here. i'll tell you what i'm going to do, houston; i'm going to take an emu break. how you doing, al?"
okay.
"pete, the dimension on halo crater is about 20 feet, so that would make it half of what you saw at sharp."
"okay. now, halo. i wonder if i'm standing - you suppose this is it, al?"
"well, it doesn't have any halo around it."
"yes, i know. but you never can tell from here."
you can look at the map when you get here.
tell you one thing i'd go for is a good drink of ice water.
"quit thinking that. let me look in the map, pete."
okay.
i can't imagine them seeing this one from - - omfident l-
"pete and al, can we have an emu check?"
you sure could.
"and one way to locate it, also, is that it should be right on the rim of surveyor crater, and you ought to see surveyor off directly to the north- east."
"okay. i - i - i know where we are. an emu check, mine reads about 55 percent 02, houston."
"mine reads 55 02 also, houston. just beautiful - -"
copy. fifty-five both.
"round glass ball they got to have, al. quarter of an inch."
and the sample bag.
coming. coming.
look at that.
"okay; just a second. first time i've worked up a heart rate, i think."
okay.
this is sample bag ll-d.
i didn't take a picture. i just wanted to - -
okay. watch that crater behind you; don't step back.
wait a minute.
this is glass beads. 05 13 14 50 kmp i know. i was thinking of this. we got a total now of about 5 pounds of rocks.
okay.
i'd hate to - i'd hate to have us get back to the lm and then have to fill it up around here again.
"ah, we're going to the surveyor crater."
okay. 05 13 15 oh cdr ... get to the bottom of that baby.
why don't you take a rest here?
yes. 05 13 15 08 'lmp funny. do - do your hands get hot holding that shovel?
"my hands just get hot, period. i guess - ! don't know whether it is the shovel or what."
"you know, as long as it - like now, mine are cool. but the minute i start carrying this tool carrier, they start warming up. wouldn't think the thing would be that hot."
"yes. yes - i - i'll tell you what - let's see, we're cross-sun, right? look over here at me and smile."
okay. have a picture. you're right there by a crater.
there's the lm. right in the background. great. there you go.
ail right. let's - let's ease off at a nice - -
okay.
- - at a slower pace. just like you're going now. i think this is halo crater right up here in front of us.
"hey, ed, you might tell fred haise he ought to quit working on running and start working on holding things in his hands - -"
there he is.
"my legs don't get a bit tired, but your hands get tired carrying these tools, particularly the handtool carrier."
"roger, al. sure will."
yes. you wouldn't - -
i'm sure he's listening.
"yes, i think that's - that's funny; it - you wouldn't think it that way."
tell jim lovell to practice digging (laughter).
"boy, look at - look at all the texturing - look here, pete; now, we are crossing across something that's got a completely different texture than what we have been on."
you're right.
look at all - looky here. we got all sorts of - -
"this is halo - let's take son_ pictures here. 05 13 _6 57 lmp this - we've run across a sort of a textural contact. we're suddenly on a - on an area that's quite - not so smooth; it's got dimples and wrinkles in it. you want me to take some pictures or what, pete?"
yes. why don't you come up here - -
okay.
- - and we'll take a couple of good dirt bag samples of this stuff. 05 13 17 14 i24p okay.
i'll get the - - age
"it's interesting. you know, i think this looks like that material that we talked about the first day in front of the lm. maybe it runs past the lm down into this area. but it's sure different than where we've been. it - like it's more - the material is more cohesive and forms clumps, in- stead of being so nice and smooth .... around behind you."
"i was waiting for the gnomon to damp out, but - -"
"okay. right here. good shot here, pete."
"i wanted to get n_ foot - footprints in it too, so they could see that."
okay.
uh-oh.
"you know, i think i'll take some a little further away. back up a little, and shoot a 15-foot one, if it's okay."
yes. i'm going to dig.
ail right. i'll be back to collect in just a second; let me get this 15 footer.
it's halo crater. it has slightly big - yes.
"hey, i'm shooting about four here. okay. quite interesting that this - -"
just get some sample bags and we'll - -
"okay, pete."
- - scoop this stuff.
okay.
"let me - boy, it sure is fine; it's kind of like over at the other - at sharp crater."
"yes. looks the same, except on the surface it just seems - -"
except it looks almost finer.
yes.
wait a minute and i'll get you another bag - -
"it's funny though. if you saw this on earth, you'd think it was a - a real soft dirt that had just been rained on recently."
...
"not hard rain, but just a sprinkle, so that the droplets - -"
there you go.
"now, that's a good sample bag full."
"that's 12-d, houston, the sample bag number - -"
"is halo crater a shallow crater, houston?"
copy. 12-d.
with a couple or three dimple craters in the south side of it?
"stand by, pete."
"we can collect a rock while we wait, pete."
"well, i - well, look; i think this is halo crater right here - -"
all right. let's ease over there.
- - and let's go get some rocks from it and everything; we're seeing it right; we - we - we're - we've actually got the soil sample from part of it.
okay.
"but this isn't 20 feet in diameter. is it right on the rim of the surveyor crater, houston? pag3e3o jon tde )ay6"
"that's affirmative; and, from your comments on the three dimples, we show that you're there."
okay. 'w_natdo you want in it?
it's a 20-foot-diameter crater?
about 20.
we'd like to get the pan and a double core tube.
i can't believe we're at the right place.
"i - i'm not sure that we're at the right place, either. let me look at the top of this hill, here. this is surveyor crater. let me look at the chart."
there's a nice rock right there.
here's surveyor.
"let me look at the map, not even hardly a crater worth looking at where we are."
okay .... crater.
"okay, pete. it's your call there; you're the local experts. if you see a better location for that double core tube, go ahead."
"yes. we're just trying to find the right - right crater, houston."
"hey, pete. i think it's that area right over there -"
where?
"that's the - halo is this first one right here, the little one, and then all those others are next over, according to the chart."
okay.
so we can just go over there and - -
which one's halo? this one right here?
"this - no, it's right - see where i'm pointing? 05 !3 21 29 cdr no."
"as i see it, it's that one right over there."
okay. let's go.
okay.
and i have the double core tube?
all right.
"and you want what, houston, a partial pan?"
that's affirmative.
i guess we're trying to get these - -
"we'd like a full pan at that point, pete."
"and also, al, if you could give us some sort of an estimate of how hard it is to get the core tube in. that is, what's the force you have to use; how many pounds and how much force."
sure will.
"hey, look at this little neat-o crater right here. it's a good place to sample."
"oh, look at all the glass in the bottom of that baby. got a lot of that, though."
huh?
got a lot of glass.
out there?
yes.
i think that's halo right there. p g3e32 aconfide da6y
which one?
the one you're looking at. right over - it's that one - that one right there.
too big.
"too big, huh?"
let's take this one right here.
"ail right. that's good .... glass out of the bottom of this baby, don't we?"
okay.
"pete and al, could we have a readout on the cameras at this point?"
"sure could. just a second. yes. see mine probably, pete."
you'd better take all these pictures; i'm running out.
"well, i'd better change cameras because - -"
sixty - 60 for al.
you've got - 110. you still got plenty to go.
"hey, i - you know what's happened?"
no.
this thing hasn't been taking every picture.
take a picture and let's see.
"i - i just caught it. i - i mean, it's been doing it - intermittently."
"okay. now, get out and make the double core tube here."
"pete, we copy 60 and 110 on the film."
that's affirm.
"here, look at the chart a minute, pete, while - -"
yes. okay. be careful. stay over here.
"pete and al, we'd like you to go ahead and get the pan's taken on the lmp's camera. you can either have al do the pan's or switch cameras. your choice."
okay. roger-roger. _
"okay, pete. you'll have to unscrew - pull the pin and unscrew that if you can."
okay.
"good luck on unscrewing it. hey, wait. hold it just a second."
i'll get it. 334 nfideij j'iilqiiw da6y
"okay. hey, good show."
okay.
double core tube. drive it. give it a go.
i'm going to hand you the h_mer. i'm not sure that double core tube screws on as far as it should. try it again.
"pete and _l, houston. be sure you give us the number of the lower core t_oe, please."
"okay. the lower core tube is number 3, i think. yes."
three?
"three, and the upper one's 1. okay."
ready to pound it. 05 13 25 12 _ where are you going to drive it?
"where would you recommend? 05 13 25 15 it_p well, let's go over to this crater, right here."
okay.
where it's soft around those little - craters. 05 13 25 27 _ about right here.
yes.
want to take a picture?
yes.
"i can shove it in a little - i hope this is a good soft place. it seems to be. oh, i hit something solid there. well, i shoved it in - i used all my weight, houston, and shoved it in about 11 inches. now, i'll just pound on it awhile and see what we can do. it's going in okay. yes. it's going on down."
keep augering.
no. we've got a good spot. i don't th_k - really think this is the right place. some of those things aren't so obvious.
"got awful solid, didn't it?"
"oh, it's going. let me wiggle it a bit. it's got one core tube completely in, now. have to hit it harder."
"hey, houston. this h_mmer - when you hit on the side of it, like you have to do to ... it within this suit, it knocks little chips of metal off the side of the hammer. i don't think that's too good. 05 1326 48 cc roger, al. is it damaging the hammer or the core tube?"
"i'm afraid some of the fragments will damage the suit. it's not damaging itself. you know, it's - it's just breaking the - hey, i'm better left- handed than right. there goes another fragment. do you see it, pete?"
"yes, i'm watching."
you even hit it with the front end and some of them pop off. they're flying all over the place.
okay. he's up to the bottom of the handgrip por- tion of the upper tube. he's really driving that baby.
"look at that ham- look at that - look at that (laughter). looks like it's got a coating over the h_mmer, pete, and i'm knocking the coating. instead of being a steel or aluminum h_mmer, it's - -"
yes.
"- - some sort of coated arrangement. beating the heck out of it, isn't it?"
"that's affirmative, al. there is a coating on that hammer and that's probably what you're pa e336 tcon'fidetnt' 6 knocking off. and also, we want to be sure to get the site there documented."
we'll document it for you.
coming up.
we almost got it.
0oh! almost.
"hit something solid there, didn't you?"
"no. it's just getting down there, pete."
"hey, that baby is in the ground."
"we've got a double; now, the question is, can we pull it out?"
(laughter)
... solid ...
let me take - let me get the down-sun shot. i hope that's a good spot.
"i do, too."
ought to get some of these rocks nearby here.
"come on. let's see - 250, 11. ail right."
"you give them that low pan or something, so they can see where this came from. so they - -"
you - you do it; i don't have that much film.
okay. why don't i just trade you cameras? that's probably the smart way.
"ail right. 05 13 28 h6 lmp hey, would you lift mine off, when you're through?"
sure will.
"i can't pull those things right. they tend to vacuum weld a little bit or something, i think."
"now, you hold that one - 05 13 28 59 i24p hey, that's about to come apart."
"be darned if it isn't; i'll fix it, hold the handle there. back - ... come apart."
whoa!
it did come apart. it did come apart.
son of a gun.
"well, that kind of bombed out. i tell you what, the only thing we can - did it - -"
it broke!
sure did break.
"well - the nut that holds the handle of the camera on broke off; and so, the handle's free, but that's okay; we'll just carry it around."
let me ask you a question. is mine tight?
"roger, al. we got you. we - we understand that the nut broke, but you - the camera is still usable, right? 05 13 29 44 i24p yes. and your nut's loose too, pete. stay - stay there. let me tighten it up for you. they work loose in one-sixth g; yet, we - we knew that; we should have - watched it more carefully."
finished?
can you help do that yourself?
yes.
because it's hard for me to do.
yes. t con .. 6
"let me go put the hammer up and this camera some- where and - there goes the bracket, but that's okay. still got the camera."
but you're going to have to help me get this camera off; i can't get it off.
okay. there's no need to get it off now.
"okay. i'll leave it on. no, i want to give it to you."
and you're going to use this one?
"al, you got to take the surveyor pictures, so why don't i give you the camera?"
okay. that's good enough.
"but it's still got 50 pictures or so. now, watch it; make sure it takes a picture each time it turns."
okay.
"and just - why don't you - the camera - i'll tell you what - well, here, i'll hold it and you take this one off."
"okay. you got that camera. take this one off. help me take it off; now, i'll tighten the nut. and i'm going to tip it down a little bit."
wait a minute; i'll hold that down. 05 13 31 11 lm_ there you go. tip it - push - push your rcu down a little bit more.
i'm trying to.
"a bit more, it's almost off, pete. push down some more."
i can't.
"there you go. okay, now. i can tighten this thing. yes, i'm tightening so it'll get tight. okay. i got enough, there; that'll be enough. drop it right there. .onfide. tt,/m"
"ail right. i'll drop that one in here. 05 13 31 _5 lmp well, why don't you - ... - -"
... carry it.
that's what i'd do; carry it or something.
but - but i got too much other stuff.
i - let me carry part of it or something. okay. let me go pull out the core tube.
"no, i tell you what. we can always take the magazine off this and put it on the other one."
"that's what we can do, i guess."
yes. we just drop it in here.
okay.
ail right. let's go get your core tube. i'll go get it.
okay. you go get it. here i'll - -
get the cap off.
"take the cap, right here."
"okay. hey, you sure beat on it. 05 13 32 21 i34p that's what it took to get it in the ground."
it's coming up real easy.
what?
i say it's coming up real easy.
"looked for a minute like you were going down real easy (laughter). the core tube hangs in and your feet just sink down. okay, hold."
"hey, we made a tactical error here. 05 13 32 49 i24p in what fashion?"
i think we dropped an end of the tube we shouldn't have dropped.
no.
yes. we got to take them apart. remember?
"okay. well, what we'll have to do is pick it up, right over there."
where is it?
it's right over here.
okay.
hold - hold on. we'll find it.
"it's right back there; it's someplace buried in the dirt. i see it. ha, ha. right here. wait a minute. i'll get it with the - here, you hold the core tube."
okay. just a second. just a second. okay. i've got the core tube. i'll start unscrewing it.
where's my sample stir?
"right there. you got it, pete. all right. you got you_ hose, too. pull - there you go. good show."
uh-oh.
what?
"hey, this ain't going to work, gang."
why?
"well, see the - here, wait a minute. reach inside the core tube. wait. which goes which way - there you go. beautiful. put that in there. you got it? you got that one? okay?"
yes.
"boy, i drove a nice core tube in there."
"well, it doesn't look any different, though, to the eye - halfway down."
loan me the tweezers a moment. see that cap right there? the cap right there. okay.
ooh. can you haul the camera now?
sure. i can just lift - why don't i just lift this up?
"well, there goes the shovel, but we can get that in a minute. 05 13 34 56 imp okay. that's good."
wait.
just a little closer?
"now, wait a - wait. hold it right there."
okay.
that a boy. that's the way to go.
"good show there, commander."
let me hold on to that thing.
right.
"just lift it, okay? you got her?"
is this on there tight enough?
yes.
"okay. put the shovel back on here? i'll get it. okay. looks good, pete."
"pete, we copy that you finished the core tube. is that affirm?"
"yes, sir. we got a double core tube and all put together correctly."
very good. well done. have you gotten the panorama?
"no, i'm going to get a1 to do that right now. he's using my camera. his camera's had it. with the handle off it and everything; by the time we got done handling it, we got dirt all over the lens. we run out of film; we happen to have another magazine with us, or we could change that one - - 05 13 36 32 i_mp - - don't change that; just take that one off."
or we could do that or - -
"of course, we don't want to, but if we have to, i guess we can. okay. let me start this pan."
"seventy-four. 05 13 36 42 _ seventy-four it is, f:ll, 250. okay?"
"okay, houston. what else would you like here?"
"okay, pete. you're 2 hours and 7 minutes into the eva. and we show you leaving halo at around 2:15. and now, that's for a 4-hour eva. we've extended you 30 minutes for a total eva of 4 hours. we'd like, before you go on, to have a good emu check and sit down and regroup and figure out a plan of attack on the surveyor. one thing we would like to make sure is that you remain away from directly below the surveyor as you move up to it; that is, move up to it on one side or the other, either north or south."
okay. we concurred with that. we were talking about it last night. we're going to approach it from the side.
roger.
"that's it, pete; pan's complete. probably ought to get rocks - one of these rocks here; just throw it in the bag - -"
yes. i think we ought to. clionfl
how about - you want to get this one?
... for a sample bag.
let's - let's sample a couple of these laying right over here.
good idea. that a boy.
"oh, wow, my ears just came back down."
just a second. i shouldn't have done that.
"okay. here, take one quick picture so we can save some film."
ail right. here it goes. i 05 13 38 34 lmp where it came from.
"okay. just a second. 05 13 38 5! lmp those little holders for this - for these sample bags are ridiculous, you know. in this light gravity up here, if you put anything in the holder and move, it flips it right out of it. come out of there, sample bag. there you go. funny how this one - go in there. go in - that a boy. give me some of that dirt around there, too, pete. drop it right in. this is going in sample bag 13-d, houston. looks pretty good, pete."
"roger, al."
"al, let's move up on the rim of the surveyor crater and start getting some rocks, gnomon, - and we'll figure out - there you go."
"al, could we have some sample bag numbers while you're working along there?"
"sure could. i thought i - didn't i call out 13-d, houston? i guess i didn't call it out loud enough. i think it was 13-d. then, let me - i'll check the next one and if you - the next time we stop i'll tell you the next one for sure and then you'll know what it is. ( onftdenti'a?,"
"roger. thank you, al."
"al, look at these rocks; they look a little bit different. let's grab some."
"yes, sir."
"look at that glass in the bottom of that one. they look like granites, don't they?"
they do; they look just like granite. here's a beauty over - here's a beauty.
where?
right here. that is a nice rock.
huh?
right around here. let's get this one for sure. right there.
okay.
"won't fit in the bag, but it's sure different. it seems to have some - -"
got a big glass splotch on it.
yes. that's a good one. that's a real good rock. get some pictures - -
wait. wait. wait. wait. okay. it's in.
"that's a beauty. that gnomon doesn't really damp as fast as it should, you know, pete? i think it does great in one g, but one-sixth g, it won't - doesn't seem to damp right. let me get the cross- suns too. oops, got to get over where you are."
okay.
we will just put that in; that's a beautiful rock.
"okay. you going to scoop it up? you know, you need some tongs that will get bigger samples than we've got. dnftd=eni't"
watch that.
"you know, seeing that, i just thought -"
"hey, that's beautiful. it's got a lot of - hold it !"
don't drop it.
nearly dropped it. tough to hold it.
"okay. now, i want some of these granites over here - or what looks like granite."
okay. let's try that.
"doesn't that lm look neat, sitting on the other side of that crater?"
(laughter) yes. it does; we ought to get a shot of that.
yes. get a shot of home.
"okay. let me see, how many pictures have i got now, pete?"
"143. 05 13 42 53 i24p 143, okay -"
you're getting close to the end - we ought to - -
"okay. that's 14-d, houston, is the next sample bag, so the last one was 13-d. let me take a picture quick here."
ah-u_h-ow.
"roger, intrepid. we copy that."
"al, why don't you step across over here? 05 13 43 17 _ all right."
step across over there; photograph that rock right there - wait until i drop the gnomon in - - age346 i onfidentit i 6
okay.
- - and do it in such a manner as to get this crater that it came out of.
that's a good idea. let me see if i can; i'll have to back - let me get a 15-foot shot.
yes. that's just.what ! was just thinking.
15-foot.
"pete, could we have your present position?"
"roger. we're - if you were looking at the surveyor crater and west with 12 o'clock, we're at the 9 o'clock position on the surveyor crater."
"okay, pete."
"roger. copy that. copy you're right on the rim, and we'd like to get a good _j check and a rest here before you proceed."
"that's a good idea, houston - -"
"okay, houston. that's a good idea. what - what we're going to do is i'm getting this - -"
"wait - wait 1 - wait, pete; i've got an idea."
what?
this rock - might be good for 13. let me reach back here and grab this strap.
"okay, now?"
go. okay. let me roll a little bit over.
"that a boy. back up. now, if they had a strap like that, they could just hold the other guy while he leaned over and picked up a rock."
"hey, that's a- - teonfident"
"it works pretty good. it sure saves time. look at the sheer face on that rock, something whistled by it or something."
"it's fractured a bit; it's got some - pretty inter- esting fracture marks on it. it also has got some - what looks like abrasion marks on it; maybe that's just hard-packed dirt. boy, there's a lot of flashing crystals in that rock - crystal faces. it's a good rock."
"listen, i'll tell you what i recommend we do while we're taking - -"
okay. let me get a - -
- - an emu break.
okay. let me take the - the picture of that where the rock was. right there.
okay. what i recommend we do is change film packs. 05 13 45 13 _ ail right. that's a good idea. we'll do that next. age onfiden'tl t 6
"okay. why don't i - okay, i'll get this camera out -"
stay right there just a second.
shoot a - shoot a good - shoot a pan and get the surveyor - use up that film.
"hey, that's good. i didn't - that ought to be good. ah, it's a bad place to shoot, but i'll try it, though."
"al, what i think we can do is walk down here about 300 feet and walk straight down that slope to it."
"i do, too. it doesn't look so bad from here, does it, pete?"
no.
"okay. want to change the cameras, now?"
"pete, will that direction of your travel be to the northeast direction?"
"no, what we do is go directly east and then walk directly short of north, you know, curving right around and down to it. it doesn't look bad - it's - i'll tell you, getting - -"
roger. copy. you're going directly east and then you'll be curving around going up north towards the surveyor.
"yes. you get a - kind of an optical illusion, depending on where you're standing."
trade me one. trade me magazines.
okay. wait a minute.
careful when you undo it.
"i'll tell you what. you'd better put that one in. 05 13 46 52 imp no, we want the dark. nft, denti"
okay.
"i wanted to put it back on here, pete."
ail right. i'll try.
i don't think it makes any difference. we just put it in here. you're right.
ail right.
just put it right in there with the rocks.
"yes. yes. thank you. 05 13 47 10 _ let me - let me hold the camera, see - wait a minute. okay. go. boy, these cameras got dirty, didn't they? that won't be any trouble."
"pete, a reminder on that film pack, cycle one frame before you start."
"roger. we cycled one before we took it off, too. i think we're in good shape, houston."
good thing we've practiced this a few times. i tell you what. why don't you let me hold it for you? okay?
"just a second. here, i'll show you what you need to do. pull this out of the way. the rock is what's driving me buggy. wait, wait. hold the camera. hold it there."
okay.
that's - that's it.
hold the camera.
okay. got it?
...
that's it. you got it.
we got it. _n fident j_ day 6
good show. hot dog.
"wait a minute; wait a minute. okay, keep the trigger pulled. trigger pulled. let her go. now try it again. try it again. that's it, babe. no strain. okay, let me put it on."
"that lens is good and clean, too."
okay. hope we didn't get anything on the reseau lens inside. i bet we got some dust on it. where am i? okay.
huh?
"great. got her on there, pete."
there you go. okay. let's wander over here.
"yes. i think a strap on you or something like that so - each of you, so if you want to lean over and pick up a rock, the other guy just holds the strap; you lean over and pick up the rock and go. some bigger sample bags. hey, pete, why don't i - i'll bring it back."
what do you want?
i was going to say as long as you're - -
"good thought, al."
"we're moving on, houston."
"a few minutes ago, pete wanted to pick up a rock, so i held onto a - that strap of the surveyor bag and he leaned right over and picked it up and i helped him get back up. it's not that you're heavy or anything, it's the fact that you don't - you have such poor balance."
look at that glass - ...
"pete and al, houston. before you go much further, could you stop and have a little break there before you proceed on down the slope? c )n.fidentt"
sure can.
"yes. we're just going to move to the area, where we could stop and case the joint. al, grab a shot of that headed glass there and we'll hag it."
okay.
that's better than the hope diamond.
set her up.
better take that.
there you are in here.
okay.
"okay. i got it, pete."
got her?
yes. got a lot of those; we've - got too many of them.
"oh, you did get a lot of these?"
yes. why don't you get that? pick it up - -
get the rock with it. look.
"okay. get some rocks with it. that's a good id - hey, here's some rocks right here. there's good rocks. you know, we keep collecting a lot of the same type of rocks, because there just doesn't seem to be any other kinds around. i haven't seen any microbreccia the whole day; i've looked around for it. ail i have seen is some basalt; i've seen nothing that looked vesicular at all, except on the surface."
i haven't either.
"you know, that's real strange; it's - it's not at all like nell's rocks. close as it comes is that gabbro - - (ionfid-ent 6"
"roger. we copy those comments. pete and al, we show you're 2 plus 23 into the eva; and, based on a 4-hour eva, you'd be leaving the surveyor at 2 plus 50. but don't rush; we'd like to make sure you get a good rest before you go into it."
okay.
"why don't you give me a rock or two, pete, and i'll stick in there. got any spares? there you go. good rock. good rock."
get a load of this crazy juggling act.
"treasure. okay. that will hit. we just made a sample of - glass bead and some local rock on the south edge of the surveyor crater, houston. and they're going into bag 14-d."
i'm remembering back to all of our training.
14-d.
"i'm trying to remember who the guy was that kept saying, ""whatever you do, don't get dust on the gnomon. it 05 13 52 33 cdr/imp (laughter)"
"okay. we're going to jog on here for a little bit, houston, and get a little bit closer to the surveyor and look her over. 05 13 52 53 imp yes. hey, that's coming in from the south; looks like a good way, pete."
"i'll tell you what i'm going to do, al. i'm just going to lope right around here."
"that's what i mean. if you stay at this level, you'll end up at surveyor."
you're right.
follow the contour lines.
"no problem at all, houston .... the scoop and you couldn't see that before. it's kind of - - cii ,i tt,ji ,"
"pete and al, could you give us a comment on how far you're sinking in?"
"not sinking in very far at all; this is fairly firm stuff. and i'm down in the crater about the same distance down that surveyor is. i'm just going around it radially. wouldn't you say so, al?"
"yes, i would say that - i think houston is just concerned about us getting down in this crater. we been thinking about it, too, houston."
"okay. don't worry about it, houston, because it's - really, it's no strain; i'm 200 feet away from it - -"
that's right.
"- - it isn't exactly like we thought it was going to be last night, when we were talking about it."
roger. sounds good.
"yes, it is. i don't think there'll be any sweat about it."
"al, i'll tell you what let's do. let's go right over here, and we'll park all our gear, take our- selves a little rest, go over your photo plan, and then we'll have at it. 05 13 54 18 _ okay. let's go right over here."
"i'll tell you what, why don't you get a photograph of it right now?"
that's a good place. okay. will do. i can do it right here.
i'm trying to see which way it landed.
"okay, pete and al, when you are looking at it there, would you also try to determine whether there is any effect from the dust during the descent? that is, could you determine whether pa e 6 there is more dust on either the west or the east side of any of the bays, and the north or the south side of the camera?"
"okay. we sure will. i actually flew around it; however, i probably passed closer to it than i am parked to it right now. no, that's not really true. i'll tell you, the way that dust was going, it probably went right over top of it."
yes. that's right. any dust you hit on the edge would never go down in this crater.
"yes. what happened to your volume, al?"
i don't know. how does - sounds good to me.
you're just a little bit down in the mud.
okay. i'm not talking loud enough.
we read you both loud and clear.
okay. no problem.
"i'm going to mosey up here just a little, pete, without any tools, which makes it pretty easy."
"look, i'll tell you what. let's leave the whole - tell you what, let's take the tool carrier with us -- --"

"you know, i could have landed the lm in the bottom of that crater. it would have scared me to death, but -"
"okay. okay, pete. why don't - would you carry the handtool carrier down there?"
whoop.
and let me take some pictures up here around it?
okay.
"now, look. you can see which way it came in. see the way these gearpads dug in over there - -"
yes.
- - dug up dirt? they're still setting there.
yes.
"this is going to make a good shot. we're not supposed to take pictures with that mag; we'll have to do it, though. 05 13 56 43 i24p beautiful. beautiful sight. you know, this one's brown and i don't remember ours being brown there at the cape. kind of a light tan or maybe that - maybe that's the way it's changed color. what color was this one, houston, white? when - when it started out?"
stand by on that. _- 05 13 57 03 cdr yes. it looks a light tan now. t onf'tdent/i 6
"hey, this crater isn't as steep as we thought, pete."
"no. i'd better be careful; i'm going to get dust on her. yes. 05 13 57 19 _p i'll stop here, and this'll be my last picture."
"al, the equipment bays were white on the side, and the scoop itself was a light blue."
"well_ it's kind of a - wells we'll get down there and get closer inspection. what was the general color of all the structure? for example, all the struts and the like? tell you what, it looks like - -"
that's all white. the equipment bays and the pri- mary structure was all painted with a white paint.
really turned tan or something; we'll have to look at it more closely.
"yes. that's what happened. it just changed color, huh?"
"it sure has. something has cooked that paint brown. can't imagine what. you know, it's funny; on the slopes here, it's just a little bit softer. but there's no tendency to slip down or anything like that."
i kno_.
"i don't think it's any deeper. a little softer maybe, maybe a little deeper. why don't i move this down here just a little bit closer, pete?"
okay. 05 13 58 26 _ then we'll take the rest down here where we can see it better.
okay. let's just make sume we don't get any dirt down there on it. 05 13 58 30 _p okay. we'll walk real slow. -ftdent

"wonder if that was from us? 05 13 58 58 imp oh, no. i don't think so. as you notice, there's a general trend of lines along here from the north - that would be the northeast or the southwest - see those little lines running along through the crater here?"
yes.
"i'll take a picture of that. boy, this thing is dusty .... 8, just do this."
"yes, this has those lineal patterns here, houston. right down inside the crater; and they're not - they're not laying at all in the same direction - i mean, it's not from us - not from the lm."
no.

"hey, al, did you get a picture right across there?"

i'll tell you what. you're just going to have to get that - reach in under enough to cut it on the other side.
just wait a second. let me get in there.
okay.
drop that in the can. that's the only piece they're going to get that way. okay .... watch it.
"yes. i've got to cut the cable back here, though. okay."
"why don't you - why don't you give that a cut right there, pete? give them a couple of pieces. there you go."

"okay, one shiny tube coming up. okay, wait a minute. be around there in a minute. look at how all that stuff fractured and fell on the ground."
yes.
the paint's flaked off.
"yes. that looks like a shiny mirror, some kind of thermal coating."
"i hate to tell you this, but the surveyor tool is giving me - -"

"yes, or i'm going to break the tool."
i know it. that's - -
"that tube on the back we are supposed to collect, houston, is just a little bit stronger than it's supposed to be, for a glass mirror."

roger. we copy.
that's a shiny tube; that would be a good one if we could cut it.
where?
right there.

"yes, i guess it looks it, doesn't it?"
get the camera. forget the tube.
why don't you bang your way out of that glass?
"... or break the tool, no kidding."

why don't you bang that glass one?
"won't even break (laughter). that's pretty good glass, houston. can't even break it with our - -"

"kind of crunches, doesn't it? man, that's not glass. terrible! man, forget it."
i don't know what it is.
that's sure not what we tried out in houston - i mean at the cape. that's metal with glass on top of it.
you'd better take a picture of it.
"amazing. that's a tough shot, too. let's get over on this side of it."

one scoop.
"that's dandy! it's even got dirt in it. bring back some of the original dirt. okay. got an extra sample for you, houston. the scoop's got dirt in it. okay."
"well done, troops. says when you move out from here, right? - well, first of all, we show you're 3 hours into the eva; and you're about 10 minutes behind nominal traverse we had figured out for a 4-hour eva. however, your plss consumables are holding out real well, so we suggest you go on with the nominal traverse. we may want you to cut down to perhaps just one sample at blocky crater."

"well, they'll know when they get that tv camera back ..."
"okay, pete and al, before you leave there, also, would you get some of those geosamples which we've discussed, as well as some of the loose soil from that area?"
will do. we'll do it right now.
okay.
let's do it.
here's this rock right here. let me give the surveyor tool a heave.
okay.

right on the other side of the - about 200 yards that way. see that big boulder sitting up there; the biggest one we've seen since we've been here.

this - there it was kind of hung up on the gnomon. let me get the gnomon and pick it up. it's not usually on there - no gnomon.

"i can't - forget it. i thought i saw something. 05 1_ 39 08 cdr i'm beginning to think that these rocks that look red to us, if we'd just crack them open, we'd find they're plain old basalt rock on the inside. we just don't ever have any cracked. we ought to pound one of those things with a hammer in a minute."
"okay, you want me to do a pan of this little part or the whole crater, pete?"
"no, get the whole crater. get about four shots across it and then move over and get another four."

does it feel okay back there?
"oh, it feels okay; sure the way to carry gear; it sure beats that thing. that's a pain. now, wait a minute; where are you shooting, al? i want you to shoot down in that crater right there."

shoot way down into it; get a stereo of that thing with those big blocks down there.

okay. we'd like to give you a little weight summary for the rock boxes. if - we estimate you probably got about the same in rock box 2 as you did in rock box 1. no problem there. the surveyor parts and tv camera will show a nominal 25 pounds in 15. what you could put in your bag that goes on the floor is about 15 pounds worth of rocks.
"that's it, houston."
"and in the left-hand side stowage bag, you can put about 25 pounds of rock. so i guess those are the two you are working for now. fifteen pounds' worth of rocks in the bag on the floor, and 25 pounds on the left-hand side stowage bag."
"we - we don't have that many rocks, houston. i'll tell you what we've got. we've got - src 2 is full and closed. it's - gosh, i hope i got it all in there, let me see: solar wind, core tubes, environ- mental gas sample, documented samples all made it in. and the box is full, and i closed it, and i've got about - what's 1 inch on my scale? - i've got about 1 inch worth of rocks in another hag. and that's it; that's all the rocks we've got. a bunch."

"for - for your information, i crossfed on the csi burn and that sort of evened me up, and i also switched my dap load to system a."
roger. copy. 05 23 22 22 _ let's - no.
"and my out-of-plane shows 0.31 miles at 0.3 foot per second, so i think we'll forget her."
"okay, pete. that sounds good. while you got a minute, we've got a question about the sequence l- camera. did that camera stop right after lift-off?"
"apparently it did, and then it stopped again, several times."
"that's affirmative. it stopped, and i started it, and it stopped two or three times."
roger.
that's the way it goes.
clock should be happy.
huh?
let me write this r-dot down.
"say, i guess nobody else has - anybody else had to use these window heaters before? our windows keep fogging over, and i have to run the window heaters all the time."
"intrepid, houston. the folks down here say that was pretty nominal for apollo 11."
"oh, i didn't remember that. okay. very good."
here we go.
"hey, pete."
"go ahead, dick."
my cdh time on my computer is 143:59:46.70 - 47.
okay. we're within a couple - about 15 seconds of one another.
okay. we're going to use yours.
okay. 124:00:01.53.
i got it. thank you.
"intrepid, houston."
go.
"roger, pete. i sent you bum dope. !1 did not use their heaters."
"yes. i don't remember anybody having to use them, and both my docking window and - and both al's window and my window - we've collected moisture on the lunar surface, and we've started collecting it, here, in flight; so, i put the window heater back on."
roger.
"you in po - are you in verb 76, pete?"
what do you want?
"yes, i want to do it - just - -"
okay.

"enter, 127. clear, 316, plus 01270, and seven 9's."
"sure do apologize, houston, for the overburn. i got my head looking at a1 there, and i just shut her off late."
"roger. no sweat, pete."
"what did he do this time, pete?"
say again?
"what the devil did he do this time, pete?"
"he didn't do anything. we had one main shutoff valve stay barber poled over here, and it turned out to be an indicator, but i got interested in that, and i didn't dearm the engine soon enough, and we shut down about 30 feet per second over. that's the reason i had to back her out. no big _- deal."
you on hot mike? ... okay.
"okay, pete. my first try at it is 18 miles ..."
s-band what?
...
"okay, dick. you're __ost unreadable."
"clipper, houston. your s-band is getting pretty ratty."
"you got a big clip? give me a big clip. 05 23 28 47 _ okay, just - take that clip?"
i'm going to hold that stupid shade from unrolling every time i turn around. okay.

"negative. we don't believe so, apollo 11. we think that this is possibly due to some tli dispersions, and it's probably satisfactory. so go ahead and accept this. it fits our criteria anyway that if you repeat the mark and you get an equivalent size to go ahead and accept it. and this is an equivalent size error. over."

okay. i'm going to trim up the attitude here and give it another try.
"okay. i have this star loud and clear now, charlie, so i might as well do a bunch of marks on this one to get a good horizon count."
roger. stand by.
"it still looks like i'm far from the substellar point. however, i'm off quite a hit in roll."
"roger. we'd like you to mark right where it is now, mike, and we'd like two sets of marks on this. over."
okay. fine. but the reticle is not parallel to the horizon. i'd have to move off quite a hit in order to get it parallel to that.
"apollo 11, houston. our procedures guys are saying that the reticle does not have to he parallel. over."

"apollo 11, houston. the ground-computed values for your shaft and trunnion are just what you're getting on the dsky there, mike. the horizon looks cocked off to you - you look like you're off in roll because the angles that we gave you to maneuver to, to prevent lm reflection from fouling up your optics, we feel like a- you should go ahead and mark on the stars just as is. over."

"okay, charlie. it just appears to me that you have to have a reticle tangent to the horizon at the point at which you mark or else you're not at the substellar point; you're off laterally, and therefore you're measuring a larger trunnion angle than you should."

yes. go ahead.
"okay. for today, we'd like you on p23 to make a trunnion bias determination, prior to p23 sightings as called out in procedures, and also one afterwards. our intent here is to check out the possibility that some sort of thermal effect may be giving you errors in the angular read-out in the sextant. the bias that you get beforehand should be incorporated, that is a proceed on noun 87 after you get two consecutive measure- ments equal to within 0.003 degrees. and, of course, move the trunnion off a couple of degrees between the measurements. the earth should be a lot smaller in your field of view today. i'm , sure you're a lot more qualified to tell us about that than we are, but to ensure that you're getting a good angle measurement between the star and the earth horizon, the sextant m-line, which is the line that runs through the two hash marks and is perpendicular to the r-line, should be parallel to the earth horizon at the substellar point. and then the actual super- imposition of the star upon the horizon can be made at any point in the field of view of the sextant: above, below, or on the m-line. we recommend the marks be made as rapidly as possible after auto maneuver. if you feel that the amount of time between the auto maneuver and the time you get ready to mark is excessive, or that you don't like that auto maneuver attitude when you get ready to mark, of course, you can use a verb 94 - verb 94 to get you back to the flashing 51 position to redo the auto maneuvers. over."

"roger, ll. i guess in keeping the cups of coffee score, why you get that one."
"well - okay - well, this morning, let's just see how close it comes to being parallel to the m-line. before we started marking for the first time, it appeared that the computation of - of those three angles was somewhat off, and that _ was wasting a lot of gas by going to those three angles and then having to make large attitude changes after that to get the m-line parallel. in some cases it appeared to be just an accepted attitude required, and you all said that it wasn't needed. so i was marking in some cases with the m-line not parallel. i thought perhaps you had some processor for computing that offset and making sense out of that data, but as far as i know, we've got to have the m-line parallel to the horizon."
"roger, 11. we don't have that capability. we do require that the m-line be parallel to the horizon in order to get a good mark. we feel that possibly the - the state vector information that you were using for your maneuver basis yes- terday may have needed to be updated a little. and if you'll standby a second, we'll give you an evaluation of what we feel you'll get today by the auto maneuver."

"roger, buzz. we noticed the same thing. it's very similar to looking at a light shining on something like a billiard ball or a bowling ball. you get this bright spot in the blue of the water, and that turns it to sort of a grayish color."

"no, we haven't been able to detect any moisture anyplace in the spacecraft. it seems to be fine. 01 03 29 .=0 lmp one of the hydrogen filters - the one that we've got on the hot water - seems to keep flowing when you remove one of the food bags from it. its flow rate is quite small, right near the end of one out, and that contributes a little bit of moisture to the atmosphere."
"yes, that hydrogen thing, it's - i'm not sure, but i think it's a backpressure problem. if the thing sees any baekpressure at all, like when the bag is attached, well the flow rate will slowly de- crease to where it's almost zero, and you wait, and you wait, and you wait for that last o,_uce. you think you have its and you remove the bag, and then you very rapidly thereafter see maybe a glob the size of a dime or a quarter come out and just hang there. that appears to be true even though the opening into the bag is not restricted."

"well, that's intermittently affirmative, bruce. we have these two hydrogen filters, which work fine as long as you don't hook them up to a food bag. but the entry way into the food bag has enough back pressure to cause the - the filters to start losing their efficiency. a couple of times, i've been tempted to go through that dry- out procedure, but we found that simply by leav- ing the filters alone for a couple of hours, their efficiency seems to be restored."
roger. we copy.
their efficiency ranges anywhere from darn near perfect to terrible just depending on the in- dividual characteristics of the food bags we're putting through them. some of the food bags are so crimped near the entry-way that there's no way we can work them loose to prevent back pres- sure.

"roger. i guess part of the camera's been burnt out down there. these are really beautiful pic- tures now, buzz. over. real clear."
okay. we might have got just a little bit of sun in there. is it just one small white dot?
that's affirmative.
"we went up in the tunnel checking the roll angle, charlie, and it's 2.05 degrees."
roger. copy. 2.05 on the roll cal.
and that's a plus.
roger. plus.
"11, houston. the tunnel looks pretty clear to us. somebody going up there now. over."
it's mike checking his connectors up there now.
roger.
"11, houston. the lighting up in there looks very good to us at this time. over."
i think that's mostly the camera. it - it's subdued to say the least.
roger. it's pretty - it's gathering pretty well to us. we see everything quite clearly up in there.
"well, the docking latches look good today just like they did yesterday. everything up in there looks just fine. (goss ne5 1) tape 36/4"
that sounds fine to us. over.
"11, houston. we can even read the decals up there on the lm hatch."
"well, let me zoom it up and see how much you can read."
okay.
"we can see the lm umbilical connection quite well there, buzz. we see you zooming in on one of the decals now. it's, ""to reset, unlatch handle; latch behind grip and pull back two full strokes."" that's about all we can make out."
"hey, you get an a-plus."
"thank you very much, sir. at least i passed my eye test."
"i'm standing 6 feet from it, charlie, and you can read it better than i can. there's some- thing wrong with the system."
roger.
"that's a real good view of the lm hatch handle there, 11. 0ver."
roger.
looks like we'll be ready to go into the lm early if that's okay with you all down there.
"roger. it's fine with us, nell. go ahead any- time you wish. over."
"11, houston. the white spot you see on your monitor, our tv people say it is a burn spot; but they expect it to dissipate after a couple of hours. over."
roger. thank you.
"okay, the dump valve is actuated."
"roger. copy, 11. we see that very clearly. is that you, buzz, with your hand on it?"
yes.
roger. (goss net 1) tape 36/5
"11, houston. we're really amazed at the quality of the picture ,,pin the tunnel. it's really superb. over. 02 07 36 18 _ it is, considering the amount of light up in there."
roger. we're about to open our hatch now.
roger.
"roger. there's that same guy that, when you open up the door, why, he's waiting there for you, and he turns the lights on."
how about that. just like the refrigerator.
"buzz, the view in through your - by your right - left shoulder there is so good we can see the ascent engine cover, the velcro on it, and that's about all we can make out right now."
now we can see the helmet stowage bag - -
we don't see anything loose up there.
"well, great. looks good to us. we see the helmet storage bag."
"hello, 11. houston. we got a view of the plss there, off the right of our screen."

"i think now i see the utility light still in the stowage bag. hey, that's a great shot right there. we see you in there. guess that's nell and mike. better be, anyway."
we see you waving.
"ll, houston. that's really a beautiful shot. i 02 07 41 46 cc 11, houston. we didn't quite decipher that signal that just came from the cmp."
"just saying hello. on the lcg sight ga_e, you got about - oh, it looks like the white mark that's in the plum_er is about a quarter to three-eighths inch out into the _reen away from the red. is that what yom'd i_ike to see? over."
"stand by. roger, buzz. that looks _ood to um. thank you much."

"stand by. that's affirmative, buzz. it looks good. that's a good reading for us. over."
okay.
we had a shot moment - a moment ago oc the su_t disconnect valve. 02 07 42 58 _ i'll open up the windows and see what the light- ing condition's going to be like.

how's the sun coming in? how's the sun coming in from this direction going to affect what you can see?
"it made it really super. the 15_hting is excellent in the - in the lm ri_ht now. we can make out the aot, the isa, and _he left-hand window - there's a little glare off of that, but the lmp side the - with the shade down it's really excellent. over."

roger. we copy. the light level for the tv is really excellent. over.
"yes, the lighting in the 124is very nice now, just like completely daylight; and everything is visible. a good bit lighter than the tunnel was earlier."
"roger. we got a good view now, neil, of the deda; and also buzz's aca."
"hey, i'm pointing it at the front hatch now. everything seems to be in place down there."
"roger, we got the dump valves in view. over."
roger.
"11, houston. we see you removing the isa now, folding it up, putting it up on the aot. the instrument panels are coming into view behind."
"yes, i think it'd probably be best, since we've done sps burn, to put it back over the instrument panel instead of putting it up over the plss on the recharge station. would you care to comment on that one? we could do either just as easily."
stand by. we'll have an answer for you momentarily.

we'll - we'll put up a couple of hoses in the command module here and get a little circulation going.
sounds like a good idea. over.
"apollo 11, houston. as far as the window shades go in this lm, there's nothing except for crew comfort. i don't think we've got any systems problem. be sure to put them back up when you egress. over."
that we will do.

roger.
there we go. we got it now.
"there wasn't very much debris in the commsnd module or the lm. we found very few loose par- ticles of bolts, nuts, and screws and lint and things. very few in each spacecraft. they were very clean."
roger. sounds good.
"11, houston. we have a good view out off the i rendezvous - correction, the overhead window off i the lm. we don't see anybody starin_ hack at us, though. over."

we can even see the barber pole of the talkbacks.
"we can read the markings on the ir,struments for the glycol pressure, quantity, pcc2. you can even read the scale on the eight ball. over."
"11, houston. we see the cross-feed barber pole, and we have the velcro patches back up to the rcs systems now. we can see the markings on the meters, green and red bands, in limits."

"you can see the signal strength meter for the radar, read the numbers on it."
"houston, did you want us to test the cameras in the lm and - i was wondering about that. i saw it in the flight plan, but i'm just wondering if you want to do that on csm power, or do you want us to take both of the 16mm cameras back in the csm and test them there? over."
"stand by, buzz."
"as an alternative to that, why, we could wait loi day and do it then when we transfer over to lm power. (goss net 1) tape 36/12"

"we understood that, c_arlie."
"okay. on the lm cameras, we'd like you to do it on loi day with the lm power. over."
okay. that's what we'll do.
"houston, we're showing you something that came out of the commander's checklist stowage packet. it's got a 16-millimeter camera in it, and it's got this little cylinder; and i guess - i don't understand what it is. maybe you can tell us."
roger. stand by. we can't figure it out either.
"it's got an arrow on the back, and it says ""turn,"" but i'm afraid to turn it."
"11, your friendly geologist says it's the camera cank- crank, excuse me, for the 16-sequence camera if it jams. over."

"no, what's happening is, we get pretty close to the window now and then, and it drives the automatic light control into the stop, i think."
i think that's right.
"yes, i had the switch on outside while i was going through the overhead window. that may be what's contributing to some of it."
roger.
"11, houston. we seem to be picking up a few more dust particles now. we see them quite clearly in the screen now. over."
"yes, i'm choking on one every so often."
"11, houston. your show is going out to the u.s. now. we're about to get the satellite up. it'll be transmitted to some other countries after that. over."

"11, houston. buzz, how does the alignment look, there?"
"it looks pretty good, as well as i can tell without the gear extended. i can't get a real definitive answer, but you couldn't fix it any place to see much more out of the window without hand-holding it for the whole time."

"that's about the position we'll be putting the camera in after the initial descent on the ladder, and it'll be taken 1 frame a second for most of the eva."
houston copies. out. that's a rea mood view of that camera.
"our monitor is a little bit wavy, so it's hard for us to tell when we're - when we've got a steady picture for you."
"11, we have no complaints at all. we don't see that waviness on our picture. it's just really great. over."
do the edges of the window look like straight lines to you?
that's affirmative.
"okay. they don't in our monitor, and that leads us to make some corrections to the camera, which probably aren't required sometimes. (goss net 1) tape 36/16"
"buzz, we have no complaints at ali. it's a magnificent picture."
"what was that, buzz, you're chasing now?"
"that was - that was me picking up some particles of paint that were floating through the air in front of the camera, there."
"roger, nell. we got it. it appears to us that neil's about to check the velcro mat, there."
"okay, buzz. we see the card up now."
"okay. for those of you that don't know, this is where we log most of our data for each of the lm maneuvers, and we have another card like this that the timeline book that is laid down on the table in front of the data display keyboard; and it's on this timeline that we have all our pro- cedures. but we obviously have to hold these in place in zero g, so we make use of the velcro patches on the back and on the table so we can attach these down here; and then we just turn the pages over when we go to new sequences in our timeline of procedures."

roger. must be some experience. is collins going to go in and look around?
we're willing to let him go but he hasn't come up with the price of the ticket yet.

roger. 03 06 56 t4 cml we can't see any earthshine or any surface features at all in earthshine now due to the fact that the i_mis very bright and is causing our pupils to contract. it's a very fantastic view to see the terminator as you look along the edge of it. i think you'll agree that some of these craters that you're seeing in the picture now are really accentuated by the lengthening of the shadows as they come close to the terminator.
yes. it's a very beautiful and a rugged sight that we've got on the screen now.
"and i think you've got some interesting data on thruster firing versus pitch angle. it looks (goss net 1) tape 51/9 like that lm just wants to head down towards the surface, is all."

"11, houston. roger. your angles are 45 and 255. do i understand that as soon as the car- rier dropped, it went to these angle _; or did it only go to these angles after the uplink carrier was reenabled and the antenna began to reacquire? over."
"no. as soon as the carrier dropped off, why, it drifted over into those angles anti stayed there. then when it came back up again, why, it hunted around for a while, but it didn't get any further off. gradually brought it on in to the angles where it is right now; and then the signal strength would take several jumps as evidently it goes from wide to medium to narrow. over."

"i'm not sure i understand that question, but we (tranq) got a good bit of the ground mass in the bulk sample plus a sizable number of selected rock fragments of different types."
"roger, neil. one of the implications here is the depth from which the b_lk sample was collected. did you manage to get down there several inches or nearer the surface? over."
"we got some down from as much as 3 inches in the (tranq) area where i was looking at variation with depth in the bulk sample. there really wasn't appreci- able difference, and i didn't run into any hard bed. later on, or at some other times aad other areas, why, i'd get down just a short distance, an inch or two, and couldn't go any further."
"roger. be zieve we understand down as deep as 3 inches, did not hit any hard bed, and no significant changes in composition to that depth. next question, the - the second src was packed rather hurriedly due to the time limitation, and wonder if you would be able to provide any more detailed description of the samples which were included in the second src. over."

"the ones that i saw back in the aft end of the (tranq) spacecraft appeared to be a good bit darker; of course, viewed from the aft end, why, they did have the sun shining directly on them. it seemed as though the material had been baked somewhat and also scattered in a radially outward direction, but in that particular area, this feature didn't extend more than about 2, maybe 3 feet, from the skirt of the engine. over."
"roger. understand that near the aft end out to the east that the rays did appear darker. i understand, buzz, that these were - this was the appearance of the material which had been uncovered by the rays that appeared darker for 2 or 3 feet extending outward. is that correct? 04 18 3849 lmp no. i wouldn't say it was necessarily material (tranq) that had been uncovered. i think some of the material might have been baked or in some way caused to be more cohesive and perhaps flow to- gether in some way, i don't know. now, in other areas, before we started trampling around out front, why, we could see that small erosion had taken place in a radially outward direction, but it had left no significant mark on the surface other than just having eroded it away. now, it was different back in the - right under the skirt itself. it seems as though the surface had been baked in a streak fashion, and i think a couple of pictures on film will show this. bl.tthat didn't extend out very far. over."
"roger, tranquility. and this baked appearance that you described, at least the suggestion is that it was due to the heat of the engine at any rate. next subject, did - -"

"roger. understand the description there. and the next subject, on the two core tubes which you collected, how did the driving fozce re- quired to collect these tubes eompare_ was there any difference? over"
"not significantly. i could get down to about (tranq) the first 2 inches without much of a problem, and then as i would pound it in about as hard as i could do it, and the second one took two hands on the han_ner, and i was putting pretty good dents in the top of the extension rod, and it just wouldn't go much more than - i think the total depth might haye been about 8 oz 9 inches. but even there, it didn't - for some reason it didn't seem to want to stand up straight. in other words, i'd keep driving it in and it would dig some sort of a hole but it wouldn't - just penetrate in a way that would support it and keep it from falling over, if that makes any sense at all. it didn't really to me. over."
"roger, buzz. i think i've got the picture. you indicate that little difference between the two samples and that in each case you got down about 2 inches without any problems and then had to continue hammering rather vigorously in order to continue driving it in to a total depth of 8 or 9 inches, and even at that point the rods did not want to stay vertical, that they'd tend to fall over on you even after pounding in that far. is that correct?"
"yes. that's about it. it wasn't a rapid change (tranq) in resistive force. and also i noticed when i took the bit off that the material was quite well packed, a good bit darker, and it - the way it adhered to the core tube gave me the distinct impression of being moist. over.

"yes, indeed. that'll be fine. just a couple more here, and i think these may not be quite as lengthy as number 7 there. can you estimate the stroke of the primary and secondary struts? over."
"well, i could do it like this, owen. about all (tranq) the struts are about equally stroked, and the height from the ground to the first step is about 3 feet or maybe 3 and 1/2 feet, huh?"
"roger. understand, neil. next topic, as - just after landing, you pointed out that there was a hill to the west along the plus-z axis from the lm. are there any large rocks in that direction that might block the solar ray during the sunset - as sunset approaches in your local- ity - are there any large rocks that might tend to obscure the ray? over."
"no. i don't believe so, i think that it's - (tranq) it's about as level as any other areas that we chose."
roger. i ---
"there's nothing large, anyway, that's going to (tranq) get in the way."
"roger. copy. that's also the way it appeared from the television,  think. and now the final question. you commented, neil, that on your approach to the landing spot, you had passed over a football field-sized crater containing rather large blocks of solid rock perhaps 10 to 15 feet in size. can you estimate the distance to this football-sized crater from yotu'present position? over.

be pleased to have it.
"roger, nell. starting off: congratulatory messages on the apollo ll mission have been pouring into the white house from world leaders in a steady stream all day. among the latest are telegrams from prime minister harold wilson of great britain and the king of belgium. the world's press has been dominated by news of apollo ll. some newsmen estimate that more than 60 percent of the news used in papers across the country today concerned your mission. the new york times which, as we mentioned before, has had such a demand for its edition of the paper today (even though it ran 950 000 copies) said it will reprint the whole thing on thursday as a souvenir edition. and premier alexei kosygin has sent congratulations to you and president nixon through former vice president humol_ey who is visiting russia. the cosmonauts have also issued a statement of congratulations. humphrey quoted kosygin as saying ""i want you to tell the president and the american people that the soviet union desires to work with the united states in the cause of peace."""
"and mrs. robert goddard said today that her husband would have been so happy. ""he wouldn't have shouted or anything. he would just have glowed."" she added, ""that was his dream, send- ing a rocket to the moon."" people around the world had many reasons to be happy about the apollo ll mission. the italian police reported that sunday night was the most crime-free night of the year. and in london, a boy who had the faith to bet $5 with a bookie that a man would reach the moon before 1970 collected $2h 000. that's pretty good odds.

"you're probably interested in the comments your wives have made. neil, jan had said about yes- terday's activities, ""the evening was unbelievably perfect. it is an honor and a privilege to share with my husband, the crew, the manned spacecraft center, the american public, and all mankind; the magnificent experience of the beginning of lunar exploration."" she was then asked if she considered the moon landing the greatest moment in her life. she said ""no, that was the day we were married."" and mike, pat said simply, ""it was fantastically marvelous."" buzz, joan said - apparently couldn't quite believe the eva on the moon. she said, ""it was hard to think it was real until the men actually moved. after the moon touchdown, i wept because i was so happy."" but she added, ""the best part of the mission will be the splashdown."""
"in other news, and there was a little bit, another explorer: thor heyerdahl had to give up his attempt to sail a papyrus boat across the atlantic. the storm-damaged boat was aban- doned about 650 miles from bermuda. the speed of the craft had been reduced to about 25 miles a day, and heyerdahl said the object of the voyage had not been to provide an endurance test for the crew."
"looking at the world of sports, let's see here. while you were busy the other day, joe namath and football commissioner pete rozelle made the announcement that ""broadway joe"" had agreed to sell his interest in the bachelors iii restau- rant and report to the new york jets. joe arrived at the jets' training camp todan and had his first workout. several other jet players who had held out along with joe also reported. and davy hill, from jackson, michigan, won his third major golf in as many starts in the past week. he won the philadelphia classic. hill has won four tournaments so far this year and is the leading money winner this year with a cool $129 000. and in baseball, the west division of the national league remains a tight race. la and san francisco are one game behind league-leading atlanta. the astros have a record of 48 wins and 48 losses, and are now in fifth place, seven games out. a twin bill between the astros and cincinnati last night was postponed because of rain. the chicago cubs (goss net 1) tape 85/3 are still in first place in the east division. they lead the new york mets by four and on_.-half games. and in the american league, baltimore is breezing toward the !',a'_tern division tjltt,. they lead second-place boston by 11 games. looking ahead, the all-star baseball game is scheduled for tomorrow. and president nixon was scheduled to see the game and then leave imme- diately after the game for the pacific splashdown area before going on his tour of europe. and that about covers the news this day. you guys have been making most of it and i'm sure we couldn't fill you in on any of the details that you don't already know. out."

"i should mention, bruce, that when i went to water secondary - water separator to secondary there, i didn't notice any change. but about after 15 minutes or 20 minutes, the water stopped coming out. so maybe that was just water that was already in the loop that was still blowing out, but the secondary water separator was operating properly."

"well, aside from the one big one that we went over, i guess there were none in our area. i took a stroll back after putting up the easep, and while buzz was starting to unpack the docu- mented samples - took a stroll back to a crater behind us that was maybe 70 or 80 feet illdiam- eter and 15 or 20 feet deep, and took solaepic- tures of it. it had rocks in the bottom of pretty good size, considerably bigger than any that were out on the surface, but there was no - we apparently, at 15 feet or so, had not gotten below the regolith. we were essentially showing no bedrock, at least in the walls of the crater at that depth. over."

"a 50-degree roll attitude will probably give us that, joe."
roger.
"that's a good one because it puts the earth out window 1 and the moon out window 3 and puts the sun down in the leb, so the lighting in here remains relatively constant."

"roger. this trip of ours to the moon may have looked, to you, simple or easy. i'd like to assure you that has _ot been the case. the saturn v rocket which put us into orbit is an incredibly complicated piece of machinery, every piece of which worked flawlessly. this computer up above my head has a 38 000-word vocabulary, each word of which has been very carefkllly chosen to be of the utmost value to us, the crew. this switch which i have in my hand now, has over 300 counterparts in the command module alone, this one single switch design. in add::tion to that, there are myrisds of circuit bre_,kers, levers, rods, and other associated con.rols. the sps engine, our large rocket engine on the aft end of our service module, must have performed flaw- lessly, or we would have been stranded in lunar orbit. the parachutes up above my heaa must work perfectly tomorrow or we will plur_net into the (goss net 1) tape 114/3 ocean. we have always ha(3 confidence that all this equipment will work, and work proper_y, and we continue to have confidence that it will do so for the remainder of the flight. ail this is possible only through the blood, sweat, and tears of a number of people. first, the american workmen who put these pieces of machinery to- gether in the factory. second, the painstaking work done by the various test te_m_ during the assembly and retest after assembly. and finally, the people at the manned spacecraft center, both in management, in mission planning, in flight control, and last, but not least, in crew training. this operation is somewhat like the periscope of a submarine. ail you see is the three of us, but beneath the surface are thousands _uadthou- sands of others, and to all those, i would like to say, thank you very much."

"good evening. i'd like to discuss with you a few of the more symbolic aspects of the flight of our mission, apollo 11. as we've been dis- cussing the events that have taken place in the past 2 or 3 days here on board our spacecraft, we've come to the conclusion that this has been far more than three men on a voyage to the moon; more, still, than the efforts of a government and industry team; more, even, than the efforts of one nation. we feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown. nell's statement the other day upon first setting foot on the surface of the moon, ""this is a small step for a man, but a great leap for mankind,"" i believe sum_ up these feelings very nicely. we accepted the challenge of going to the moon; the acceptance oj this challenge was inevita01e. the relatiw ease with which we carried out our mission, i be._ieve, is a tribute to the timeliness of that acteptance. today, i feel we're f_lly capable of accepting expanded roles in the exploration of stace. in retrospect, we have all been particularly pleased with the call signs that we very laboriously (goss net 1) _ape 112/4 chose for our spacecraft, columbia and eagle. we've been particularly pleased with the emblem of our flight, depicting the u.s. eagle bringing the universal symbol of peace from the earth, from the planet earth to the moon; that symbol being the olive branch. it was our overall crew choice to deposit a replica of this symbol on the moon. personally, in reflecting on the events of the past several days, a verse from psalms comes to mind to me. ""when i consider the heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained_ what is man that thou art mindful of him."""
"the responsibility for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort; next with the american people, who have thr,ugh their will, indicated their desire; next, _o four administrations, and their congresses, fol'implementing that will; and then, to the agel_cy and industry teams that built our spacecraft_ the saturn, the columbia, the eagle, and the 1 ttle emu, the space suit and backpack that wa._,our small spacecraft out on the lunar surfacer we would like to give a special thanks to al:those americans who built the spacecraft, who aid the construction, design, the tests, and put their - their hearts and all their abilities into those crafts. to those people, tonight, we give a special tha:zk you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight_ god bless you. _good night from apollo 11."
