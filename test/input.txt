En un primer post, os contamos toda la verdad sobre las bolas chinas. En él descubrimos cómo elegir una bolas chinas. En esta ocasión, te dejamos este articulo que explica muy bien, cuando se recomienda (o no) su uso, cómo ponerlas y qué hacer con ellas. Así que atenta!! Cómo poner las bolas chinas La postura para colocarlas es indiferente, se recomienda ponerlas con las rodillas y caderas flexionadas. Se deberían colocar como un tampón, al final de la vagina. Otra opción es colocarlas de pie, con un pie subido encima de un taburete para poder acceder de forma fácil a la entrada de la vagina, siempre introduciéndola hasta el final. Poner un poco de lubricante de base acuosa si es necesario para favorecer el introducirlas. Nunca debe doler el introducir una bola china, si duele, puede ser que sea demasiado grande o que los músculos del suelo pélvico estén hipertónicos, con demasiada tensión muscular. Por ello, siempre su uso debe ser supervisado por un fisioterapeuta. Cuándo se recomienda usar las bolas chinas Realmente las podría usar cualquier mujer sana que tenga un minimo de tono y fuerza en su musculatura del suelo pélvico. Esto ultimo solo se puede saber tras una valoración funcional. Si una mujer tiene una hipotonía ( poco tono) de su musculatura y comienza a usar las bolas chinas, seguramente se le caerán y su situación empeorará. Estaria recomendado su uso : Como prevención antes de quedarnos embarazadas para tener un suelo pélvico tonificado. Tras dar a luz, una vez pasada la cuarentena y una vez que nos hayamos hecho una valoración. Generalmente tras dar a luz, la vagina se queda mas laxa, la apertura vaginal es mas grande y la musculatura del suelo pélvico hipotónica, asi que son muchas las mujeres que cuando toman la decisión de usar las bolas sin una valoración previa lo que les pasa es que se les salen, con la consiguiente frustación que esto crea es por ello que vamos a aclarar.. Mujeres adultas que realizan deportes hiperpresivos (correr, tenis…) que debilitan su suelo pélvico deben compensar con algún ejercicio especifico de suelo pélvico (aparte del uso de bolas hay otros ejercicios hipopresivos que deberían hacer estas mujeres ). Como prevención para la aparición de sintomatología como prolapsos, incontinencia durante la menopausia. No una vez que hayan aparecido ya!!! Mujeres con estreñimiento . Estos casos requieren siempre una valoración previa . Como ayuda en el tratamiento de las incontinencias de esfuerzo, mixtas, tras dar a luz y en disfunciones sexuales provocadas por debilidad siempre siguiendo las instrucciones del terapeuta que nos este tratando, nunca antes porque podemos empeorar el cuadro clínico. Cuando NO se recomienda el uso de las bolas chinas Embarazo. La musculatura de suelo pélvico ya soporta el aumento de peso del utero durante la gestación teniendo en cuenta también el componente hormonal de laxitud. Suelo pélvico muy hipotónico que no son capaces de realizar una contracción normal (Kegel). Prolapsos a partir del grado 2 ( en grado 1 habría siempre que valorar) Hipertonias del suelo pélvico . Antes de poder usar las bolas chinas, habrá que tratar esa musculatura para quitar la hipertonía y a partir de ahí empezaremos a fortalecer. Dolor Tras dar a luz sin haber hecho una valoración previa Tras cirugía pélvica sin haber hecho valoración previa Como hemos dicho antes, en fisioterapia, las bolas chinas las usaremos para aumentar el tono, ya que la vibración que produce una bola contenida en otra estimula esa contracción involuntaria. Un suelo pélvico tónico es capaz de mantener las vísceras pélvicas en su sitio (evitando los prolapsos) y mantener la continencia, sin que nosotros realicemos una contracción voluntaria del mismo. Cuanto debo llevarlas puestas y cómo trabajar con las bolas chinas Lo ideal es empezar por 10 minutos al dia e ir aumentando el tiempo. No se recomienda tener puestas las bolas chinas más de tres horas al dia, el exceso de contracción puede aumentar demasiado el tono y ser perjudicial. Una vez introducidas debemos trabajar con ellas puestas de modo que aumentemos la dificultad de los ejercicios Kegel . Podemos hacer ejercicos solo de contraer suelo pélvico y relajar, podemos contraer manteniendo la contracción unos segundos y relajar o también contraer en dos o tres veces contrayendo cada vez un poco mas (como dibujando una escalera con nuestra contracción ). ¿Realmente, son efectivas? Usándolas de forma correcta, es decir buscando la bola china adecuada a cada mujer y durante el tiempo correspondiente, los resultados son muy satisfactorios. Resumen antes de comprar unas bolas chinas: – Realizar una valoración del suelo pélvico para de

Nuevas medidas de transparencia para anuncios sobre temas sociales en Chile y México | Acerca de Meta En Facebook creemos que las personas deben de poder saber quiénes son responsables de los anuncios que ven en Facebook e Instagram, especialmente durante procesos electorales. Es por eso que en los últimos meses hemos lanzado herramientas que brindan mayor transparencia a la publicidad política y electoral en América Latina. Hoy, presentamos nuevas medidas para ayudar a proteger la integridad de las próximas elecciones en Chile y México. A partir de mediados de abril, los anunciantes de estos países que quieran implementar publicidad de temas sociales en Facebook e Instagram tendrán que pasar por el mismo proceso de autorización que pedimos para anuncios electorales y políticos. Lo anterior contempla identificar a un individuo o entidad como responsable de la publicación pagada y mostrar un descargo de responsabilidad con la etiqueta «Pagado por" en la misma.

Los rumores apuntan a una serie centrada en Mos Eisley Publicado el 15 Septiembre 2019, 19:03 0 Desde hace ya varios meses, los fans de la película "Han Solo" han seguido una férrea campaña pidiendo a Disney una secuela. Y es que, aunque la primera entrega no resultó tan bien como se esperaba de un personaje tan carismático, tampoco se dio un excesivo desencanto. Y aunque la Casa del Ratón no tiene planes (al menos por ahora) de retomar la historia del contrabandista, sí que podría sacar un nuevo spin-off de la película. El rumor lo ha lanzado la web Star Wars Unity, de Jeremy Conrad. Aunque por el momento no hay nada oficial, Conrad es conocido por hacerse con la primicia de muchas series y películas tanto de Mar

Hola buenas tardes, tengo una consulta de inmigracion, quiero Hola buenas tardes, tengo una consulta de inmigracion, quiero saber si aplico para solicitar un residencia por ajute cubano, mis abuelos son cubanos por nacimiento y mi mama es Venezolana pero se hizo cubana y tiene su certificado de nacimiento cubano, yo soy Venezolana puedo aplicar? soy casada y con un hijo de 6 anos. La mama de usted ya tiene el ajuste cubano? Usted es ciudadana venezolana? Hola Dr. Mi mama no tiene su ajuste de cubana ella tiene su certificado de nacimiento como cubana pero es nacida en venezuela igual que yo. Yo hace dos anos consulte con ud mismo el caso pero mi mama no habia sacado su nacionalidad cubana y ahora si ya la tiene. le anexo una copia de la partina de nacimiento de mi mama como cubana Bueno, ahora la mama de usted puede acudir a EEUU y beneficiarse del ajuste cubano, pero en el caso de usted no es directo porque usted no puede aplicar, porque se hace necesario que usted tambien tenga su certificado de nacimiento como cubana. En este caso, lo recomendable es que primero lo haga su mama y despues de adquirir la Residencia la pida a usted como hija de ella. Ose

Venezuela denunció la inacción del Consejo de Seguridad ante el expansionismo de Israel 15/10/12 - www.aporrea.org/actualidad/n216290.html 15/10/12.-Venezuela denunció este lunes la falta de acción del Consejo de Seguridad ante la política expansionista de Israel en los territorios palestinos ocupados debido a la amenaza de veto por Estados Unidos y sus aliados. Al hablar en una sesión del Consejo de Seguridad sobre la situación en el Medio Oriente, el representante permanente de Venezuela ante la ONU, Jorge Valero, advirtió frente al incremento de la volatilidad y la violencia en esa región como un serio riesgo para la paz mundial. Dijo que algunos miembros de ese órgano "suelen inhibirse ante las evidentes amenazas a la paz y la seguridad internacional del gobierno de Israel", al tiempo que alientan conflictos que deberían ser resueltos por la mediación y el diálogo, como el caso de Siria. Esas conductas guerreristas ponen en entredicho la institucionalidad de Nacion

Los criterios generales para la evaluación final serán los siguientes: 1.- Una prueba objetiva tipo test, de 20 preguntas. 2.- Cada pregunta tendrá una única respuesta verdadera, o una más correcta, a elegir de entre tres. 3.- No penalizan los errores. 4.- Las calificaciones corresponderán a un valor de 0,5 puntos por cada pregunta respondida correctamente. La fecha de entrega quedará determinada cada curso académico en función del calendario lectivo que aparezca en la guía. El examen tiene como finalidad valorar la adquisición de las competencias específicas y genéricas asociadas a la asignatura "Ejercicio Profesional y organización colegial", básicamente el nivel y grado de conocimiento teórico y práctico adquirido por los estudiantes, su capacidad sintética, al destacar y describir las cuestiones formuladas con un lenguaje técnico-jurídico. Su formulación, diseño y evaluación es competencia exclusiva de los miembros del Equipo docente de la Sede central. La prueba objetiva (test de respuestas múltiples) deberá realizarse a través de la plataforma educativa Alf, o fórmula equivalente, donde está el curso virtualizado. No estará disponible para los alumnos y alumnas hasta su fecha de realización (segunda o tercera semana de febrero). Las fechas concretas serán comunicadas con la debida antelación en la plataforma virtual y en principio las realizarán el día indicado accediendo al icono que estará ese día activado denominado "TAREAS", cabe la posibilidad de que, en su caso se las enviaremos a su correo uned (y al correo privado para evitar problemas que puedan sobrevenir en la plataforma) de modo que lo tendrán que tener activado, siguiendo para ello las indicaciones que figuran en el foro de mensajes básicos. Final exam weighing in final grade No procede Approximate submission date 20/02/2018 Puede utilizar los materiales que estime por conveniente, teniendo en cuenta que el examen es un ejercicio personal e intransferible, cuya realización es personalísima y de responsabilidad exclusiva del alumno o alumna que lo suscribe, estando naturalmente vetada la posibilidad de realizarlo en grupo, compartir respuestas, o "colgarlas" en foro o medio alguno que permita el acceso a su examen en el tiempo destinado a su contestación. La realización de este examen, implica la aceptación de que su autoría es única y singular de quien ha puesto sus datos Tengan en cuenta que, como ya hemos señalado, la asignatura exige un buen conocimiento del ordenamiento jurídico propio de la profesión, de modo tal que una de las destrezas básicas irá dirigida al correcto manejo de dichas normas. Sobre todo se recomiendan las actividades participativas en la plataforma educativa, en particular en los denominados foros de debate, sea en la intervención en los Foros de encuentro (en el Curso virtual), donde intercambiar conocimientos, dudas e impresiones y con sus compañeros y compañeras, y desde luego el recurso a la solución de las dudas planteadas a través de medios telemáticos. Estas actividades contribuyen enormemente a acortar distancias, y con la resolución progresiva de dudas y consultas nos llevan a conseguir un sistema de aprendizaje colaborativo, en el que algunos estudiantes podrán resolver las dudas de otros. Este reto personal y universitario se ha revelado como altamente eficaz para la preparación de la materia y la maduración de contenidos. A mayor abundamiento tratándose como es el c

'Generación 2018', entre explorar lo distinto y redisponer lo existente La Casa Encencida en Madrid expone la 18 edición de Generaciones, dedicada a artistas emergentes 10/02/2018 - 20:32h La casa Encendida. Generación 2018. Generaciones en La Casa Encendida y Circuitos en la Sala de Arte Joven de la comunidad de Madrid son citas importantes. No hay más echar una ojeada a su historia (esta es la decimoctava edición de Generaciones y será la vigesimonovena de Circuitos) para darse cuenta de que por ambas y muchas veces en ambas, han pasado bastantes de los artistas que hoy están en cualquier conversación. Sin embargo, en los últimos años es posible detectar cierto escepticismo en la crítica. Repasando lo escrito sobre ediciones anteriores se desprende un cierto sentimiento de déjà vu , de que esto en realidad no avanza. En realidad, cabría preguntarse y de hecho se ha preguntado cien mil veces, si no estamos ante la muerte de la pintura y la escultura. Suena un poco como la canción de R.E.M. It's the end of the world (as we know it). R.E.M. añadían And I feel fine. Una de las piezas que se muestran en esta Generación introduce muy bien el tema. Umbral, de Serafín Álvarez (1985) viene a ser un pequeño grotto, típicos en los jardines pudientes desde el Renacimiento y en muchos jardines públicos de finales del XIX y principios del XX. Dentro de la pequeña gruta y sin lugar para sentarse hay un monitor y una fuente de sonido. Lo que se muestra igual sorprende a algunos visitantes del arte, pero resultará de lo más familiar para millones y millones de adicionados a los videojuegos. Se trata de lo que en los juegos suele llamarse un paisaje abierto por el que el jugador puede deambular con plena libertad recorriendo entornos generados digitalmente. En la isla hay cuevas, desiertos o junglas y todo tipo de objetos que se refieren a hitos de la ciencia ficción como 2001, Dune o El Planeta Salvaje. Umbral es un juego que recuerda a algunos como Dear Esther (2012) en el cual la acción es mínima: reconstruir una historia a través de las cartas dejadas en una isla desierta en las Hébridas por Esther. El juego recibió muchísimos premios y suscitó la discusión en torno a si en realidad era un videojuego o una obra literaria. Que también habría respondido a una forma distinta de entender la literatura. Umbral está aquí como obra de arte, como todo lo que entra en un museo (Duchamp dixit). Pero en realidad tiene más sentido frente al propio ordenador o televisor asumiendo el control que en LCE se ha cedido a un algoritmo. En todo caso se plantea una pregunta: ¿cuantas personas que hace solo unos años se habrían dedicado a pintar habrán dirigido su actividad a estos terrenos? Hacia unos videojuegos que ahora llegan a plantear cuestiones morales bastante duras o a desmontar jugando las teorías libertariano-capitalistas de una Ayn Rand. Serafín Álvarez. Umbral, 2018. La Casa Encendida. Generación 2018 El resto de Generación 2018 parece arte tal y como lo hemos conocido en los últimos tiempos y que también va perfilándose. Se trata de algo que bien podría llamarse freeform, como algunas corrientes en la música y que suele incorporar elementos que antes solían presentarse aislados. Casi todo en Generación 2018 respondería a esa idea. José Díaz (1981) explora las posibilidades de una pintura en cuya presentación aparece la palabra informalista (término europeo surgido en la segunda mitad del siglo XX para reunir todo tipo de prácticas poco o nada realistas). Pero José Díaz, como otros pintores y pintoras de hoy, no se conforma con su propia subjetividad concibe la pintura como un elemento casi constructivo o más bien planimétrico relacionado con situaciones genéricas, en esta pieza la M-30 de Madrid, una vivencia muy común. Lo de Antonio Gagliano (1982), Sistema Nacional de innovación, es interesante porque se basa en algo muy industrial, muy de la época en que surgió la actual idea de la pintura y del aura de obra única: las imágenes presentadas junto a las patentes. Algunas son antiguas como una chistera que se transforma en bombín de 1878 o una de 1925 sobre obtención de dibujos animados por transparencia (fundamental en el desarrollo del género). Otras son más contemporáneas como un panel solar hecho de vacío de 2013. Está bien, con un punto retro en que ideas muy locas se unen a piezas que realmente significaron un progreso técnico. Irene Grau (1986) viaja bastante y desde hace un ti

¡Qué maravillosa primera sesión de conferencia general hemos tenido! Me sentí renovado espiritualmente mientras escuchaba a los que hablaron. Fueron absolutamente inspiradores, y estoy seguro de que las próximas cuatro sesiones serán igualmente maravillosas. Algunos notaron que me senté en una silla para entregar mi mensaje esta mañana. ¡Qué ayuda fue esa! El otro día se me ocurrió que he estado vivo durante casi la mitad de los años desde que la Iglesia de Jesucristo de los Santos de los Últimos Días se organizó en 1830. Eso es un montón de años, aunque no me sienta viejo. Mi esposa Wendy insiste en que todavía no puede hacerme actuar de mi edad. Pero admitiré que a veces incluso pequeños ajustes, como una s

Hackear las imágenes de los mapas I - VHPlab Martes 13 de mayo de 2008, por Horacio González Diéguez. González Diéguez, Horacio. Hackear las imágenes de los mapas I [online]. Santiago de Compostela, España, VHPlab, mayo de 2008 [versión de diciembre de 2008] [Consultado el ]. Disponible en Internet: https://www.vhplab.net/spip.php?article18 Es posible cargar las imágenes de google directamente en una aplicación si se conoce su URL, para poder hacerlo solo es necesario saber como están codificadas dichas URL. En el caso de los mapas resulta bastante sencillo, la siguiente URL conduce a la imagen del mapa de santiago: http://mt3.google.com/mt?x=487&y=376&zoom=7 * Como se puede observar las variables x e y indican la posición en un array de imágenes que contiene todo el mapa del mundo. La variable indica el tamaño de ampliacion del mapa; cuanto menor sea zoom, que puede tomar valores entre o y 17, mayor será el tamaño del mapa y por lo tanto mayor el array de imágenes. Los siguientes enlaces corresponden a una serie de mapas que se hicieron con el fin de rastrear la posición de puntos e imágenes en los mapas, medida tanto en píxeles como en latitud y longitud. coordenadas-pixels-1.html coordenadas-pixels-2.html coordenadas-pixels-3.html coordenadas-pixels-4.html coordenadas-pixels-5.html coordenadas-pixels-6.html La forma de encontrar la url de una imagen concreta del mapa es sencilla, simplemente es necesario calcular las coordenadas en píxeles de la imagen, restarle el resto de su división entre 256 y dividir de nuevo entre 256. Todos los ejemplos se basan en algo tan sencillo como esta función: // calculamos las coordenadas en pixeles del punto central del mapa var offset = mapa.getCurrentMapType().getProjection().fromLatLngToPixel(center, zoom); /* para conocer las coordenadas de la imagen que le corresponde, calculamos el resto de su división entre 256 */ var restox = offset.x%256; var restoy = offset.y%256; /* al restar el resto y dividir entre 256 las coordenadas del centro obtendremos la posición x e y de la imagen del mapa */ var imgx = (offset.x - restox)/256; var imgy = (offset.y - restoy)/256; //si el mapa se encuentra en modo mapa político la url de la imagen será la siguuiente var url1 = "http://mt3.google.com/mt?n=404&x=" + imgx + "&y=" + imgy + "&zoom=" + (17 - zoom); //si el mapa se encuentra en modo mapa físico la url de la imagen será la siguuiente var url2 = "http://mt0.google.com/mt/v=app.81&x=" + imgx + "&y=" + imgy + "&z=" + zoom; Sin embargo las URL se las imágenes de satellite están mucho más codificadas y resulta algo mas dificil utilizarlas. Se ha utilizado la información procedente de esta web para comprender como funciona dicha codificación y elaborar los siguientes scripts. La url de las imagenes tipo satélite está codificada como una secuencia de "q", "r", "t" y "s". Para una determinada region del mapa cada una de las letras significa hacer zoom en uno de los cuatro cuadrantes. "q" es el cuadrante "noroeste" (arriva a la izquierda), "r" es el cuadrante "noreste" (arriva a la derecha), "s" es el cuadrante "sureste" (abajo a la derecha) y "t" es el cuadrante "sudoeste" (abajo a la izquierda). La primera región es el mapa completo del planeta y tiene asignada la siguiente URL: http://kh0.google.com/kh?n=404&v=26&t=t. Como el primer nivel de zoom consta de una sola imagen y se le ha asignado la letra "t", el siguiente nivel consta de cuatro imágenes; tq, tr, tt y ts. Se procede del mismo modo agregando sucesivamente una letra para cada nivel de

A Tener en CuentaGalería de ImágenesNoticiasTe RecomendamosVirus y Pandemias Pero los científicos dicen que hay muchos más problemas que nos acechan y que algún día podríamos encontrarnos ante una súper pandemia a nivel mundial que podría acabar con la humanidad. Todo lo que necesitas es un par de "trucos" biológicos para convertir un virus microscópico en un asesino furioso como el virus de la gripe española de 1918 que mató a 50 y 100 millones de personas, o el virus SARS que comenzó en China en 2003 y se extendió a 37 países en sólo unas pocas semanas. Con el tiempo, mató al menos a 800 personas. Este año, existen dos contagios que están preocupando a los mejores epidemiólogos, son un virus asiático llamado H7N9, y MERS, o síndrome respiratorio del Oriente Medi

Farándula magazine – 7 lugares en Michigan que debes de visitar en el 2021 Desde las imponentes dunas de arena natural en la costa occidental hasta el borde urbano de Detroit, Michigan es un estado agradable para explorar. Cada región tiene paisajes únicos y diversos, con experiencias que cambian con cada estación. El invierno significa ir a las pistas de Traverse City y explorar el paraíso helado de la península superior. La primavera es cuando Ann Arbor y Grand Rapids se despiertan para invitar a los viajeros a pasear por las pintorescas calles y disfrutar de una cena en el patio al aire libre. El verano significa unas vacaciones antiguas en la isla Mackinac y nadar en las aguas del lago Michigan. El otoño es el momento ideal para recorrer las pintorescas carreteras de la parte superior de Michigan para vislumbrar por primera vez los colores de las hojas cambiantes. Hay algunos destinos excelentes en el estado, desde pintorescos hasta románticos y emocionantes. Planifique sus viajes con nuestra lista de los mejores lugares para visitar en Michigan. Mackinac Island es uno de los mejores lugares para vacacionar en Michigan. La experiencia en la isla recuerda a unas antiguas vacaciones de verano, con mecedoras en el porche; paseos a caballo y en carruajes; y una quietud sobre el lago Huron, con fascinantes puestas de sol que ponen un sello dramático al final de un día memorable. Solo se puede acceder a esta tranquila isla en la península superior de Michigan en ferry y no hay automóviles, por lo que los vacacionistas disfrutan de la simplicidad de andar en bicicleta y caminar por las calles del vecindario. Las actividades en la isla Mackinac van desde paseos en kayak y paseos a caballo hasta un crucero en barco al atardecer bajo el puente Mackinac. Detroit, Michigan | Photo courtesy of Josh Garcia La energía en Detroit es contagiosa. La ciudad tiene un ambiente que proviene de sus raíces en Motor City en la industria del transporte. Algunas de las mejores cosas que hacer en Detroit se relacionan con esa historia, como el museo Henry Ford, el Salón de la Fama Automotriz y el Complejo Patrimonial Automotriz Ford Piquette Avenue Plant / Model T. Otras visitas obligatorias incluyen el Museo Motown y la Parade Company, donde puede realizar un recorrido detrás de escena de disfraces y carrozas diseñados para el Desfile de Acción de Gracias de Michigan. La Detroit moderna tiene barrios de moda para visitar en busca de experiencias gastronómicas y artísticas, como Midtown y Rivertown. Eastern Market es un lugar divertido para visitar, con más de 150 años de historia; es una de las mejores cosas para hacer en el sur de Michigan. El mercado al aire libre es el mercado público histórico más grande de los Estados Unidos. Frankenmuth, Michigan, United States | Photo by Aaron Burden on Unsplash La región de la Bahía de los Grandes Lagos en el centro de Michigan es un lugar tranquilo ideal para escapadas románticas y para familias. Es una región agrícola, con varias comunidades que tienen experiencias para disfrutar, desde mercados de agricultores y tiendas de antigüedades hasta recreación al aire libre y galerías de arte. Hay más de 100 millas de senderos para caminatas y paseos escénicos, y parques que son populares para la observación de aves. Una de las visitas que tienes que hacer en el área de Great Lakes Bay es la caminata de canopy más larga en los Estados Unidos ubicada en Whiting Forest en Midland. La ciudad de Saginaw es un gran lugar para alojarse en la región, ya que tiene un mercado público, un zoológico para niños, un museo de arte y recorridos ecológicos en el Refugio Nacional de Vida Silvestre Shiawassee. La ciudad de Frankenmuth es una de las más conocidas de la Bahía de los Grandes Lagos. Es una ciudad turística creada para replicar un pequeño pueblo bávaro. Frankenmuth es conocida por sus festivales, cenas de pollo en el restaurante Bavarian Inn y la mundialmente famosa tienda navideña CHRISTmas Wonderland. Para permanecer en el centro de todo, el Bavarian Inn Lodge es una opción popular porque lo mantiene cerca de todo. La península superior es uno de los mejores lugares para visitar en Michigan en invierno. Con 200 pulgadas de nieve cada año, esta región del norte se convierte en un patio de recreo para la recreación al aire libre en invierno. Puede reservar un fin de semana en una de las varias docenas de estaciones de esquí o recorrer una de las muchas pistas de esquí de fondo acondicionadas a través de los bosques de la UP. La Península Superior es un gran lugar para probar nuevas aventuras invernales, como escalada en hielo, trineos tirados por perros y raquetas de nieve. El paisaje es impresionante, con estructuras cubiertas de hielo como faros, cascadas heladas, acantilados con acentos de hielo a lo largo de la costa nacional del lago Pictured Rocks y festivales de invierno. Quizás una de las mejores razones para ir a Michigan's UP en invierno es el acogedor alojamiento, donde puede terminar el día calentándose junto a la chimenea. Cheboygan Crib Light, built in 1884, Lake Huron, Michigan, USA La ciudad de Cheboygan Northeast Michigan se considera la puerta de entrada a las vías fluviales porque es el punto de acceso al sistema de vías navegables interiores del estado. El Inland Waterway es una ruta de 42 millas a lo largo de tres ríos y varios lagos que comienza en Cheboygan y termina en Conway. El terreno público cerca de Cheboygan lo convierte en un excelente lugar para actividades al aire libre, como caminatas en verano y acceso a pistas de esquí en invierno. Es uno de los mejores lugares para experimentar la tranquila soledad de la naturaleza salvaj

El TSJ dispuso la implementación de la notificación electrónica en la Justicia electoral. Será de carácter obligatorio a partir del 18 de febrero próximo. – Patagonia JUDICIAL Inicio›Regional›Neuquén›El TSJ dispuso la implementación de la notificación electrónica en la Justicia electoral. Será de carácter obligatorio a partir del 18 de febrero próximo. Neuquén: El Tribunal Superior de Justicia aprobó el reglamento de la notificación electrónica en el ámbito de la Justicia electoral y dispuso su implementación, en forma obligatoria, a partir del 18 de febrero próximo. A fin de llevar adelante la misma, la Secretaría Electoral deberá organizar la charla informativa que se brindará a los usuarios del servicio para que se familiaricen con la herramienta, como ya se hizo con la implementación en los fueros Civil y Penal. Los sujetos alcanzados serán aquellas personas jurídico políticas previstas en el art. 2 de la Ley Provincial de Partidos Políticos (Nº 716), donde se indica que "Los partidos políticos que se reconozcan como tales tendrán personalidad de carácter jurídico-política y serán personas del Derecho privado". También abarca a las Alianzas "formadas y vigentes y/o en formación, con tramite de admisibilidad ya dispuesta" y a toda persona que actúe "por sí o por terceros en el ejercicio de derechos contenidos en la Legislación Electoral Provincial, ante el Juzgado Electoral", según se indicó en el punto 9 del acuerdo Nº 5237, aprobado el 4 de febrero pasado. Todos los sujetos mencionados deberán constituir domicilio electrónico. Lo gestionarán ante el Poder Judicial, indicando el Partido Político o Alianza según corresponda, mediante una presentación en la Secretaría Electoral, quien previa certificación de la existencia y vigencia de la persona jurídica que realiza la solicitud, la remitirá a la Secretaría de Superintendencia.

La noble y leal cuidad de Alcalá la Real, según reza en su título, está situada al sur de la provincia de Jaén, en la confluencia con las de Córdoba y Granada, sobre una amplia meseta dominada por el Cerro de la Mota, en el centro de una comarca montañosa cubierta de olivares. A los pies del famoso Castillo de la Mota y de las murallas circundantes, su estructura urbana de origen árabe, sus calles empinadas, sus casas señoriales, iglesias y detalles arquitectónicos, muestran su esplendor y su rico pasado histórico. Hermosa villa enclavada en el suroeste de la provincia de Jaén, en la zona de conexión con las provincias de Córdoba y Granada, al pie de la Sierra Ahillos. Su paisaje está determinado por fuertes pendientes y áreas de vega en torno a cursos fluviales, entre la campiña del Guadalquivir y las sierras Subbéticas. El casco urbano de origen medieval, se asienta sobre un cerro coronado por el Castillo Calatravo del s. XIII, a su vez edificado sobre el alcázar almohade. Rutas turístico-monumentales (10 Km.) Almedinilla, (20 Km.) Priego, (25 Km.) Alcalá la Real (25 Km.) Alcaudete, (30 Km.) Cabra, (38 Km.) Lucena, Rute, Iznajar, y a poco más, Jaén, Granada, Córdoba. Rutas de senderismo guiadas, (guias titulados y especializados) para conocer realmente a fondo la subbética; en 4x4, mountain bike y a caballo. (más información en MUSGAÑO, Tlf: 616 25 95 10. Ver, en Priego, todos los sábados del año por la noche (medianoche), los Hermanos de la Aurora recorrer la ciudad, cantando coplas populares de sabor ancestral. Fiestas y ferias patronales (según fechas).Semana Santa en Priego, una de las de máximo relieve de la comarca. Festivales internacionales de Música, Danza y Teatro en Priego. (julio-agosto)Bajada (4 de septiembre) y subida (primer domingo de octubre) en Romería de la Virgen de la Sierra en Cabra. LAPIAZ DE LOS LANCHARES. Situado en el macizo de Cabra, constituye una superficie estructural en el borde de la carretera Cabra-Priego, dominando el polje de La Nava. Los Lanchares enlozados de rocas agrietadas, juegan con colores de malva y bermellón entre el verde ceniza del romero. LOS HOYONES. Se encuentra en la Sierra de las Jarcas, al Sur de la carretera Cabra-Priego. Aparecen una veintena de dolinas, algunas con un desarrollo espectacular. Son de forma variada, predominando en embudo , artesa o en barril con fondo plano y pedregoso. LA NAVA.Denominada "Llanos de la Virgen de la Sierra", al pie del picacho en el que se asienta la ermita, se trata de poljes contiguos La Nava y el Valle de la Fuenseca, La Nava es un espacioso y deleitoso llano, cercado de altas sierras por cuyas llanura corre un caudaloso arroyo "El Bailón". LA SIMA DE CABRA. Abismo vertical de un centenar de metros de profundidad, al cual alude Cervantes en el Quijote. PICACHO DE LA ERMITA DE LA VIRGEN DE LA SIERRA.Declarado sitio de interés nacional en 1929, desde el que se puede gozar de todo el paisaje andaluz. CUEVA DE LOS MURCIÉLAGOS. Es el ejemplo más interesante de las numerosas grutas y cuevas Kársticas que aparecen en todo el macizo. Se abre en una cuesta caliza a una altura de 300 m. sobre el pueblo de Zuheros. Esta constituida por una gran grieta que se abre en varias galerías que dan acceso a salas de varios tamaños, algunas llenas de estalactitas y estalagmitas de gran belleza. Existen arduos debates sobre cada cuánto tiempo es necesario lavar un edredón. Sin embargo, todas las partes coinciden en que es vital mantenerlo día a día con una serie de cuidados específicos. Y para cuidar nuestro edredón es necesario andar pendiente de él en invierno, que es cuando más lo usamos, pero también en verano, ya que no se debe dejar el edredón de cualquier forma en un armario. Es necesario doblarlo cuidadosamente e introducirlo en su embalaje original, ya que este fue creado con dicha intención. Una vez hecho esto, el edredón se colocará en un lugar fresco y seco. Del mismo modo, y tal y como sucede con colchas, fundas nórdicas o mantas, es necesario que el aire fresco del exterior entre en contacto con nuestro edredón de vez en cuando. Para ello, es buena idea tenerlo en el balcón o la terraza de manera horizontal. Igualmente, es positivo sacudir el edredón a diario para eliminar ácaros y demás microorganismos que puedan llegar a dañarlo. Por último, y aunque se da por descontado, el uso de lejía o po

Inicia este 2022, con candado extra de seguridad para tu información - América Retail Inicio Ecommerce Inicia este 2022, con candado extra de seguridad para tu información Inicia este 2022, con candado extra de seguridad para tu información Moises Gormes- Director, Omni Payments Mexico & Hispanic Markets LATAM at PayPal Cada comienzo de año es una muy buena oportunidad de replantear nuestros objetivos y mejorar en diversos aspectos. Una de las metas de inicio de año puede ser tener una mejor salud financiera y una buena medida para ello es tener el conocimiento para evitar ser víctimas de fraude. De acuerdo con datos de Market Intelligence, el mercado de seguridad cibernética de América Latina se valoró en USD 14,62 mil millones en 2022 y se espera que alcance los USD 37,92 mil millones para 2027. Tomando esto en consideración, sabemos que el fraude esta a la orden y que cada vez existen más técnicas sofisticadas de robo de información y fraude. Por ello, en PayPal te compartimos los siguientes consejos para ponerle un candado extra de seguridad a tu información financiera desde ahora. A continuación, tres consejos para cuidar de tu información financiera Ten cuidado con los correos electrónicos falsificados Normalmente los correos electrónicos falsos o de phishing que pudieran llegar a tu email tienen por objetivo robar tu información financiera y/o personal, como contraseñas y números de cuenta. Estos correos los utilizan como un medio engañoso para pedirte que respondas con tus datos personales o hagas clic en algún enlace que les permita robar tu información. Por ello, si llegaras a recibir algún correo o mensaje como éste, no lo abras, no hagas clic en algún enlace, ni proporciones información personal a un tercero. Ignora mensajes de texto urgentes Los correos no son el único medio que llegan a utilizar los estafadores, por ello también debes estar alerta de los mensajes de voz o SMS que puedan resultar sospechosos. A este tipo de fraude se le conoce como smishing. Comúnmente los defraudadores envían un mensaje de texto con un número de teléfono o un URL falso con un mensaje con un fuerte sentido de urgencia. Por lo general, suenan así: "Su cuenta ha sido suspendida o bloqueada debido una actividad sospechosa detectada. Comuníquese con nosotros inmediatamente al 1-408-123-4567. Es imperativo que hablemos con usted lo antes posible». «Gastaste MX$15,000 en la Tienda X. Si no realizó esta transacción, inicie sesión en mitiendax.mobileservice2013.com/txn?id=178948 para detener esta transacción. Gracias». Cuando recibes algún mensaje de este tipo, donde te piden llamar a algún número o hacer clic en un enlace y lo haces, puedes estar confirmando a los estafadores que tienes una cuenta determinada. Y, además, cuando hablas al número indicado tratando de resolver el "problema" puedes terminar compartiendo tu información personal y/o financiera a las manos equivocadas. No compartas tu información de cuenta con terceros Los estafadores a veces usan un sistema automatizado para hacer llamadas de voz, en el que te informan "problemas urgentes" sobre tu cuenta y te solicitan información de tu cuenta. Esto se llama vishing y aquí hay un ejemplo de cómo podría sonar una llamada de vishing: «Éste es Empresa X informando una posible transacción fraudulenta en su cuenta. Ingrese su PIN ahora para escuchar los detalles de la transacción. Necesitamos su respuesta inmediata para bloquear esta transacción». Si llegarás a introducir tu PIN o contraseña durante esta llamada, estarías compartiendo con los defraudadores información vital de cómo ingresar a tu cuenta. Entonces, si recibes una llamada a nombre de la empresa o incluso si el identificador de llamadas dice «Empresa X», nunca debes proporcionar ninguna información de tu cuenta por teléfono. Incluso hay veces que las llamadas automatizadas pueden pedirte que devuelvas la llamada, compartiéndote un número donde sea más fácil enviarte un enlace o un número para robar tus datos personales. Protegernos del fraude requiere tecnología, herramientas y profesionales con conocimiento que estén capacitados par

El dueño de los hoteles Riu, en libertad bajo fianza tras ser acusado de sobornar a un funcionario para que acelerara unos permisos Madrid / Colpisa 14/02/2018 05:00 h El empresario Luis Riu Güell, consejero delegado y copropietario de la cadena de hoteles Riu, fue detenido ayer en Miami acusado de un delito de corrupción al intentar presuntamente sobornar a un funcionario mediante alojamiento gratis a cambio de que acelerara unos permisos para la reforma de un hotel ubicado en Miami Beach. Unas horas después de su arresto, el alto ejecutivo quedó en libertad tras abonar la fianza de 20.000 dólares (16.180 euros) que le había sido impuesta por el juez. Según fuentes de la compañía, Luis Riu se trasladó desde España a la ciudad estadounidense y se presentó voluntariamente en los juzgados. Allí compareció y le comunicaron los cargos que le imputan. Posteriormente abonó la fianza, que había sido acordada previamente. Un procedimiento que, insistieron desde la compañía, es el habitual en e

Sanidad se prepara para empezar este mes la vacunación antigripal | El Adelantado de Segovia Inicio Segovia Sanidad se prepara para empezar este mes la vacunación antigripal Sanidad se prepara para empezar este mes la vacunación antigripal La próxima campaña contra la gripe y el programa de detección precoz de enfermedades congénitas han sido algunos de los asuntos más relevantes abordados en el Consejo de Salud de Área Reunión del Consejo de Salud de Área de Segovia celebrada en la Delegación Territorial de la Junta. /E. A. El Servicio Territorial de Sanidad ultima los preparativos para iniciar la campaña de vacunación antigripal este mes, en torno al 20 de octubre como en años anteriores. César Montarelo, como jefe del Servicio de Sanidad, ha informado de la campaña autonómica de vacunación contra la gripe en la reunión del Consejo de Salud de Área de Segovia celebrada ayer, bajo la presidencia del delegado territorial, Javier López-Escobar, y con la asistencia del gerente de Asistencia Sanitaria, José Manuel Vicente; el presidente del Colegio Oficial de Médicos de Segovia, Enrique Guilabert; y representantes de sindicatos, organizaciones de empresarios y consumidores. Sanidad recuerda que la vacunación constituye una de las más eficaces medidas preventivas y de protección de la salud. Y, por ello, la Junta de Castilla y León invierte en esta campaña más de 3.156.400 euros en garantizar el acceso universal y gratuito a la inmunización frente a la gripe para toda la población de la Comunidad comprendida entre seis meses y 64 años. La vacunación está especialmente recomendada para las personas mayores de 60 años o para aquellas que, aun siendo menores de esa edad, tengan un elevado riesgo de padecer complicaciones derivadas de la gripe. También es aconsejable que se vacunen aquellos que pueden transmitir la gripe a los ciudadanos de los dos grupos anteriores. La gripe afecta a entre un 5% y un 15 % de la población española y es responsable de un elevado número de complicaciones en pacientes con patologías previas graves que, en muchos casos, suponen la hospitalización de los mismos. "Vacunarse frente a la gripe proporciona protección individualmente, e incrementa la protección social frente a una enfermedad contagiosa al reducir la incidencia de la misma y con ello, la circulación del virus", señala la Delegación Territorial de la Junta. El jefe del Servicio de Sanidad ha señalado que durante el invierno pasado hubo 1.149 casos declarados de gripe en Castilla y León, 1.049 se dieron en personas no vacunadas y 109 entre vacunados. También ha recordado que en el último curso, se vacunaron en la provincia 32.631 personas, 339 más que en la campaña anterior, y se registró una tasa de cobertura de 21,01% entre la población a la que va destinada la campaña. Por grupos de edad, se vacunaron en la provincia 8.267 personas menores de 60 años; 2.702 entre 60 y 64 años, lo que supone una tasa d

– Emi Makabe: Cuando estaba en la escuela secundaria, mi maestra de koto y shamisen pertenecía a una organización tradicional llamada Ikuta-ryu. Es típico en Japón aprender instrumentos tradicionales en cursos que son impartidos por organizaciones como éstas. Luego, más recientemente, me interesó explorar los sonidos del shamisen en mi música. Respeto, no obstante, mucho la tradición y ahora tengo un maestro de shamisen para profundizar en la forma tradicional de tocarlo ¡El shamisen es mi instrumento japonés favorito, sin duda! – Emi Makabe: Es una canción para mi compañero, Thomas. Como digo en la letra, se siente como si estuviera siempre lejos… ya que estamos separados casi la mitad del año. Simplemente me dejé llevar por los sentimientos.

08/04/2014, 17:12 PM #1 Hola, la pasada semana, un individuo agregó al skype a dos bancadores de un pack de torneos que jugábamos para el parqué. Se hizo pasar por mí, utilizando una cuenta con nick punki.to, poniéndose de foto mi avatar y diciendo que era punkitopoker de poker-red. Contactó con davidpeters y javitxu6. El último se salvó porque entre que leyó el mensaje, yo ya me puse en contacto con él y no se percató hasta que saltó la alarma, de que el primer chico que le habló fuue él y no yo. Por desgracia, davidpeters cayó en la trampa y le envió dinero a una cuenta de skrill que el estafador le facilitó. Habíamos abierto un hilo denunciando el tema, pero se mando borrar porque JAvitxu c

pt archivos - Centros Educativos Vicencianos de las Hijas de la Caridad España Sur - Mevisur Durante este curso, en nuestra Aula de Apoyo a la Integración, nos hemos propuesto dar protagonismo al movimiento y volver a los orígenes del aprendizaje. Dada la importancia del desarrollo evolutivo de los bebés en la inteligencia y en el progreso académico, quizás haya que analizar qué aprendizajes quedaron sin asentar en nuestra primera infancia y qué reflejos primitivos pudieran haber quedado sin integrar. Nuestros objetivos fundamentales son ejercitar la lateralidad, la coordinación, el equilibrio e integrar los reflejos a través de una Terapia de Movimientos Rítmicos: BRMT. Porque las dificultades en las habilidades académicas (lectura, escritura, cálculo, plástica, memorización…) están relacionadas con:​ La no-integración de los reflejos primitivos.​ Trabajar las diferentes etapas del desarrollo comprobando que cada etapa ha sido superada y se han ido logrando los prerrequisitos para un buen aprendizaje académico. Las dificultades en visión y audición.​ La mayor parte de la información que se recibe a nivel académico entra por el canal visual. He aquí la importancia de revisar si existen dificultades no sólo en la vista del alumno/a sino también en su visión. Del mismo modo, la audición también influye, no sólo en la comprensión verbal sino también en su lenguaje, en su capacidad atencional, y en las relaciones sociales principalmente. En caso de dificultades, informar a las familias con el fin de paliarlas y poder acced

Indra conquista Costa Rica con su tecnología de radares La compañía tecnológica Indra acaba de ganar el contrato de modernización de la gestión del tráfico aéreo de Costa Rica, que incluye los sistemas de torre de control de los tres aeropuertos de aquel país. En total, el contrato está valorado en 12 millones y permitirá a la empresa española reforzar la ya sólida relación que disfruta como proveedor tecnológico de la Corporación Centroamericana de Servicios de Navegación Aérea (Cocesna). De hecho, Indra gestiona en la actualidad todo el espacio aéreo superior de Centroamérica además de ser uno de los proveedores principales de sistemas de radar en todo el mundo, con tecnología implantada en más de 4.000 instalaciones de 160 países distintos. Gracias a este contrato costarricense al que ha tenido acceso elEconomista, Indra renovará las instalaciones y tecnologías responsables del control aéreo de los aeropuertos internacionales de Juan Santamaría, el principal del país y que brinda servicio a la ciudad de San José. También hará lo propio en los recintos aeroportuarios de Daniel Oduber Quirós, en Liberia; y el de Tobías Bolaños Palma. En el caso del centro de coordinación del tráfico aéreo de San José, según detalla Indra, las mejoras acordadas incorporarán "avanzados sistemas de comunicación de voz Garex 300, que forman parte de la familia de sistemas de comunicación IP de Indra, así como grabadores de voz Neptuno". A grandes rasgos, la tecnología Made in Spain ayudará al país centroamericano a aumentar el volumen del tráfico aéreo gracias a unos radares capaces de incrementar la capacidad de detección e identificación de aeronaves. De la mano de Indra, Costa Rica será el primer país del mundo que dispondrá de la tecnología que incorpora el denominado 'Protocolo NAM Nivel 3', considerado "el más avanzado para facilitar la coordinación entre centros de control a la hora de transferir la responsabilidad de la gestión del vuelo de un centro de control a otro". Según datos de la empresa, los radares primarios de Vigilancia de Indra fueron los más vendidos fuera de EEUU. Al mismo tiempo, los radares secundarios 'Modo S', q

Si eres un fanático de las películas de terror, ya sabes lo intensa que puede ser la experiencia de este tipo de películas. Hay algunas películas de terror que combinan el humor con la historia como una forma de dejar que la audiencia recupere el aliento. Otras “películas de miedo” mantienen el factor susto a lo largo de la película. Las películas que te gustan dependen de tus gustos personales, pero aquí hay una lista de las 10 mejores películas de terror de todos los tiempos sin ningún orden en particular. Estos son eventos de pantalla grande que todo aficionado al terror debería ver al menos una vez. 1. La mancha ¿Quién puede olvidar esta genial película que data de la década de 1950? Esta película de terror protagonizada por Steve McQueen como un joven rudo con un corazón de oro que luchó contra la feroz gota de sustancia pegajosa del espacio exterior que estaba devorando a todos a su paso. La nueva versión de este clásico de terror no fue tan buena como la versión original, que se convirtió en un elemento básico durante varios años. Esta fue una película que se creó cuando la gente estaba menos hastiada y, aunque los efectos especiales son ridículos según los estándares actuales, en el momento en que se estrenó esta película, la audiencia dejó que Pelis24 su imaginación les proporcionara las mejores escenas. 2. Mandíbulas Esta producción de Steven Spielberg sigue siendo uno de los grandes del cine y definitivamente merece estar en la lista de las 10 mejores películas de terror de todos los tiempos. A quién le importa si nadie realmente pudo ver una gran cantidad del tiburón demonio merodeador, esta fue otra película de pantalla grande que atendió a miedos imaginarios y sorprendió al público de todo el mundo con una carnicería en pantalla sorprendentemente pequeña. 3. Viernes 13 Esta película de terror moderna todavía atrae a los espectadores y atrae a nuevos fanáticos. Aunque se ha producido una serie completa de películas de Viernes 13, sigue siendo la original la que la gente recuerda mejor. Jason y esa máscara de hockey están grabados de forma indeleble en la mente de todos los que han visto este thriller “espeluznante”. 4. Casa en la Colina Embrujada Es otra película temprana que aún logró aferrarse a esos miedos a lo desconocido y conmocionar a millones de fanáticos desesperados. Esta fue una película que se especializó en crear escenas de terror que eran más emocionales que visuales. 5. El exorcista Durante los años 70 pocas películas atrajeron la ferviente publicidad que tuvo ésta. Cuando se estrenó por primera vez, la gente hacía filas extraordinariamente largas para tener la oportunidad de ser parte de la audiencia. Linda Blair saltó al estrellato como la joven poseída por un demonio y esa escena que muestra su cabeza dando vueltas como un trompo todavía puede causar escalofríos a cualquiera que alquile esta película. El hecho de que varias personas asociadas con esta película de terror resultaran heridas o muertas llevó incluso a conjeturar que había una maldición “Exorcista”. Por supuesto, este tipo de chismes solo hizo que la película fuera más popular entre los millones de fanáticos del terror en todo el mundo. La Igles

Menús de Cow CRM - Recoletos Pontevedra Inicio Menús de Cow CRM Menús de Cow CRM Cow CRM es la herramienta ideal para que pymes, microempresas y autónomos desarrollen la gestión comercial valiéndose del CRM más adecuado del mercado para ese perfil de empresas, con prestaciones propias de las grandes empresas y a un precio totalmente low cost. Para que se pueda tener una idea completa de lo que aporta, se muestra a continuación el contenido de los menús de los que está dotado Cow CRM y un pequeño resumen de cada uno de ellos. El siguiente es el menú que utiliza Cow CRM para gestionar las peticiones a través del flujo de trabajo: Todas las empresas anotan de una u otra forma las visitas comerciales, reportan información de lo que acontece en ellas, pasan pedidos o cursan emails. Generalmente suelen realizarse de forma individualizada, sin compartir con el resto de la empresa y utilizando herramientas desconectadas, como Excel. Otros procesos como llamadas telefónicas o simples tareas requieren, en la mayoría de los casos, bastante imaginación y herramientas que van desde el uso de papelitos tipo post-it, a innumerables correos electrónicos con instrucciones y reportes de información que no permite hacer un seguimiento sencillo. La información está, por supuesto, pero ¿dónde está y cómo está organizada? El tiempo de recopilación y búsqueda de toda esa información ya compensa la utilización de una herramienta como Cow CRM. El siguiente es el menú que utiliza Cow CRM para gestionar las cuentas y contactos: El cliente, el centro de la gestión de la empresa, alrededor del cual todo gira. Y a los clientes los hemos denominado Cuentas. El concepto de cuenta es un concepto más amplio que el concepto de cliente ya que entendemos por cuenta a cualquier persona física o jurídica que interactúa con nuestra empresa. Cuentas son Clientes, por supuesto, pero también proveedores, prospectos, suministradores o trabajadores. Además, a cada cuenta podemos asociarle infinitos contactos. Y toda la información la tenemos a golpe de click en la 'Ficha de cuenta'. La ficha dispone de un menú mediante el cual se puede acceder a información específica, clasificada y ordenada sobre aspectos de la cuenta: Contactos, Procesos, Peticiones… El siguiente es el menú que utiliza Cow CRM para llevar a cabo la gestión documental: Si pudiera reducir todo el papeleo de la empresa a lo estrictamente necesario Toda la documentación a un clic de distancia. Con los documentos guardados en la base de datos, podemos reducir el papeleo en la empresa a aquellos do

Danzando, que es gerundio: Que expresamos y que no queremos expresar. El cuerpo es un instrumento expresivo que informa constantemente sobre nuestro estado de ánimo, pensamientos, emociones,... todo esto lo percibe la gente que nos rodea, pudiendo dar una imagen o impresión buena o menos buena. Haciendo de esto un aspecto muy importante ya que va a condicionar muchas situaciones durante la vida. Como ya sabemos le ley exige una serie de contenidos que se deben impartir en secundaria, que desgraciadamente no se imparten de una manera suficientemente correcta en todos los centros, desde la docencia hay que conseguir que el alumno comprenda el valor que tiene el lenguaje no verbal y la expresión corporal, pero me voy a central en la importancia de la desinhibición ya que debe de ser una de las principales funciones educativas dentro de este contenido. Ya no solo nos referimos a la desinhibición desde la asignatura de educación física donde sean capa

El Tribunal de Justicia de la Unión Europea cierra la puerta a que los países europeos deban entregar visados humanitarios de forma obligatoria. Los jueces han dictaminado que los Estados miembros "no están obligados, en virtud del Derecho de la Unión, a expedir un visado humanitario a las personas que deseen entrar en su territorio con la intención de pedir asilo, pero son libres de hacerlo sobre la base de su Derecho nacional". Más información El abogado de la UE ve obligatorio dar visado humanitario si hay riesgo de tortura El abogado que evoca a Aylan para recordar sus valores a Europa La sentencia ahuyenta los temores de un amplio número de Estados europeos. Representantes de 13 de ellos, entre los que se contaban Francia y Alemania, intervinieron en una audiencia ante los tribunales para defender su derecho a negar la entrada para pedir asilo incluso a personas en riesgo de sufrir torturas o amenazas en sus países de origen. Entre los argumentos, esgrimían su incapacidad de acoger a todas las personas en esta situación y que sus consulados y embajadas, donde se tramitarían las demandas, podrían sufrir un alud de peticiones para el que no están preparadas. Todo empezó con la denuncia de una familia siria a la que el Gobierno belga negó el visado humanitario. El matrimonio y sus tres hijos, originarios de Alepo, solicitaron los documentos en la embajada belga de Líbano. Alegaron que temían sufrir persecución religiosa por su condición de cristianos y que sus vidas corrían peligro después de que, según su versión, uno de sus miembros fuera secuestrado, golpeado y liberado tras el pago de un rescate. Las autoridades de extranjería belgas le negaron repetidamente su entrada al país argumentando que la intención de la familia era quedarse más allá de los 90 días a los que le daría derecho el visado, por lo que recurrieron a los tribunales europeos. La decisión de la justicia comunitaria no impide que puedan expedirse visados humanitarios, pero otorga a cada Estado la facultad de elegir si lo hacen o no siguiendo sus propios criterios, lo que facilita la negativa. También lleva la contraria al abogado general Paolo Mengozzi, que hace exa

En el Foro de las Principales Economías sobre Energía y Clima, el presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador garantizó que, al final de su sexenio, 35% de las energías generadas en el país provendrán de fuentes renovables, así como se reducirán en 98% las emisiones de gas metano en procesos de producción de PEMEX. El presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador participó en el en el que dio a conocer las diez acciones que lleva a cabo el Gobierno de México para hacer frente al cambio climático. A través de videoconferencia en Palacio Nacional, el mandatario se refirió a la modernización de 16 plantas hidroeléctricas a través de la renovación de turbinas a fin de incrementar la producción de energía limpia en 2 mil 85 gigawatts hora anuales. Otra de las acciones es la inversión de Pemex hasta por 2 mil millones de dólares de recursos propios y de créditos internacionales a tasas especiales en reducir hasta en 98 por ciento las emisiones de gas metano en procesos de exploración y producción en la industria petrolera. Ante el presidente de Estados Unidos, Joseph Biden; el enviado presidencial especial para el Clima, John Kerry y líderes de 17 países, el jefe del Ejecutivo expuso que está por iniciar en Puerto Peñasco, Sonora, la instalación de un parque solar fotovoltaico con capacidad de generar mil megawatts. Hace 15 días, el Gobierno de la Cuarta Transformación celebró diálogos y compromisos con 17 empresas estadounidenses del sector energético para garantizar inversiones destinadas a generar mil 854 megawatts de energía solar y eólica. El mandatario destacó los avances en el propósito de alcanzar la autosuficiencia en la producción de combustibles como gasolinas, diésel y turbosina. En 2019 inició la modernización de seis refinerías, se adquirió la de Deer Park en Texas y el 2 de julio será inaugurada la de Dos Bocas en Paraíso, Tabasco. En México tiene lugar el programa de reforestación más importante del mundo: Sembrando Vida. A través de esta iniciativa 420 mil campesinos que reciben un apoyo salarial permanente cultivan un millón de árboles frutales y maderables. La inversión anual en esta iniciativa es de mil 500 millones de dólares de presupuesto público y representa la absorción de 4 millones de toneladas de dióxido de carbono. “Sostenemos el compromiso de producir en 2024, cuando menos, el 35 por ciento de toda la energía que consumimos en el país de fuentes limpias y renovables”, apuntó el mandatario como décimo punto del decálogo. El presidente Joseph Biden agradeció al presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador el trabajo conjunto y aseguró que Estados Unidos y México seguirán colaborando en enfrentar el cambio climático.

Tratamientos relajantes que van más allá del masaje tradicional Terapias con lodo volcánico y un flotario con sales epsom están entre las opciones. Pese a que los masajes son uno de los métodos de relajación más efectivos y con mayor consumo en los spas y centros especializados en salud y bienestar del cuerpo, este no es el único tratamiento de este tipo que puede probar. Existen terapias para desestresarse que van más allá de los masajes y que tienen beneficios emocionales, mentales y físicos. Las diferencias más significativas radican en detalles como el escenario, el tiempo de duración, los instrumentos de trabajo de los especialistas e incluso la hora en la que se realice el procedimiento. Por ejemplo, existen tratamientos que pueden durar toda una jornada o que cuentan con elementos como barro volcánico o termal, aromatizantes especiales o cuentan con instalaciones que crean un confort ideal para el cliente. Otras de las posibilidades que se pueden encontrar son propuestas en las que además del bienestar físico de la persona se trabaja la relajación mental. Una de ellas es el reiki, que según Sandra Niño, gerente del JW Marriott Spa, "es bastante popular en algunas regiones del mundo, pero no es tan fácil de encontrar los lugares ni las personas que ofrezcan el tratamiento en Colombia, pues es más enfocado al tema espiritual y al bienestar del cuerpo en general, y necesita más de una terapia para ver resultados". Otra de las opciones que se pueden encontrar son los circuitos hídricos que ofrecen lugares como el Ar Spa – Radisson AR Hotel Bogotá Aeropuerto, recientemente nominado a los World Luxury Spa Awards (Premios Mundiales a los Spas de Lujo) y que apuesta por los beneficios que aporta la corriente del agua. Según su coordinadora, Susana Pérez Juliao, "somos los únicos en la zona que tenemos ese tipo de tratamiento y de infraestructura, en la cual el cliente puede encontrar todas las comodidades para relajarse". Algunos de los beneficios que ofrecen Además de mejorar la circulación, estos tratamientos ti

Conservadores se van con Vargas Lleras – El Artículo El candidato Germán Vargas Lleras sumó el respaldo del Partido Conservador, luego de la votación de la junta de parlamentarios que decidió entre respaldarlo a él o al candidato uribista Iván Duque. Finalmente, con una mayoría de 32 votos contra 21, los congresistas azules se inclinaron por un acuerdo programático con la campaña Mejor Vargas Lleras. Tras la decisión, el exvicepresidente queda ahora con el apoyo, al menos oficial, de los conservadores y el Partido de La U. Sin embargo, congresistas del partido explicaron que la decisión tiene peso netamente político lo cual significa que no será de obligatorio cumplimiento para los militantes, que podrán apoyar otras aspiraciones. A través de un sistema de voto en urna, los integrantes de la junta parlamentaria (actuales congresistas y aquellos que resultaron electos el pasado 11 de marzo), manifestaron sus posiciones sobre las dos opciones que tenían sobre la mesa. La balanza se inclinó hacia Vargas Lleras, según algunos legisladores consultados por BLU Radio, luego de la negativa de Iván Duque para sostener una reunión con la bancada. Algunos congresistas expresaron su descontento y defendieron la opción de Vargas, quien en repetidas oportunidades envió mensajes pidiendo el apoyo de los conservadores e incluso abrió la puerta a elegir como fórmula vicepresidencial a alguien que representara las banderas d

La víctima de femicidio en zona oeste había contado que sufría violencia Un nuevo femicidio y otra muerte que causa mucho dolor. Marcelina Peloc de 44 años fue apuñalada el fin de semana en el barrio Gustavo Leguizamón, en la zona oeste. Su agresor sería su ex pareja, quien habría dado el aviso a la Policía y posteriormente se dio a la fuga. Mientras su familia espera el resultado de la autopsia y recibir su cuerpo para su sepelio, en el barrio sus vecinos no salen de la conmoción. "Me dejó fría la noticia", dijo a Somos Salta su vecina y amiga, Daniela. Habló el hijo de la mujer asesinada: "Quiero que lo atrapen y que pague" La mujer contó que Marcelina se había separado hace aproximadamente dos años del padre de sus 4 hijos. "Trabajaba conmigo en casa de familia, una mujer muy luchadora, lo siento mucho sobre todo por los chicos. Ha sido una excelente persona y vecina. Y excelente madre también", expresó. A su vez recordó que ella le había contado que sufría violencia y ello la habría llevado a terminar con la relación con Melanio González, el presunto asesino que es buscado intensamente por la Policía de Salta.

ORRORESMEDICOS: PRESERVAR LA MEMORIA Una casa de Sant Sadurni esconde el legado de 300 años de una estirpe médica El último miembro dedicado a la profesión lucha en solitario para preservar ese tesoro Ramon Viader Guixà conserva en su casa de Sant Sadurní d'Anoia el legado de sus antepasados médicos y farmacéuticos. La casa del farmacéutico jubilado Ramon Viader Guixà, en Sant Sadurní d'Anoia, esconde un tesoro médico. Se trata de más de mil piezas –frascos, fármacos, máquinas, libros…– que testimonian los tres siglos a lo largo de los cuales las 10 generaciones anteriores a la de Viader Guixà se dedicaron a la medicina y la farmacia. El último de la estirpe trabaja a toda velocidad y con dinero exclusivamente de su bolsillo para preservar el legado. Su último esfuerzo es el libro 'Viader. Nissaga de metges i apotecaris' (Rubes Editorial, 2017). "No tengo nadie atrás: tengo un hijo ingeniero agrónomo y otro piloto de aviones", se sincera Viader Guixà. Esas piezas forman parte de su vida. "Mis padres las tenían en casa. Yo nací prácticamente en la farmacia, que era parte de la vivienda. Cuando se vendió, me quedé yo con todo", afirma. Una de las piezas más valiosas es un frasco florentino, un concentrador de esencias de vidrio, de principios del siglo XVIII. "El vidrio es raro, porque se rompe mucho", explica Viader Guixà. La colección contiene también un estuche de bolsillo de 1840, con una veintena de fármacos homeopáticos. Otra pieza curiosa es un pote de aspirina en polvo de 1898: por aquel entonces, Bayer aún no dominaba la técnica del comprimido. La biblioteca Viader guarda joyas como una impresión de 1663 de un libro del médico griego 'Dioscórides' y una copia de la primera farmacopea oficial en España, la Valentina. Un posible museo de la salud en L'Hospitalet aspira a hacerse con parte de la colección La colección Viader se expuso en el 2015 en en la Facultat de Farmàcia de la Universitat de Barcelona y ahora se prepara una vitrina definitiva en su sede. "Recientemente, he tenido contactos con el Ayuntamiento de L'Hospitalet, que quiere tirar adelante el Museu de Cièncias de la Salut de Catalunya, con la aspiración de que sea un referente en Europa", afirma Viader Guixà. L'Hospitalet aspira también a hospedar un instituto de medicina tradicional China. "Desconozco el proyecto del museo. Me parece muy bien, pero no se pueden hacer cosas ignorando lo que se lleva luc

Monumento al Bicentenario del Éxodo: profundo agradecimiento de los vecinos de Barrio 18 de Noviembre | Jujuy al día® Inicio Locales Monumento al Bicentenario del Éxodo: profundo agradecimiento de los vecinos de Barrio... Monumento al Bicentenario del Éxodo: profundo agradecimiento de los vecinos de Barrio 18 de Noviembre Jujuy al día® – El intendente "Chuli Jorge" recibió, en el Salón de los Intendentes, a vecinos del Barrio 18 de Noviembre quienes hicieron entrega de un reconocimiento en agradecimiento por el trabajo desplegado por el municipio en torno a la concreción del Monumento al Bicentenario del Éxodo Jujeño Al término del ameno encuentro, el intendente Jorge dijo: "la Municipalidad ha podido recomenzar obras que estaban enmarcadas en el Parque Monumento al Bicentenario del Éxodo Jujeño, que se había empezado a fines del 2012, con un proceso de participación comunitaria, tanto en el proyecto como en la definición del lugar, que fue determinante para poder desarrollar las obras que hoy están en construcción". A este concepto agregó, "gracias también a que el Gobierno Nacional reconoció lo que estaba ejecutado, ya que era muy importante para nuestra ciudad y nuestra provincia tener un parque conmemorativo del Éxodo Jujeño". Sobre las obras, el intendente explicò: "se está construyendo infraestructura muy importante para todo el sector y también para la comunidad del Barrio Santa Rosa, que también tiene proximidad con la Escuela, con el Mercado, ahí se está construyendo un anfiteatro importantísimo con oficinas complementarias que van a significar hacer más dinámico y llevar contenidos descentralizados para todos estos vecinos que forman una comunidad muy importante". A su turno, el Concejal Sánchez destacó la activa labor y participación conjunta del municipio y de los vecinos, acentuando la importancia de la descentralización, "el intendente es un vecino más, así lo reconocen los vecinos del barrio por toda esta preocupación del intendente de lograr el desarrollo, que se ha materializado en la construcción del monumento al Bicentenario del El Éxodo Jujeño, una situación que va a poner en valor a estos barrios, Kennedy, 18 de Noviembre, San Cayetano, Epam, Santa Ros". "Los vecinos han venido a reconocer todo esta fecunda labor que realiza el intendente y por la preocupación en buscar el bienestar de los vecinos; desde el Concejo Deliberante siempre vamos a acompañar las políticas diseñadas por el intendente en aras de trabajar al lado de los vecinos" finalizó el edil. En tanto Luis Muro, presidente del Centro Vecinal del Barrio 18 de Noviembre expresó un profundo agradecimiento de parte de la comunidad, "mi presencia acá es para agradecerle al Señ

Cajamarca: Laboratorio molecular cumple un año procesando más de 30 000 muestras de descarte de la COVID-19 Dependencia también logró identificar cuatro variantes del virus SARS-CoV-2, y realizó trabajos de investigación Fotos: Diresa Cajamarca 22 de setiembre de 2021 - 9:23 a. m. El Laboratorio de Biología Molecular del Gobierno Regional de Cajamarca cumplió este 21 de setiembre su primer año de funcionamiento teniendo como dos de sus logros el procesamiento de un total de 33 845 muestras de descarte de la COVID-19 e identificando cuatro variantes del virus SARS-CoV-2. El director de esta dependencia, Jorge Bazán Mayra, indicó que dicho laboratorio nació de la necesidad de facilitar el diagnóstico y poder confirmar o descartar la COVID-19 en la población cajamarquina. Asimismo, señaló que antes existía dificultad para procesar las muestras, por lo que se enviaban al Instituto Nacional de Salud (INS) o al Laboratorio Molecular de Jaén. Actualmente, se tiene la capacidad de procesar 20 000 muestras al mes. "También como parte de nuestro trabajo, que hemos ido especializando cada vez más, hemos identificado la circulación de cuatro variantes del coronavirus a nivel regional, tales como la Lambda, De

Detienen a preso fugado que violó a tres niños y mató a uno de ellos | Noticias al instante desde LAVOZ.com.ar | La Voz Detienen a preso fugado que violó a tres niños y mató a uno de ellos 16 de julio de 2011, 18:54 • Sucesos > Abuso sexual FERNÁNDEZ. El abusador fue capturado (Foto: www.mdzol.com). Pedro Fernández (60) había sido condenado a prisión perpetua. Pero el domingo pasado, cuando, salió del penal, no regresó. Ahora lo apresaron. El preso que había fugado el domingo pasado de una cárcel de Mendoza donde cumplía una condena por violación de menores, a uno de los cuales había asesinado porque lo conocía, fue recapturado hoy, informaron fuentes judiciales. Se trata de Pedro Américo Fernández, de 60 años, quien en 1991 había intentado violar a dos chicos y había abusado sexualmente de otros tres, a uno de los cuales asesinó "porque lo conocía y podía denunciarlo", informaron voceros de la Justicia local. Fernández fue apresado ese año y, tras ser identificado por la víctimas, en las rondas de reconocimiento, fue condenado por la Justicia provincial a prisión perpetua. En 1999, en ocasión de las Fiestas de Fin de Año cuando se rebajan o conmutan penas, el gobierno provincial dispuso rebajarle la condena a 25 años de reclusión, por "buen comportamiento en la penitenciaria en los últimos ocho años" según aconsejaron jueces de ejecución penal de la época. Este año, cuando se cumplían dos décadas de la condena que termina en 2016, Fernández reclamó y obtuvo "por buena conducta" el beneficio de salidas por horas, durante los fines de semana, "para visitar un familiar", que otorgó otro juez de ejecución penal. Desde el domingo pasado, cuando salió del penal y no regresó, Fernández pasó a ser el hombre mas buscado de Mendoza y fue recapturado hoy tras el allanamiento de una vivienda de la ciudad de Rivadavia, al este de la capital provincial. En su histotial figura que el acusado "se hacía pasar como técnico de fútbol, que promocionaba a chicos para que jugaran en clubes de Junín, Rivadavia y San Martín". En 1991 se comprobó que Fernández había intentado violar a dos chicos de la zona y había abusado de otros tr

AnteriorPublicación anterior:Barrios en Londres, quedó cerca de dar la marca a TokioSiguientePublicación siguiente:Daniela Campuzano cerró en el lugar 27 en Cross Country de la Copa del Mundo de Ciclismo de Montaña Cruz Azul, Toluca, Puebla, Dorados, son algunos equipos que al igual que el América se han encontrado en medio de una polémica por supuestas alineaciones indebidas. En la mayoría de los casos los clubes han salido airosos, pero sí se han registrado sanciones. En el caso del América, se juzga al árbitro, según lo publicado por la Comisión Disciplinaria, y las Águilas podrían salir con los tres puntos que ganaron en el juego contra el Atlas. Cruz Azul perdió una semifinal contra Pachuca en el Clausura 2007, debido a que alinearon a Salvador Carmona, jugador que estaba suspendido de por vida por doping. Decio de María, entonces secretario General de la Federación Mexicana de Futbol, informó la decisión. Toluca reclamó una alineación indebida del Cruz Azul, debido a que La Máquina Celeste registró al mediocampista Alan Vidal, pero en la banca estuvo Jesús Lara. Los escarlatas perdieron el compromiso en la cancha y reclamaron por la vía administrativa, pero la Comisión Disciplinaria resolvió que no había “elemento alguno para determinar alineación indebida”. Dorados de Sinaloa perdió un parido contra Leones Negros, de Copa Mx, porque se presentó a jugar con sólo 11 jugadores con participación en el primer equipo y no con 12, como estipulaba el reglamento de competencia. El equipo de Culiacán fue sancionado con una derrota y una multa de mil UMAS. El mediocampista Gerson Torres estuvo a punto de debutar con el América, en un juego contra Pumas en el Clausura 2017, pero de último momento salió de la alineación. Todo debido a que la Liga MX le informó a los de Coapa que el Tico no podía participar, debido a que fue registrado en la Sub 20 y de hacerlo las Águilas incurrirían en una alineación indebida. En el 2020, el Tico comentó en una entrevista que no triunfó con los Azulcremas, entre otras cosas, por ese incidente. En el Apertura 2018, Cruz Azul Femenil fue señalado por registrar a Mercedes Rodríguez como asistente técnica, en la última jornada del campeonato y pese a que ya había tenido actividad con otro club. La comisión disciplinaria decidió que la Máquina Celeste perdía el partido y le entregó la victoria a Pumas, resultado co

Las dos caras Chilenas | Pobreza en Chile; Problema de todos Pobreza en Chile; Problema de todos Pobreza, concepto Posted in Uncategorized on 26 octubre, 2008 by ceja08 En este mapa podemos observar un pequeño acercamiento al concepto de pobreza, que nos servirá para comprender nuestro blog. Parodia Pobreza, 'Chile Desigual'. Posted in Uncategorized on 25 octubre, 2008 by ceja08 Parodia realizada, a manera de identificar, de esta forma las diferencias entre estas dos clases sociales. Ensayo: "Chile Desigual" Siempre nos ha llamado la atención la desigualdad en Chile. ¿Sabemos todos que nuestra distribución es escandalósamente escandalosa (valga la rebundancia)? ¿Estamos conscientes de los reales niveles de desigualdad que posee nuestro querido país? Revisemos algunos pequeños datos. El índice más aceptado a nivel mundial para medir dicho problema, es el coeficiente de Gini. Este es un factor que se sitúa entre el 0 y el 1, siendo 1 un país la distribución concentrada en un sólo individuo, y 0, un país con distribucion perfectamente homogénea. Chile posee un Gini de 0.5649, solo comparable con algunas tristes realidades como Nigeria y Bangladesh. Para contextualizar un poco, África al sur del Sahara tiene Gini 0.4695, América Latina y Caribe 0.4931, Asia Oriental y el Pacífico 0.3809, Asia del Sur 0.3188, Europa del Este 0.2894, Medio Oriente y África del Norte 0.3803, los países industrializados o en vías de desarrollo con altos ingresos 0.3375 . Vale decir, una de las peores distribuciones del mundo. Las causas de la desigualdad en Chile han sido estudiadas extensamente por distintos individuos. En el CEP (Centro de Estudios Públicos), se han realizado incontables estudios al respecto, atribuyendo la desigualdad de nuestro país a la falta de acumulación de capital humano y físico, la mala distribución inicial de las riquezas, los retornos de la educación, la sobre dependencia a los recursos naturales, etc. Sin embargo, llama much

Propuestas de photo call, de candy bar, seating plan o algunas de nuestras creaciones hand made, además de unos elegantes centros de mesa para día y para noche fueron algunas de las creaciones que La Lola trasladó hasta Finca Los Rosales para mostrar a las parejas parte de su trabajo.

LPG® rehabilita tu belleza Publicado en21/02/2017 3307 Aunque se lleve un estilo de vida sano, con frecuencia las células grasas acaban almacenando más de lo que eliminan, y es por ello que aparece la piel de naranja. Estas zonas grasas, poco estéticas y a veces dolorosas, no desaparecen ni con ejercicio físico ni con dieta. Con el tiempo, las células jóvenes se ralentizan, igual que la producción de colágeno y elastina, lo que provoca una relajación cutánea. Para solucionarlo contamos con nuestro LPG CELLU M6 INTEGRAL, que nos permite quemar las grasas localizadas resistentes, remodelar las formas del cuerpo y reactivar los procesos naturales de adelgazamiento y antienvejecimiento. LPG® es una marca líder a nivel mundial, y su decálogo de marca nos demuestra porque lo es: Una belleza responsable: 100% natural, no invasivo y seguro. No es un simple eslogan, es su razón de ser. LPG® no es competencia de ningún equipo del mercado, porque su técnica natural y patentada es única en el mundo. Ninguna persona sin la formación oficial debería utilizar el equipo. Hacen falta dos días para aprender a tratar con la tecnología LPG®. Y los consumibles oficiales de la marca son los únicos que ofrecen garantía de segurar y de resultados. LPG® no vende milagros, su Mécano-Stimulation activa la acción natural del cuerpo; reactiva en profundidad la actividad celular adormecida. Por lo tanto, hacen falta algunas sesiones para poder ver los grandes resultados. Aunque si es verdad que, desde la primera sesión, se pueden notar los efectos sobre la salud y el bienestar. Al ser una estimulación natural de la piel, las contraindicaciones que tiene son mínimas; pero es importante tenerlas en cuenta. LPG® está indicado tanto para hombres como para mujeres y tiene una tecnología específica para rostro y otra para el cuerpo. LPG® no es doloroso, todo lo contrario, debe ser un tratamiento agradable. Si es doloroso podríamos estar dañando el tejido, provocando reacciones no deseadas y puede ser que el diagnóstico no se haya realizado correctamente o el tratamiento no se esté aplicando de manera adecuada. Se puede hacer LPG® durante el embarazo en las pierna

No hemos ganado nada: Miguel Herrera - Regio Deporte Inicio » Fútbol » No hemos ganado nada: Miguel Herrera Tagged: Cruz Azul, Miguel Herrera, Tigres de la UANL Monterrey, Nuevo León. La buena racha de triunfos en Tigres no es algo que tenga satisfecho a Miguel Herrera, quien dejó en claro que aún no han ganado nada. El entrenador felino aseguró que no se darán por "bien servidos" hasta que levanten algo en este semestre, frente al Cruz Azul de quienes no se van a confiar, pues consideró que no será un juego de "alto riesgo". "No hemos ganado nada, solo partidos y son 3 puntos, mientras el equipo no haya levantado nada en este semestre no podemos bajar los brazos como por servidos, al contrario, la exigencia es ganar cada jornada y en ese tenor tenemos que trabajar y el público venga feliz al estadio, nuestra obligación es hacer un buen desenvolvimiento en la cancha. "Están peleando en la parte de arriba como nosotros, lo importante es sumar puntos y vamos con todo, con esa idea. Son dos equipos que suelen atacar bien, vamos a tratar de buscar el arco rival pero Cruz Azul lo ha mostrado, que tiene esa fortaleza de llegar con gente al área rival, que sea un partido atractivo para nuestra tribuna. Son buenos planteles que vienen haciendo buen torneo, son partidos importantes, tanto riesgo no tengo ese calificativo, todos son importantes y hasta que no los juegan dejan de ser importantes hasta que no los jugamos", confesó. Por último, el famoso 'Piojo' expresó su inconformidad con las protestas hacia Javier Agirre, quien finalmente tuvo que dar un paso al costado en el banquillo de Rayados, deseándole buena suerte a él y a su inminente reemplazo, Víctor Manuel Vucetich. "La verdad es que sí estoy en desacuerdo con la reacción de la gente, nuestra chamba es así, somos un gremio de entrenadores y el público viene a checar tu chamba, si no les gusta te la critican o abuchean, de repente incomoda pero nuestro trabajo es así y lo entendemos, de seguro Javier si se fue dolido, pero es fuerte, preparado, sabrá asimilar eso y regresará mucho más fuerte, que te vaya mal en un club no quita la calidad de entrenador. Por otro lado llega un entrenador querido, Víctor les ha dado muchos éxitos y es otro cantar, hay técnicos que llegan generando dudas, otros con la bendición de poder entrar con el pie derecho y creo que Víctor lo ha hecho bien en Monterrey, así es nuestra chamba, nos toca entrar de relevo por alguien conocido que es amigo, pero el trabajo es así, reitero, Javier estará listo como lo está víctor ahorita, sale de chivas de una forma que me pa

"Abran las Puertas, Señores…" – Politicos al Desnudo "Abran las Puertas, Señores…" Este 2020 es el año eminentemente político. Para el mes de octubre o noviembre ya deberán de estar conformados los partidos que van a presentar candidatos a contender para alcaldes, diputados locales y federales, así como síndicos y regidores con vía a la elección electoral que se celebrará el 6 de junio del próximo 2021, justo a la mitad del sexenio del presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador y como dirían en mi pueblo, ahora vamos a saber de qué cuero salen más correas. Ahora vamos a saber si la ciudadanía está conforme con el trabajo realizado por el gobierno federal morenista a cargo de Andrés Manuel López Obrador y también del gobernador de Veracruz, Cuitláhuac García Jiménez, que no es por echarle fuego a la hoguera, pero ha venido haciendo un gobierno muy cuestionado con los señalamientos de que hace un gobierno de amiguismo, de compadrazgo y que tiene familiares, reconocidos o no, incrustados en el gobierno que encabeza, a parte de tener funcionarios que han sido señalados de ineptos y más de uno de dudosa procedencia, cierto o no, el electorado le puede pasar la factura, todo esto aunado a que el estado está tinto de sangre y Cuitláhuac García Jiménez, como diría el comercial de "Don Sebas", muy campante. El PRI, el otrora Partido aplanadora, con las derrotas sufridas en Tuxpan en la pasada elección, ya está buscando a sus mejores elementos para recuperar o tratar de recuperar la alcaldía, que por años fue de su feudo, alcaldía que tal parece estaba escriturada para el PRI, como para México estuvieron escriturados los veneros del petróleo, como lo escribiera el poeta López Velarde en su poema Suave Patria. El PRI, ya está presto a presentar sus mejores elementos para que puedan contender y con muchas posibilidades de triunfo; bueno, al menos eso suponen, aunque priistas locales rumoran algo que tiende a hacerse grande entre la ciudadanía, el tricolor local no tiene mucha tele de donde cortar. Como también no tienen mucha tela de donde cortar algunos de los partidos de costumbre y los nuevos que también hay que tomarlos en cuenta, pero esto será comentario aparte. Los neopriistas que están incrustados en su Comité Municipal ya están a la espera de los tiempos, ya se está

"Sintonía de amor" cumple 25 años | Sector Cine "Sintonía de amor" cumple 25 años Por: shuidobro Foto: Tristar Pictures 26. Jun. 2018 Si viviste los noventa y no amas ni odias a Meg Ryan, no estuviste ahí. "Sintonía de amor", un clásico de las dates en esa década, está cumpliendo 25 años. Aunque usted… no lo crea. Un día en el futuro alguien verá hacia atrás y pensará en los años noventa como ese tiempo en el que Kurt Cobain estaba vivo y la gente joven sabía quién era Meg Ryan. Aunque la generación millennial pueda tener apenas un recuerdo vago de la posterior y más bobalicona Tienes un e-mail (1998), la misma Nora Ephron, quien para entonces ya estaba convertida en la Woody Allen de los cursis, escribió cinco años antes otro guion que ya había reunido los suspiros sentimentales de Tom Hanks y Meg Ryan, cuya película reventó las taquillas recaudando algo así como el 1,100% de su presupuesto original. En las bodas de plata de Sintonía de amor (Sleepless In Seattle, 1993), te presentamos cinco datos que ni te imaginabas: 1.- El estelar era de Julia Roberts A pesar de que Nora Ephron y Meg Ryan ya se habían anotado un home run conjunto con Cuando Harry conoció a Sally (1989), el guion original fue ofrecido por la cineasta a Tom Hanks y a Julia Roberts, seguramente animada por el éxito de Mujer bonita (1990) y la posición de Roberts como novia de América (perdón, Lucerito). De hecho, tanto Hanks como Roberts declinaron, lo que llevó a Ephron a reescribir el libreto ayudada por su hermana. Hanks leyó la segunda versión y terminó por aceptar, aunque con nueva compañera: Ryan. 2.- Jason Schwartzman… ¿hijo de Tom Hanks? Para el papel del carismático y recién huérfano Jonah, el hijo pequeño de Tom Hanks en la cinta, los dos candidatos finales eran Ross Malinger, quien lo interpreta en la película… y un niño llamado Jason Schwartzman. 25 años después, Schwartzman es el a

Aguirre se presenta a la alcaldía de Madrid para mantener la impunidad del PP Su carismática personalidad hace que caiga en gracia, pero hay que ver mas allá de su caracter alegre 17/05/2015 16:59 17/05/2015 16:59 Esperanza, se presenta nuevamente alcaldesa Es ante todo una política con gran talento natural, la menos populista de todo el Partido Popular, pero también es la que más se aleja de la realidad, es la más inmune a la verdad. Se cree sus propias mentiras, es la profesional política que se cree ser la única honrada, no sólo de todo el partido sino de todo el universo. Es sin ninguna duda una señora con estrella y duende, ha sobrevivido a un accidente de helicóptero y a un atentado terrorista en Bombay donde murieron 125 personas. Ella sigue inmune, aunque bajo su mimo se criaron varios personajes de la Gürtel y la Púnica. Su inocencia en ese mundo político la llevó conformar listas con: Mario Zabía Lasala, Ignacio González, Granados, Juan José Güemes, Alberto López Viejo, Alfonso Bosch, Benjamín Martín Vasco, José María de Federico, Carlos Clemente Aguado, José Ignacio Fernández Rubio, Francisco Acedo y Jesús Gómez, y muchos , muchos más, todos imputados de uno u otro motivo, ya sea de la Púnica, la Gurtel, caso Nóminas o por cobro de comisiones, tráfico de influencias, blanqueo de capitales, falsedad documental, asociación ilícita y otro largo etc

Un blog de críticas de cualquier película, analizadas de una forma muy peculiar y dinámica, con cuatro pilares básicos (el entretenimiento, la emotividad, la originalidad y su final). Páginas Inicio Crítica de Películas Ranking AleuCine Crítica de Series Noticias Especiales Lista de Películas viernes, 24 de enero de 2014 Paranormal Movie “La formula de siempre ya no funciona” FICHA TÉCNICA Año: 20 de diciembre 2013 País: Estados Unidos Duración: 1horas 39minutos Género: Comedia Presupuesto: 2 millones de dólares Recaudación: 31 millones de dólares Título: Paranormal Movie → Lo mejor: -Simplemente Marlon Wayans, el único actor con una pizca de gracia. → Lo peor: -Un reparto insulso, y unos sketch muy vistos. En este blog tenemos la fiel costumbre de celebrar fechas significativas con críticas de películas que no valen un pimiento, la primera crítica del 2014 fue para Te quiero, tío y la primera crítica después del lavado de cara del blog será para Paranormal Movie. Desde ya comentar que si es lo que pensáis, una parodia más que bebe de los vientos de todas sus hermanas (Scary Movie, Date Movie, Disaster Movie, Superhero Movie, y toda la leche que le queráis poner un Movie al final), y si los sketches son muy similares a sus familiares, tenemos ante nosotros otra copia más. Muchas escenas carecerán de gracia porque simplemente son horrible (o se interpretan realmente mal, vaya películita se marca Essence Atkins), y otras simplemente están más recalentadas que la comida en una casa de estudiantes. Solo saldrá al rescate el único valor de la película, el protagonista masculino, salvando más de un skecth. El problema de ver una y otra vez escenas, con intención de ser graciosas, es que si no son realmente buenas te cansan. Es lo que pasa a nuestro film, tenemos ante nosotros escenas vistas ya en sus hermanas (todo ese cúmulo de parodias que acaban en Movie), por lo tanto no llegarán a sacarnos una sonrisa, además que hasta en la propia película se repetirán bromas, y si ya le sumamos un reparto (con excepción de Marlon) con unas actuaciones horribles, tenemos una película algo aburrida. Y eso que empezaba con buen pie, un ritmo realmente devastador, y con bastantes (no todas) bromas graciosas, pero se les acaba rápido la mecha y tendremos ante nosotros 45 minutos insufribles. Al final vuelve a coger algo de ritmo, pero la sensación general es de un quiero y no puedo, y de culo veo culo quiero. Otra parodio que pasará con más pena que gloria. Si la parte importante que es el entretenimiento no esta cubierto, como debe ser analizar el apartado emocional en una parodia. Bastante sencillo, evidentemente no buscan sacar partido de la parte emocional, y solo nos queda analizar los mensajes que incluyen. En ese aspecto, es bastante superficial pero la parte que tocan la verdad que tiene su gracia. El echo de tener un reparto mayoritariamente de color, le dará mucho juego a los mensajes racistas, y la trama de las parejas que se van a vivir juntos también tiene bastante juego, y punto final, no hay ningún mensaje más que nos quieran mostrar. Creo que es con diferencia, y eso en está película ya es mucho decir, la peor parte de toda la cinta. Después de aguantar el nudo como cada uno puede, empieza a coger ritmo, vuelves a reírte un poco y en vez de acabarla aquí, y dejarte con más o menos buen gusto, insisten en ofrecer 5 minutos más, que con diferencia serán lo peor de toda la película, sin gracia alguna, llegando a causarte vergüenza ajena. Un final a la altura de todo el film, para una película más, llena de despropósitos y que consigue lo que quería, ganar 31 millones invirtiendo solo 2 (con semejante bazofia es digno de admirar).

¿Qué es la realidad? : Offtopic general Asunto: ¿Qué es la realidad? Publicado: 06 Feb 2018, 17:28 Hola, me he encontrado este cortometraje. Si os apetece miradlo, creo que puede sorprender. Asunto: Re: ¿Qué es la realidad? Publicado: 06 Feb 2018, 17:56 1er postulado: la realidad es un constructo social 2do: la realidad es un delirio colectivo Publicado: 06 Feb 2018, 23:57 Publicado: 07 Feb 2018, 00:40 Publicado: 07 Feb 2018, 04:35 Publicado: 07 Feb 2018, 08:01 Va de menos a más, llegando a mucho, y termina en menos. El intro es un bodrio y el ending también (deberían aprender del anime), pero en general está bastante bueno. Y menos mal que decidí verlo en vez de guiarme por los comentarios porque no comentan ni la mitad de todo lo que se dice. Pero yo también paso de hacerlo, sólo digo que una de las cosas más básicas de la filosofía es la refutación de... lo que tenía entendido se llamaba"esceptisismo radical" o absoluto, pero bueno, parece que no es es eso, sino esto: https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorgias#T ... tiese,_sería_incognoscible Y del subjetivismo radical/absoluto. Tú sólo dices que puede sorprender, no opinas sobre si las afirmaciones del profe son ciertas o falsas. Ni siquiera una. Normal porque eres el OP, pero bue. Sócrates opina que está muy bueno, pero supongo que se refiere al video no a que las ideas del profe en él sean ciertas. Edu pone una imagen con la cual quizá cree que refuta las ideas que pone socrates pero se equivoca, ya que la idea de rojo podría ser un constructo social también. Se podría invertir el ejemplo, aunque no sé bien cómo... A un extraterrestre le enseñan qué es el rojo para nosotros, y en una ocasión cruza la calle con el semáforo con luz infraroja, pero nosotros la vemos roja. Un astronauta desmayado y su nave caen cerca de una tribu perdida. Los tribuales (wft), conocidos por el astronauta, lo llevan con su jefe, momento en el cual ya ha despertado. - ¡Esperad, no soy vuestro enemigo! - Es lo que vamos a averiguar. ¡Tiradlo en el pozo de cocodrilos! - Si sobrevive, es un peligro para nuestro Dios Coco, y sino, le ayudará. El astronauta usa sus propulsores para volar fuera del pozo. - ¡Es un peligro! ¡matadle! - El que grita "¡No estoy loco!" está loco, hazle el test. - Estás loco, en la playa no hay serpientes saliendo del mar. - ¡No estoy loco! ¡no dije serpientes, dije una! - ¡Al manicomio! Pero concuerdo con la idea: http://existentialcomics.com/comic/182 (tanto buscar comics de lo contrario sirvió para algo, aunque no lo que pensaba) Y Juan? Casi nada ha dicho. Acaso será un postmodernista? Publicado: 07 Feb 2018, 10:19 Quiero preguntar qué es el universo, que en mi opinión sería algo diferente a lo que se pregunta en este tema, pero si nos basamos en el título podría tomarse como lo mismo. ¿Qué me sugieres hacer? Se me acaba de ocurrir preguntar qué significa universo, o qué significado se le debería dar a dicha palabra. ¿Es diferente a tu tema? En otro Edu ha planteado que el universo son como fotogramas, y otro forero dice algo como "todo en el universo es movimiento", ante lo cual me preguntaba si el espacio también seria algo que se mueve, o si el espacio (supuestamente quieto, aunq

Afirma Corral que César D., ya se siente protegido y ha recuperado poder gobierno exmandatario noticias Parral - El Sol de Parral | Noticias Locales, Policiacas, sobre México, Chihuahua y el Mundo Afirma Corral que César D., ya se siente protegido y ha recuperado poder El Gobernador indicó que le llama la atención que se le dé importancia a un corrupto que solo busca engañar Como un acto desmedido de cinismo fue como el gobernador Javier Corral Jurado catalogó la misiva de César Horacio D.J. exmandatario de Chihuahua donde se asume como una víctima de la persecución de la administración Corralista. Se le está preparando el terreno para generarle un ambiente favorable para abrirle la puerta de la cárcel señaló Javier Corral, quien negó que se trate de un asunto político o personal, sino que cada acusación al exmandatario está sustentada en una investigación. El mandatario estatal afirma que César Horacio D.J. ya se siente protegido y que ha recuperado el poder, "no es más que un intento de engañar a los chihuahuenses, pero la sociedad chihuahuense no se chupa el dedo".

El hackeo a Ashley Madison descubre a 37 millones de adúlteros | Informe21.com Los hackers amenazan con publicar la información de los usuarios así como la de sus empleados. El ataque viene tras la publicación de que si los usuarios pagaban 19 dólares se haría un borrado completo de la información que de ellos había. Al no haberse realizado lo que prometían, el grupo ha decidido actuar. Del mismo modo, los hackers han asegurado que "vamos a liberar a todos los registros de clientes, incluyendo los perfiles con fantasías sexuales secretas de todos los clientes a los que emparejarán las transacciones de tarjetas de crédito, nombres, direcciones reales, así como los documentos de los empleados y correos electrónicos de la empresa".

Universidad de Washington, m�s all� de los lazos con Le�n - Revista - Diario de Le�n Zona Usuarios Diario de Le�n | Martes, 21 de mayo de 2013 Revista Titulares Env�anos tus fotos Universidad de Washington, m�s all� de los lazos con Le�n La Universidad instalada en Seattle inicia este a�o un programa en coordinaci�n con Le�n, cuyos resultados pretenden ir m�s all� del intercambio de estudiantes enviar imprimir valorar a�ade a tu blog 0 Comentarios Tweet Fernando Aller Fernando Aller 19/07/2009 Noticias relacionadas El objetivo, la doble titulaci�n La historia de la ciudad se remonta al a�o 1851, cuando lleg� el aventurero Arthur Denny con otras 26 personas y acot� unos metros cuadrados de isla para construir lo que llegar�a a ser el embri�n de Seattle, con una poblaci�n que supera hoy el medio mill�n de habitantes y que alcanza los tres millones si a�adimos lo que aqu� llamamos alfoz y all� �rea metropolitana. Es la ciudad m�s importante del Estado de Washington (no confundir con la capital Washington, que est� a 4000 kil�metros de distancia), donde se asienta la Universidad del mismo nombre y con la que Le�n mantiene ahora una relaci�n muy estrecha. Algunas diferencias son notables. Un pico volc�nico cuya altura sobrepasa los 4.000 metros se yergue blanco de nieve en pleno mes de julio sobre la suave ondulaci�n monta�osa que le circunda, territorio este �ltimo verde hasta la cima, de apenas mil metros de altitud sobre la inmediatez del Oc�ano Pac�fico. La nitidez con la que se ve esta imagen de cucurucho helado es prueba de que hoy el dios del Pico Rainier est� contento. De otra forma, permanecer�a oculto tras una sempiterna niebla. Un paisaje de contraste que vigila un lugar privilegiado, la Universidad del Estado de Washington, en la ciudad de Seattle. Ajenos a la leyenda de los antiguos indios pobladores de la zona, se mantienen los escasos estudiantes que realizan alg�n curso especial de verano en un campus semicerrado por vacaciones, cuyas calles comunican los diferentes edificios parapetados en ocasiones tras una frondosa vegetaci�n que los hace invisibles. En invierno es diferente. En la universidad de Washington 47.000 alumnos siguen alguna de las 250 titulaciones que imparte. Una cifra notable, sin duda, pero que se queda peque�a al lado de otra aut�nticamente espectacular: las 110.000 personas que viven vinculadas a esta Universidad p�blica, cifra en la que adem�s de los estudiantes, se incluyen a profesores, estudiantes, investigadores, personal de servicios y empleados de los tres hospitales universitarios. La Facultad de Medicina tiene 30 a�os de antig�edad y est� considerada como la primera en lo que a estudios de cuidados primarios se refiere. Existe un cultura que define a este centro americano y que lo diferencia de la universidad espa�ola, cuesti�n que adquiere relieve especial en Le�n habida cuenta de las estrechas relaciones que las dos instituciones mantienen ya a ambos lados del Atl�ntico, a poco menos de diez mil kil�metros de distancia. La Universidad de Washington abrir� despu�s del verano su sede en Le�n, en el Palacio de los Condes de Luna, cedido por el Ayuntamiento. La diferencia fundamental es el sentido econ�mico, la rentabilidad como concepto ligado a su propia actividad educativa. Las cifras son elocuentes: el 16% de los 37.000 millones de pres

El festival se realizará del 19 al 27 de noviembre de 2021 en València y tendrá como lema principal el Mediterráneo, las primaveras árabes: 10 años después, La primavera española: 15M y Sarajevo: 25 años después. El Festival de Derechos Humanos del Mediterráneo tendrá seis secciones, además de actividades especiales presenciales y online. La edición de 2021 estará dedicada a una reflexión sobre los movimientos sociales que sacudieron gran parte del mundo, y que tuvieron su origen en las llamadas Primaveras Árabes, cuya onda expansiva llegó a otros países mediterráneos como España en el llamado 15M, y globalmente a través de movimientos como Occupy Wall Street o We Are 99.99%.

Graves pérdidas de Malaysia Airlines en el 2014 : Mi vuelo La compañía aérea Malaysia Airlines ha dado a conocer su primer informe económico del año, referente al primer trimestre del 2014. En él puede apreciarse el daño que ha provocado en la aerolínea la desconcertante desaparición del vuelo MH370 hace ya dos meses, concretamente el pasado 8 de marzo con 239 pasajeros a bordo, y del que aún no se ha sabido con exactitud qué le ocurrió. La caída de ingresos procedente del mercado chino le ha supuesto una pérdida neta de hasta el 59%, lo que supone casi 138 millones de dólares. Los ingresos, en cambio, subieron hasta los 1.100 millones dólares. Las pérdidas supusieron un aumento de hasta un 40€ con respecto al año anterior. La presión financiera que ha tenido que soportar la compañía debido al accidente se ha añadido a los altos precios del combustible y los elevados costos operativos. Las ventas en China de Malaysia Airlines cayeron en marzo hasta un 60%, con un alto número de cancelaciones, disminución de los viajes de largo recorrido y hasta la censura de dos sitios web de reserva de vuelos. Hay que precisar que la mayoría de pasajeros que desaparecieron con el avión eran de nacionalidad china. Las autoridades del gigante asiático han criticado con dureza tanto a la compañía como al Go

Ollanta Humala y Hugo Chávez hoy en Caracas | Política | Diario La Primera El presidente electo, Ollanta Humala, se reunirá hoy en Caracas con el mandatario venezolano, Hugo Chávez, en una cita que estaba prevista hace algunas semanas pero que tuvo que suspenderse debido a la enfermedad del dignatario llanero. Ollanta habló ayer con su hermano Alexis Humala. En breve visita, presidente electo se reunirá con mandatario venezolano y el lunes partirá a México. Aunque no existen mayores detalles al respecto, fuentes de Gana Perú señalaron que el presidente electo Ollanta Humala tiene previsto viajar también a Cuba. Venezuela era uno de los principales destinos en la gira que hizo Ollanta por la región, cuyo propósito es establecer contactos con los gobiernos de Latinoamérica, pero la visita a ese país se postergó porque Chávez fue operado en Cuba hasta en dos ocasiones por un tumor cancerígeno que le mantuvo alejado de la vida pública durante varias semanas. El encuentro entre ambos ha generado mucha expectativa, pues durante la última campaña presidencial la oposición utilizó un supuesto vínculo para llevar una cruenta guerra sucia para impedir, como en el 2006, que Ollanta Humala sea ungido presidente del Perú. La visita se produce en medio de unas declaraciones del mandatario venezolano, según reseña el diario chileno "La Tercera", quien calificó la próxima asunción de Ollanta Humala a la presidencia del Perú "como el pleno amanecer de una nueva era". Según informó la oficina de prensa de Gana Perú, el esperado encuentro de Ollanta con Hugo Chávez se realizará en el Palacio de Miraflores a la

Desde el centro de Bogotá, un restaurante ha clavado las banderas de una revolución gastronómica radical, pero no desde el comercio justo o el rescate de saberes tradicionales refundidos, sino desde los platos más populares de la cocina nacional. “Que es lo más despectivo e hijueputa que los ricos han podido usar. Es un término muy peyorativo para hablar de la gente que no tiene el recurso económico suficiente para comer mejor. Primero: mire la condición económica de las personas, qué clase de educación nos dieron, cómo nos instruyeron. La gente no come “corrientazo” porque quiera sino porque no tiene para más”. Si hay algo que el ser humano tiene que hacer en esta vida es morirse y comer. Respecto al cómo y al qué comer se abre un universo de opciones que para muchos pasa por la acción automática de llenarse la barriga, para otros representa un ritual hedonista mientras que para otros tantos significa una batalla política para cambiar el mundo. En este último bando está Arturo Rojas, el que habla líneas más arriba, para quien la comida orgánica, la dieta sin gluten o los alimentos “sostenibles” son una mentira. Arturo milita de otra manera. Armando su trinchera desde un restaurante a la carta con platos populistas. Arturo es el dueño de la cadena de restaurantes Sabrosito..., que con tres locales activos en menos de diez cuadras a la redonda del centro de Bogotá, ya se ha fundido con el salpicón kitsch bogotano. Bautizado así, “al azar, simple sin ser elemental”, como dice él, es el Nuevo Testamento de su vida; una segunda etapa que llegó luego de años de haber recorrido el país capacitando profesores con con el Ministerio de Educación, organizando seminarios de literatura sobre la figura del dictador en Latinoamérica y trabajando en el empoderamiento de pequeñas comunidades de la Colombia profunda. Sabrosito… es otra bandera más para que, desde la mesa y la cocina, su revolución continúe. Nuestra conversación sucedió en la sede principal del restaurante, sobre la 7 con calle 23: un espacio sencillo que, como el propio Arturo y su aversión al WhatsApp, se resiste a pretender ser algo que no es. No más de veinte platos componen un menú que repasa los clásicos del almuerzo ejecutivo en Colombia: desde bandeja paisa y churrasco hasta paella y cazuela de mariscos, pasando por pechuga en salsa de champiñones y la estrella de la casa: la chuleta valluna. Sabrosito… se resiste al tiempo. De sus 43 empleados, la más nueva lleva nueve en nómina y la más vieja es Delia, la jefe de cocina (y jefe del sabor de todas las sedes), quien ha celebrado todos los 32 años del restaurante. Los muebles y el jardín de la sede de la 85 con 16, más al norte (local que hoy pertenece a su cuñada) se mantienen como Arturo los diseñó en los 90, mientras que el aviso, el logo y el diseño del menú son una deliciosa reminiscencia de estética ochentera. Un conservador a su manera. Mientras hablábamos sobre alimentación, marxismo, carbohidratos y conspiraciones políticas, la comida llega servida en platos blancos de plástico de dimensiones intimidantes. A algunos campos, como a la cocina y la alimentación, no se les suele reconocer como un problema político... Todo es político. Una de las mentiras más grandes que nos meten es lo de la comida orgánica. ¿Usted sabe cuáles son las dos compañías más grandes de comida chatarra del mundo? Nestle y Kellogg’s. Antes nos vendían la idea de comer cereales al desayuno cuando esa vaina lo vuelve a uno diabético. Pero a la gente le interesa la imagen en vez de decir “voy a ser solidario y sumarme a quienes hagan una campaña por la buena alimentación”. ¿Cómo insertamos un nuevo chip que cambie eso? ¿Cuánto se ahorraría cada gobierno no atendiendo casos graves de salud relacionados con mala alimentación como diabetes, enfermedades coronarias u obesidad? Primero por acción política. Quizá la utopía de mi generación era otra, no tener un iPhone, un carro o un apartamento, sino cambiar el mundo... ¡pero cambiarlo de verdad!, no con discursos. Pero nos quedamos ahí. También soy licenciado en Historia de la Universidad del Rosario y capacité profesores en toda la nación. Conozco este país al derecho y al revés, me relacioné con comunidades y aprendí que la vida es muy difícil en esta sociedad. He hecho trabajo de campo y labor social durante 40 años en pueblitos a los que la violencia ha golpeado, y vi cómo la gente, sin ninguna atención estatal, basada en lo empírico, hizo cooperativas de tejedores, de mieleros, de queseros, de yogures... ¿Y sabe quién detuvo eso? Los monopolios del Estado que cobijaban a los grandes terratenientes, que luego fueron la semilla del paramilitarismo que cortó de raíz esos fenómenos económicos que les daban la independencia a muchas comunidades, tildándolas de guerrilleras o comunistas. Por un accidente que tuve. Caí de un cuarto piso, pero como tenía que caer para no matarme. Se me reventó todo, la nariz quedó colgando, la cara me cambió, fue un proceso largo. Cuando usted está en una cama en una situación grave descubre que poquitos son los amigos que tuvo o tiene en la vida. Queda un desencanto contra todo. Pero nunca perdí mi sueño y me curé. Lloraba y decía “No me vuelvo a emplear”, a pesar de ganar un salario bueno. Un buen día con muletas me paré en la 24 con 7 y vi el edificio de Colpatria. Ahí empezó la idea mía, echándole números. Yo iba a vender empanadas donde fuera. El accidente, en 1985. En 1986 fundé el restaurante. Empecé en la 24 con 7 donde ahora está Kokoriko y luego me trasladé a este local. En 1989 abrí el de la 27 con 7; en 1993 el de la calle 18 con 7, que ba

Benavente celebra su III Semana de la Familia | ZamoraDigital.net Inicio Noticias Benavente Benavente celebra su III Semana de la Familia La Delegación Diocesana para la Familia y Defensa de la Vida organiza por tercer año consecutivo, junto con el Arciprestazgo de Benavente, la Semana de la Familia, en la que se abordarán temas como el amor y la sexualidad, el efecto en los niños de las redes sociales e Internet, y la identidad de la familia cristiana. Benavente acogerá, del 26 al 28 de abril, la III Semana de la Familia, que en años anteriores ha contado con gran aceptación en la ciudad, y que ahora vuelve de la mano de sus dos organizadores, la Delegación Diocesana para la Familia y Defensa de la Vida y el Arciprestazgo de Benavente. Todas las conferencias se celebrarán en el Centro Parroquial de Santa María la Mayor (c/ Cabildo, 7) a las 20,30 horas.

Recomiendan a IFE adquirir urnas electrónicas para comicios Notimex20.09.2013 - 14:57h El vicepresidente de Información Demográfica y Social del Inegi, Félix Vélez Fernández Varela, recomendó al IFE adquirir urnas electorales pues, desde su perspectiva, "el beneficio que se pueda obtener con su uso rebasa enormemente al costo en el que se pudiera incurrir". En el Congreso Internacional Tecnología y Elecciones, planteó que "en términos de costo-beneficio es altamente conveniente invertir en urnas electrónicas porque hoy en día se tiene la tecnología para que esto se haga y se haga bien, y se haga con eficiencia y precisión". Durante el segundo y último día de trabajos del encuentro organizado por el Instituto Federal Electoral (IFE), el funcionario del Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía (Inegi) recordó que se han aplicado medidas en el país para evitar los trastornos que los llamados hackers pudieran ocasionar a ese sistema. Abundó que utilizar ese método de votación sirve para que haya más certidumbre y eficiencia en los modelos electorales, "el beneficio que se pueda obtener rebasa enormemente al costo en el que se pudiera incurrir". Félix Vélez enfatizó que usar las urnas electrónicas redundaría en que haya certidumbre en el país, condición necesaria para la inversión, la generación de empleos y aumentar la producción. Ante expertos en la materia nacionales e internacionales, aclaró que el Inegi es una institución autónoma, por lo que pidió que a su respuesta no se le dé alguna connotación política escondida. "Lo voy a decir en términos estrictamente de costo beneficio, y ya, sin meterme a otro tipo de cuestiones que al menos públicamente en mi carácter de funcionario del Inegi no me tocan", refirió. El funcionario estimó que entre 2015 y 2018 más de la mitad de los hogares del país tendrán Internet, que actualmente es de 12 por ciento, con lo que se facilitaría el voto electrónico. Asimismo, comentó que en el Censo de 2010 no se utilizaron dispositivos electrónicos porque faltaban algunos detalles, p

Babel Web Anthology :: Esterházy Péter: Harmonia Cælestis (172) Esterházy Péter: Harmonia Cælestis (172) Armonía Celestial (172) (Spanish) Nos despertamos al alba por un ruido brutal: estaban aporreando la puerta como si fuera un tambor. Durante el invierno, papi se levanta a las seis, enciende las dos estufas de hierro (con carbón de coque y carbón prensado en pastillas en forma de huevos); lo vemos medio dormidos, vuela por la habitación sin abrigo, con su gorro de piel en la cabeza, con el cuello levantado de la americana, como si fuera primavera, y con el cigarrillo encendido en la boca. (Nosotros también teníamos un gorro de piel cada uno: el de mi hermano era marrón y tan suave que le gustaba mucho; el mío no era tan agradable al tacto, no me gustaba llevarlo porque me picaba.) – Seguid durmiendo, cachorros – nos dice si oye que nos movemos. Nunca prepara nada la noche anterior, no pone ni el carbón ni la leña para encender las estufas, corta la leña por la mañana. Se trata de una ciencia complicada. Agarra el hacha con una mano, cerca de la hoja, y corta la leña como lo haría con una navaja. Como si pintara una acuarela utilizando una brocha de encalar. Tras unos cuantos cortes, el tronco ya no se mantiene en pie solo, y entonces mi papi, tan hábil y tan listo que lo sabe todo, pone el tronco en equilibrio con la mano izquierda, lo suelta y en el mismo instante eterno le da con el hacha, con un movimiento de la muñeca, un golpe seco y decidido. Más adelante, ya no existe ni siquiera el breve instante eterno, el dedo índice de la mano izquierda mantiene el tronco en pie, en ese caso se puede golpear con el hacha todavía desde más cerca, o bien la mano derecha aprieta el tronco en la parte inferior: en ese caso el golpe de hacha es más libre, es preciso tener cuidado de que el hacha no se deslice. Mami se levanta a las seis y media (durante el verano a las seis), y nosotros a las siete, cuando ya hace calor y el desayuno está preparado. «El día en que yo sea padre, también cortaré la leña cuando todos estén durmiendo todavía, en silencio, encenderé las estufas, nadie sabrá cómo, la casa se llenará de repente de calor.» (Unos años más tarde empezaría a venderse el prende-fuego Tüker, y más adelante se instalaría la calefacción de gas. Por las mañanas la casa está caliente.) Parecía que iban a tirar la puerta de la casa a hachazos. – ¡Abran! ¡Abran inmediatamente! Parecía que unos gigantescos ángeles malvados pretendían fabricar unos prende-fuegos Tüker con nosotros. Papi va a abrir en pijama, despeinado, por las mañanas siempre está despeinado, aunque nosotros sólo lo vemos los domingos, hoy es lunes («Ein Struwelpeter», decimos más tarde. «¡Vaya, vaya!», dice él todavía más tarde), tiene el pelo levantado por los dos lados, como si fueran dos alas, completamente revuelto por detrás, un montón de paja, como si se hubiese peleado con la almohada, y por delante – esto es lo más increíble – le cae sobre la frente, como si se hubiese peinado: parece un emperador romano o un niño idiota. Se da cuenta de que lo estamos observando, se detiene. – ¡Abran o tiraremos la puerta! – ¡No tengáis miedo, cachorros! – ¡No tenemos miedo, querido padre! – le decimos, gritando a coro, porque de repente sólo lo vemos a él, a ese emperador romano chistoso, ridículo y soñoliento en pijama cuyo pantalón se le cae todo el rato, sólo a él, así que no debemos tener miedo de nada. Lo miramos con una expresión de estar preparados para la batalla, como para darle ánimos: ¡si nosotros no tenemos miedo, él todavía menos! En ese instante, mientras el ruido se vuelve cada vez más amenazador (nadie en el mundo, ni siquiera mami, se habría atrevido a hacerlo, habría podido hacerlo, encontrar tiempo para hacerlo, cualquiera en su sano juicio habría corrido a abrir la puerta), nos acaricia uno por uno, a mí en la cara, a mi hermano el cabello, y de repente, de manera totalmente inesperada para nosotros, se echa a reír y dice: – ¡¿Así que no tenéis miedo?! Me parece una exageración. Como en las películas, los soldados entran deprisa. Les habrán entrenado para ocupar una habitación con niños o un dormitorio con enemigos peligrosos, se mueven rápido, dando saltos previamente ensayados, se apoyan en la pared, cubren al que avanza. Nos impresionan muchísimo, a mí y a mi hermano, observamos la carga boquiabiertos, y cuando terminan su cometido, cuando ya han ocupado, visiblemente sin derramar una sola gota de sangre, nuestra casa, habiendo vencido al enemigo en cuestión de pocos minutos, nosotros dos empezamos a aplaudir, por lo que nuestra madre se acerca, ciñéndose la bata por el frío, como si se agarrara a sí misma por la solapa, y nos pega un cachete en la cabeza: – ¡A callar! Papi está de pie junto a la puerta, nunca le hemos visto ese rostro, está pálido, extenuado, su rostro parece caerse, corno si no fuera suyo, como si sólo lo hubiese alquilado. Durante las noches en el porche de Hort, su rostro regio debe de haber sido así, aunque ahora está todavía más oscuro, completamente ensombrecido. Sin embargo, su gesto tras la invasión, al sacar la cabeza para mirar afuera, ha sido casi alegre, o si ha delatado susto, se ha tratado de un susto propio de una comedia. Detrás de los soldados aparece un hombre joven, vestido de paisano, como si se hubiera quedado atrás, como si hubiera llegado tarde, un hombre rubio, torpe, con gafas, parece un maestro, pero es más amable, más suave. Como parte de la comedia, le da unos golpecitos en el hombro a mi padre, que sigue mirando hacia afuera. – La casa está rodeada – dice como explicación, como si papi hubiera estado tratando de verificar eso, o como si hubiese estado sopesando las posibilidades de fuga. Nuestro padre se endereza y dice, asintiendo con la cabeza: – Muy bien. Así debe ser. Lo dice varias veces, como si estuviera diciendo las últimas palabras de un chiste gracioso. – ¡Cuídate, Mati mío! – le dice mami susurrando, pero papi no lo oye, sólo nosotros podemos escuchar esa confesión amorosa (nunca, ni antes, ni después, hemos oído ninguna confesión amorosa por parte de ninguno de los dos). El joven mira a nuestro padre con sorpresa y con compasión y le dice en voz baja, olvidándose de emplear el tono oficial: – No tenga usted miedo, no hay por qué tener miedo, los camaradas rusos están examinando todas las casas. Están buscando a contrarrevolucionarios en el pueblo. – Muy bien – repite mi padre asintiendo con la cabeza. – Shto? Shto? – pregunta, para saber qué está diciendo, uno de los rusos, el comandante: aunque son todos parecidos, todos muy jóvenes, se nota que él es el jefe. Hasta ahora, sólo hemos reparado en sus uniformes y en sus armas, pero en sus rostros no. Ahora, mi hermano dice con un suspiro, muy sorprendido: – ¡Mami! ¡Son chinos! – Shto? Shto? – vuelve a preguntar el jefe, volviéndose hacia nosotros. Mi madre menea la cabeza, muy rápido y muy seguido como si no fuera a detenerse nunca, para decir que nada, que no ocurre nada, que nadie ha dicho nada, que nadie piensa nada, que nosotros no estamos presentes, que no estamos en ningún lugar, que sigan cumpliendo con su deber, haciendo lo que tienen que hacer, examinarlo todo, que nosotros cerraremos los ojos. Nos obligan a salir de la cama, nos ponemos de pie, al lado de nuestros padres, como en fila india. Mi hermano no tiene miedo, pero yo le digo que no tenga miedo, pues las ejecuciones nunca se llevan a cabo dentro de una casa. – Shto? Shto? Como ya comprendo la pregunta, la respondo: le explico que acabo de decirle a mi hermano pequeño que no tenga miedo, que las ejecuciones nunca se llevan a cabo dentro de una casa, miro al joven de gafas para que traduzca, y él se pone a traducir inesperadamente. El jefe se echa a reír y luego dice algo, pero ya sin reír. – ¿Hay armas escondidas en la casa? – traduce mi traductor. – No – responde inmediatamente mi padre. – Sí que hay – replica mi hermano. Por alguna razón, esto último no hay que traducirlo, lo comprenden todos, los soldados nos apuntan con sus armas sin que nadie se lo ordene. ¿A lo mejor yo estoy mal informado, y sí que se pueden llevar a cabo ejecuciones dentro de una casa? ¿A lo mejor puede formarse un pelotón de fusilamiento en cualquier sitio? Es evidente que los chinos tienen pánico de mi hermano. Ahora nuestro padre es el único que no tiene pánico, está muy enfadado, se le mueve la mandíbula. – Idi sudá – dice el comandante muy serio. Con lo del «Ven aquí» mami se estremece y nos abraza de inmediato. Ahora tenemos miedo los tres. – No tenga miedo, señora, se trata de un control rutinario, no hay ningún problema – dice el intérprete. Está mintiendo. También él tiene miedo. Miente por empatía. – Idi sudá – repite el chino. – ¡No! ¡No irá a ninguna parte! – protesta mi madre gritando, justo a mi oído. Nos abraza con más fuerza. – Al menos podrían dejar de apuntarnos con las armas – dice papi en voz muy baja. Estas palabras les ponen nerviosos. A nosotros suele decirnos que no juguemos con armas, pero que si es completamente inevitable, por lo menos no nos apuntemos. «Un hombre nunca debe apuntar a otro hombre con un arma», solía decirnos. Sonaba como un precepto. Por las noches nos lavaremos los dientes; durante el día no apuntaremos a nadie con un arma. – ¿Y si los pechenegos y/o los tergiares atacan nuestra patria? – preguntó un día nuestra hermana. – Eso es distinto – respondió nuestro padre con desgana.

AST-GOT Y ALT-GPT susana el Lun Ene 11, 2010 12:56 pm Quería haceros una consulta, a ver si me podeis ayudar. Tras varios intentos por ajustar la dosis de depakine a mi hijo, ya estamos a nivel, concretamente tiene 80,8 mg/L. En la última analítica (tras la subida de medicación) han salido unos niveles de ALT-GOT de 71 U/L (lo normal es menos de 40) y niveles de ALT-GPT de 42 U/L (lo normal es menos de 40). Tanto la neuro como el pediatra me han tranquilizado diciendo que no son "preocupantes", pero que hay que llevar un seguimiento exhaustivo de la función hepática. O sea, que repetimos análisis en 15 días. Mi duda es si esto es habitual cuando se sube una medicación y después se normaliza y en que influye el hecho de tener estos niveles altos. Los demás valores bioquímicos y hematológicos son normales. Re: Depakine y tr

Desarrollado por la NASA en los años setenta, el Centro de Investigación de la NASA, desarrolló este material con el fin de proteger a los astronautas de la fuerza de la gravedad en las lanzaderas espaciales y mejorar su posición sentada. La particularidad más importante de este revolucionario material utilizado en productos para el descanso, es que a diferencia del resto, es una material sensible a la temperatura del cuerpo, que se adapta a nuestro peso y no lo empuja de nuevo cuando nos apoyamos en él. De esta manera no hay opresión en nuestros vasos sanguíneos y la circulación es mucho más fluida aliviando así los problemas de cervicales, dolores de cabeza, estrés, migrañas y jaquecas. Alivio sistemático de la presión, correcta circulación sanguínea, alivio contra dolores cervicales de la cabeza, estrés e insomnio. Eliminación de tensiones en nuca y cuello.

Suñén: Emparejando calcetines Se lo leo a ustedes en voz alta: ¿Acabarán algún día las guerras y el sufrimiento? ¿Qué nos sucede al morir? ¿Hay alguna esperanza para los muertos? ¿Cómo tenemos que orar para que Dios nos escuche? ¿Encontraremos la felicidad? Son preguntas que he encontrado en un panfleto que alguien, posiblemente un joven manipulado por sus cofrades de más edad, ha dejado en nuestro buzón de Magaz de Abajo. Como ahora soy pobre me sobra el tiempo, así que lo dedico a cepillar al gato, hacerle más caso a Raquel, atender los sabios consejos de mi hijo Lucas, vestirme a la oriental, leer panfletos absurdos (incluido el periódico) y sacar conclusiones. La parte más difícil es sacar conclusiones, porque con las conclusiones pasa lo mismo que con la meditación trascendental: – Estoy meditando. – Ya me has distraído. Las conclusiones deben salir de alguna parte, a ser posible de una meditación no trascendental y, desde luego, deben exhibir cierta intención de servicio público. Servidor, sin ir más lejos, llegó el otro día a la conclusión de que lo que le ha ocurrido al capitalismo neo liberal es que se ha muerto. Saqué mi conclusión emparejando calcetines. Emparejar calcetines es una de esas actividades que deberían ser obligatorias en las carreras universitarias, incluso en los másteres esos que los jóvenes no entienden. Se pone uno a emparejar calcetines y descubre inmediatamente que las cosas no están tan mal como parecían en un principio. Servidor, miren ustedes por donde, ha resultado ser poseedor de una cantidad de pares de calcetines que, en un principio, duda mucho que pudiesen igualar los vestidores de los líderes de los principales partidos políticos del país, incluido el gobernante. Y los de los banqueros menos todavía. Me preguntaba, emparejando calcetines, por qué me he dedicado a la poesía en lugar de s

En el Consejo de Financoop está un hermano del ex intendente Marcelo Trivelli, el hermano del ex diputado PPD Enrique Accorsi y Sergio Fernández Aguayo, conocido militante DC. Además lideran la compañía Ernesto Livacic y Daniel Albarrán, ambos ex funcionarios de los gobiernos de Eduardo Frei y Ricardo Lagos, como superintendente de Bancos y subsecretario de Pesca, respectivamente. Estos últimos son ex ejecutivos del grupo Norte Sur, que controló el Banco del Desarrollo hasta que lo vendió a Scotiabank en 2008, y que lideraba Vicente Caruz. En efecto, según publicó Ciper en septiembre pasado, Caruz estaba ofreciendo a otras cooperativas un proyecto de consolidación de varias en un banco, partiendo por Financoop.

El portavoz del Gobierno catalán cree que no hay «marcha atrás» y que la consulta se debe hacer cuanto antes | Teinteresa El portavoz del Gobierno catalán cree que no hay «marcha atrás» y que la consulta se debe hacer cuanto antes El portavoz del Gobierno catalán, Francesc Homs, asegura que no hay «marcha atrás» hacia el Estado propio y que la consulta de autodeterminación se debe celebrar cuanto antes mejor, aunque no ha querido establecer un plazo. En declaraciones a Rac1 recogidas por Europa Press, ha afirmado que el Estado propio es la prioridad y que la »hoja de ruta» debe pasar por hacer una consulta con garantías, que haya una mayoría social muy amplia a favor del Estado propio y que exista el compromiso inequívoco de estar «sí o sí» dentro de Europa. «Somos contribuidores netos en la Unión Europea; es impensable que se nos eche –ha dicho el portavoz del Govern–.

Este 14 de abril se cumplen 80 años de la proclamación de l II República Española y el 24 de mayo el 70 aniversario del fusilamiento en Paterna del Dr. Juan B. Peset Aleixandre, catedrático y rector de la Universidad de Valencia, presidente de Izquierda Republicana en Valencia y diputado. Con motivo de esta efemérides, la AGRUPACION DE FAMILIARES DE VICTIMAS FUSILADAS EN EL MURO DE PATERNA, el GRUPO PARA LA RECUPERACIÓN DE LA MEMORIA HISTÓRICA, la PLATAFORMA CIVICA VALENCIANA DE APOYO AL JUEZ GARZON, la COMISSIÓ DE LA VERITAT, la ASOCIACIÓ CÍVICA JOAN BAPTISTA PESET ALEIXANDRE y LA UNIVERSITAT DE VALENCIA convocan un acto de homenaje a las víctimas de la represión franquista, que se celebrará el domingo 17 de abril a las 12,30 en el Cementerio de Paterna. La ASOCIACION MEMORIAL DEMOCRATICO 23 DE ABRIL se suma a esta convocatoria e invita a la participación en este acto de reivindicación de los que perdieron su vida a manos del fascismo. El sábado 13 de abril desde las 20’00 horas se disputará la vuelta de semifinales de Copa Diputación que enfrentará al Club Atlético Menciano y Villarrubia C.F. En el duelo de ida disputado el primer fin de semana del mes de abril en Córdoba, las de Doña Mencía consiguieron llevarse una renta de 0-1 gracias al tanto de Inma Reina. Tras superar al CD Hinojosa, uno de los favoritos, en la fase de Cuartos de final con aparente solvencia, en estas semifinales se está enfrentando a otro de los conjuntos que desde los inicios del féminas en Doña Mencía ha estado mano a mano en las rondas finales de estos títulos. Ya que parece, que la Copa Diputación es la competición fetiche para el femenino en las últimas campañas. JUAN MANUEL MAGAÑA Periodista...

209.5 millones Brasil ha avanzado en gran medida en la década pasada en la mejora de la calidad de vida de sus ciudadanos. Brasil alcanza buenos resultados solo en unas cuantas dimensiones del bienestar en comparación con la mayoría de los países incluidos en el Índice para una Vida Mejor. Brasil tiene en promedio mejor desempeño en compromiso cívico, pero su desempeño es menor en promedio en ingreso, empleo, educación, salud, relaciones sociales, satisfacción ante la vida. Estos resultados se basan en una selección de datos disponibles. Aunque el dinero no puede comprar la felicidad, es un medio importante para lograr estándares de vida más elevados. En Brasil, el ingreso familiar disponible neto ajustado promedio per cápita es menor que el promedio de la OCDE de 30 490 USD al año. En términos de empleo, cerca del 57% de las personas de 15 a 64 años de edad en Brasil tienen un empleo remunerado, cifra menor que el promedio de la OCDE de 66%. Cerca del 67% de los hombres tienen un empleo remunerado, en comparación con el 47% de las mujeres. En Brasil el 7% de los empleados tienen un horario de trabajo remunerado muy largo, cifra menor que el promedio de la OCDE de 10%; el 7% de los hombres trabajan con remuneración muchas horas en comparación con el 4% de las mujeres. Tener un buen nivel educativo y de competencias es un requisito importante para encontrar empleo. En Brasil, el 57% de los adultos de 25 a 64 años han terminado la educación media superior, cifra menor que el promedio de la OCDE de 79%. Sin embargo, esto se aplica más en el caso de las mujeres que en el de los hombres, ya que el 53% de ellos han terminado con éxito la educación media superior en comparación con el 60% de las mujeres. En términos de calidad de la educación, el estudiante promedio obtuvo un resultado de 400 puntos en lectura, matemáticas y ciencias en el Programa para la Evaluación Internacional de Alumnos (PISA, por sus siglas en inglés) de la OCDE. Este resultado es menor que la media de la OCDE de 488. En promedio en Brasil, las niñas superaron a los niños por 6 puntos, diferencia ligeramente mayor que el promedio OCDE de 5 puntos. En el campo de la salud, en Brasil la esperanza de vida al nacer es de 76 años, cinco años menor que el promedio de la OCDE de 81 años. La esperanza de vida para las mujeres se sitúa en los 80 años, en comparación con 72 para los hombres. El nivel de partículas atmosféricas PM2.5 —partículas contaminantes del aire lo suficientemente pequeñas como para penetrar en los pulmones y dañarlos— es de 11.7 microgramos por metro cúbico, cifra menor que el promedio de la OCDE de 14 microgramos por metro cúbico. En Brasil, el 70% de las personas dicen estar satisfechas con la calidad del agua, cifra menor que el promedio de la OCDE de 84%. En lo que concierne al ámbito público, en Brasil hay un moderado sentido de comunidad y altos niveles de compromiso cívico: el 83% de las personas creen conocer a alguien en quien pueden confiar cuando lo necesiten, cifra menor que el promedio de la OCDE de 91%. La participación electoral, una medida de la participación ciudadana en el proceso político, fue del 80% durante elecciones recientes. Esta cifra es mayor que el promedio de la OCDE de 68% y refleja la práctica de votación obligatoria de Brasil. La situación económica y social puede afectar la tasa de votación; la participación electoral de la población que ocupa el 20% superior de la escala de ingresos se estima en 81% y para la que ocupa el 20% inferior, se estima en 79%. Al pedírseles que calificaran su satisfacción general ante la vida en una escala de 0 a 10, los brasileños le otorgaron una calificación promedio de 6.1, cifra menor al promedio de la OCDE de 6.7. Brasil en Detalle Vivienda – Brasil más Además de los costos de vivienda, es importante estudiar las condiciones de vida, como el promedio de habitaciones compartidas por persona y si las viviendas tienen acceso a servicios básicos. El número de habitaciones de una vivienda, dividido entre el número de personas que la habitan, indica si los residentes viven en condiciones de hacinamiento. Una vivienda superpoblada puede tener un impacto negativo en la salud física y mental, en las relaciones con otras personas y en el desarrollo de los hijos. Asimismo, el hacinamiento suele traducirse en un suministro inadecuado de agua y de servicios de alcantarillado. En Brasil, el hogar promedio tiene un número de habitaciones por persona menor que el promedio de la OCDE de 1.7. En términos de servicios básicos, 93.3% de las viviendas en Brasil que tienen acceso privado a inodoros interiores con descarga de agua, una cifra menor que el promedio de la OCDE de 97%. Ingresos – Brasil más El ingreso familiar disponible neto ajustado es la cantidad de dinero que una familia percibe, o gana, cada año después de impuestos y transferencias. Representa el dinero del que dispone una familia para gastar en bienes o servicios. En Brasil, el ingreso familiar disponible neto ajustado promedio per cápita es mucho menor que el promedio de la OCDE de 30 490 USD. El patrimonio familiar neto es el monto total de los activos financieros y no financieros que posee una familia, como dinero o acciones en cuentas bancarias, la residencia principal, otros bienes inmuebles, vehículos, objetos de valor y otros activos no financieros (por ejemplo, otros bienes de consumo duraderos). En Brasil, el patrimonio familiar neto es considerablemente menor que el promedio de la OCDE de 323 960 USD. Empleo – Brasil más Tener empleo aporta muchos beneficios importantes, incluyendo proporcionar una fuente de ingresos, la mejora de la inclusión social, satisfacer las aspiraciones personales, fortalecer la autoestima y desarrollar capacidades y competencias. En Brasil, el 57% de la población en edad laboral (entre 15 y 64 años) tiene un empleo remunerado. Esta cifra es menor que el promedio de empleo de la OCDE de 66%. La definición de desempleado se refiere a aquellos que no trabajan actualmente pero que están dispuestos a hacerlo y que están buscando empleo activamente. El desempleo a largo plazo puede tener un gran efecto negativo en los sentimientos de bienestar y autoestima, y genera la pérdida de capacidades, con lo que las posibilidades de conseguir empleo se reducen aún más. En Brasil, el porcentaje de la fuerza laboral que ha estado desempleada durante un año o más es en la actualidad mayor que el promedio de la OCDE de 1.3%. Los salarios y los otros beneficios monetarios que aporta el empleo son aspectos importantes de la calidad en el empleo. Los brasileños ganan menos que el promedio de la OCDE de 49 165 USD. Otro factor esencial de la calidad en el empleo es la seguridad en este, en términos de la pérdida esperada de ingresos cuando alguien queda desempleado. Esto incluye el grado de probabilidad de perder el empleo, la duración del probable periodo de desempleo y cuánta ayuda financiera puede esperarse del gobierno. Los empleados que corren un riesgo más alto de perder su empleo son más vulnerables, en especial en países con sistemas de seguridad social más reducidos. En Brasil, los trabajadores afrontan un riesgo estimado de pérdida de ingresos en caso de quedar desempleados mayor que el promedio de la OCDE de 5.1%. Los empleos informales ponen a los trabajadores bajo riesgo de recibir menos sueldo, prestaciones y protección legal. En Brasil, la tasa de informalidad bajó más de 12 puntos porcentuales desde 2000, debido a la combinación de un crecimiento económico más fuerte e intervenciones específicas de políticas públicas. El país es ahora uno de los casos de mayor éxito en América Latina en lo que se refiere a reducir la informalidad. Estudios realizados sugieren que disminuir los trámites administrativos para registrar a una pequeña empresa con hasta un empleado, lo que incluye la posibilidad de registrarla siguiendo unos cuantos pasos en línea y reglas más sencillas para cumplir con los pagos de impuestos y contribuciones, ayudó a la formalización de cerca de 500 000 microempresas y cerca de dos millones de empleos durante cinco años. Al mismo tiempo, la experiencia de Brasil muestra que dichos programas implican compensaciones, ya que un trato demasiado diferente entre las empresas pequeñas y las grandes puede reducir los incentivos para que los negocios crezcan. Comunidad – Brasil más Educación – Brasil más Una población bien educada y bien capacitada es esencial para el bienestar social y económico de un país. La educación desempeña un papel fundamental para proporcionar a las personas los conocimientos, las capacidades y las competencias necesarias para participar de manera efectiva en la sociedad y en la economía. Tener una buena educación mejora en gran medida la probabilidad de encontrar empleo y de ganar suficiente dinero. Los brasileños pueden esperar pasar 16.2 años en el sistema educativo entre los 5 y los 39 años de edad, cifra menor que el promedio de la OCDE de 18 años. Obtener un título de educación media superior cobra una creciente importancia en todos los países, ya que las competencias necesarias en el mercado laboral se basan cada vez más en los conocimientos. Por consiguiente, las tasas de graduación del bachillerato indican con claridad si un país está preparando a sus estudiantes para cubrir los requerimientos mínimos de ese mercado laboral. En Brasil, el 57% de los adultos entre 25 y 64 años de edad ha terminado la educación media superior, cifra mucho menor que el promedio de la OCDE de 79%. El estudiante medio en Brasil obtuvo un resultado de 400 puntos en lectura, matemáticas y ciencias, cifra menor que el promedio de la OCDE de 488. Los sistemas escolares con mejores resultados logran brindar educación de alta calidad a todos los estudiantes. La labor de alfabetización financiera en las escuelas es parte importante de la Estrategia Nacional Brasileña para la Educación Financiera (ENBEF). El programa integra la educación financiera al plan de estudios de secundaria e incorpora casos prácticos sobre alfabetización financiera a las matemáticas, la lengua y la literatura, las ciencias, la sociología y otras disciplinas. En la evaluación de un estudio piloto efectuado en 891 escuelas secundarias en seis estados del país, se encontró que el nivel medio de competencia y autonomía financieras y la actitud hacia los ahorros era más alto en quienes participaron en el programa. En las familias en las que los estudiantes tomaron el programa aumentaron los conocimientos financieros parentales y un mayor número de ellas comenzó a elaborar presupuestos para el hogar. El gobierno también llevará a cabo programas piloto de educación financiera en las escuelas primarias. Recompensar a los buenos docentes Pernambuco y Río de Janeiro implementaron programas para recompensar a los buenos docentes. Si resultan exitosas, estas iniciativas podrían extenderse a todo el país, con miras a mejorar la calidad de los profesores y del aprendizaje en Brasil. El programa de bonos para docentes de Pernambuco recompensa el desempeño más que los conocimientos sobre la materia y opera en el nivel escolar más que en el individual. Los objetivos de la mejora escolar se fijan cada año y las escuelas que alcanzan por lo menos el 50% reciben un bono proporcional a su desempeño. Por ejemplo, en las escuelas que alcanzan el 75% de sus objetivos, el personal docente y no docente recibe el 75% del bono medio (prorrateado por nivel salarial). De nuevo, se realizan evaluaciones profundas y continuas del programa, pero los resultados iniciales sugieren que las escuelas con objetivos más ambiciosos alcanzaron mayores avances y los niveles de aprendizaje en todo el estado mejoraron de forma considerable. Río de Janeiro adoptó un programa de bonos similar al de Pernambuco, el cual también establece objetivos de mejora en el nivel escolar como la base para otorgar reconocimientos monetarios. Sin embargo, el programa de Río impone además fuertes sanciones por faltas de los docentes: los empleados con más de cinco faltas durante el año escolar no calificarían para recibirla. Medio ambiente – Brasil más Los niveles de partículas PM2.5 —lo suficientemente pequeñas como para penetrar hasta la parte más profunda de los pulmones— se monitorizan en los países de la OCDE porque pueden dañar la salud humana y reducir la esperanza de vida. En Brasil, los niveles de partículas PM2.5 son de 11.7 microgramos por metro cúbico, cifra menor que el promedio de la OCDE de 14 microgramos por metro cúbico pero mayor que el límite anual recomendado de 10 microgramos por metro cúbico por la Organización Mundial de la Salud. El acceso a agua limpia es fundamental para el bienestar humano. A pesar de los avances significativos conseguidos en los países de la OCDE en cuanto a la reducción de la contaminación del agua, no siempre es fácil discernir las mejoras en la calidad del agua potable. En Brasil, el 70% de los habitantes dicen estar satisfechos con la calidad del agua, cifra menor que el promedio de la OCDE de 84%. Compromiso cívico – Brasil más La confianza en el gobierno es esencial para la cohesión y el bienestar sociales. Una participación electoral alta es un parámetro para medir la participación ciudadana en el proceso político. En las elecciones más recientes de las que se cuenta con datos, la participación electoral en Brasil fue del 80% de las personas registradas. Esta cifra es mayor que el promedio de la OCDE de 69%, y refleja la práctica de votación obligatoria de Brasil. Si bien el derecho a votar es universal en todos los países cubiertos por el BLI, no todas las personas lo ejercen. Hay poca diferencia en las tasas de participación electoral de hombres y mujeres en la mayoría de los países miembros de la OCDE. Una mayor participación pública en el proceso de toma de decisiones es también fundamental para exigir la rendición de cuentas por parte del gobierno y mantener la confianza en las instituciones públicas. El proceso formal de participación de la ciudadanía en la elaboración de leyes y regulaciones es una manera de medir el grado en el cual las personas pueden involucrarse en la toma de decisiones gubernamentales sobre asuntos clave que afectan su vida. En Brasil, el nivel de participación ciudadana en la elaboración de regulaciones es de 2.2 (en una escala de 0 a 4), cifra superior al promedio de la OCDE de 2.1. Movilizar a ciudadanos, empresas y sociedad civil El gobierno brasileño sostiene que involucrar a los ciudadanos en la toma de decisiones los hace corresponsables del desarrollo de las políticas. Esto permite el debate social tan necesario acerca de las políticas públicas y la prestación de servicios públicos. Entre 2003 y 2009, el gobierno federal de Brasil organizó 60 conferencias nacionales e internacionales sobre una amplia gama de áreas de política pública, reuniendo a 4 millones de personas pertenecientes al sector público, al sector del voluntariado y a los ciudadanos, y acercando más a la sociedad la producción de servicios públicos. El Consejo de Desarrollo Económico y Social es otro buen ejemplo de los esfuerzos gubernamentales por involucrar a los ciudadanos en la discusión de las políticas públicas. El Consejo se creó en 2003 para debatir aspectos sobre desarrollo entre el gobierno y la sociedad, e incluye a trabajadores, empresas, movimientos sociales y especialistas en áreas particulares del conocimiento. Además, una red nacional para mejorar la gestión pública y reducir los trámites burocráticos ha participado activamente en el debate sobre las reformas. La red consta de funcionarios públicos, empresas, organizaciones no gubernamentales, académicos, estudiantes y ciudadanos en general. Salud – Brasil más Satisfacción ante la vida – Brasil más La satisfacción ante la vida mide la manera en que las personas evalúan, más que sus sentimientos actuales, su vida en su conjunto. Al pedirles que calificaran su satisfacción general ante la vida en una escala del 0 al 10, en promedio los brasileños le asignaron una puntuación de 6.14, cifra menor que el promedio de la OCDE de 6.7. Seguridad – Brasil más La seguridad individual es un factor determinante para el bienestar de las personas. ¿Se siente seguro al caminar a solas por la noche, por ejemplo? En Brasil, cerca del 45% de las personas afirman sentirse seguras al caminar a solas por la noche, cifra mucho menor que el promedio de la OCDE de 74%. La tasa de homicidios (el número de asesinatos por cada 100 000 habitantes) es una medida más confiable del nivel de seguridad de un país debido a que, a diferencia de otros delitos, los asesinatos siempre se denuncian a la policía. Según la información más reciente de la OCDE, la tasa de homicidios en Brasil es de 19, cifra más de siete veces mayor que el promedio de la OCDE de 2.6. Equilibrio laboral-personal – Brasil más Un aspecto importante del equilibro laboral-personal es el número de horas que una persona trabaja. La evidencia sugiere que un horario de trabajo largo puede resultar perjudicial para la salud, poner en peligro la seguridad y aumentar el estrés. En Brasil alrededor del 6% de los empleados tienen un trabajo remunerado con horarios muy largo, cifra menor que el promedio de la OCDE de 10%. Cuanto más trabajen las personas, menos tiempo tendrán para dedicarlo a otras actividades, como el tiempo que pasan con otras personas, el ocio, comer o dormir. La cantidad y la calidad del tiempo libre son fundamentales para el bienestar general de las personas y pueden generar beneficios adicionales para la salud física y mental. En Brasil los empleados de tiempo completo dedican de media el mismo porcentaje de su d

Maxi Sánchez y Martín Di Nenno: savia nueva para renovar las aspiraciones del 'Tiburón' Creada. 06-10-2020 | 18:18 H Última actualización. 06-10-2020 | 18:18 H Con el firme propósito de revertir una tendencia algo negativa de resultados, el argentino Maxi Sánchez daba un cambio de rumbo y decidía separarse de su ya ex-compañero y gran amigo Matías Díaz. La unión del 'Tiburón' y el 'Warrior' no funcionaba en esta segunda etapa como en la primera y aunque su estilo siempre rocoso ayudó a cosechar victorias, no les dio para alcanzar la pelea por los títulos. Así, estas dos parejas intercambian sus piezas entre sí y no modifican al resto. Ha

Todos habremos visto a estas alturas, las fotos de Batman vs Bane en medio de lo que parece ser una pelea entre polis y matones. Pero la sorpresa viene con la foto que enlazo más abajo, ya que Marion Cotillard encarna a Miranda Tate, una miembro de Wayne Enterprises que ayudará a Bruce Wayne con los proyectos filantrópicos de su padre (según wikipedia). Desde cuando una ejecutiva se ve envuelta en una batalla entre policias y matones??? No será que la sorpresa es que ella terminará siendo SPOILER Despues de mucho tiempo sin entrar por aqui por varios motivos, hoy traigo novedades (que seguro que todos ya sabreis). Un saludo!!

MITO DEFINICIÓN: es un relato tradicional de acontecimientos prodigiosos, protagonizados por seres sobrenaturales o extraordinarios, tales como dioses, semidioses, héroes o mosntruos. 3. TIPOS DE MITOS Mitos cosmogónicos : intentan explicar la creación del mundo. Son los más universalmente extendidos y de los que existe mayor cantidad. A menudo, se sitúa el origen de la tierra en un océano primigenio. A veces, una raza de gigantes, como los titanes, desempeña una función determinante en esta creación; en este caso, tales gigantes, que suelen ser semidioses, constituyen la primera población de la tierra. 4. Mitos teogónicos : relatan el origen de los dioses Por ejemplo, Atenea surge armada de la cabeza de Zeus. 5. Mitos antropogónicos : narran la aparición del ser humano, quien puede ser creado a partir de cualquier materia, viva (un árbol, un animal) o inerte (polvo, lodo, arcilla, etc.). Los dioses le enseñan a vivir sobre la tierra. Normalmente están vinculados a los mitos cosmogónicos. 6. Mitos etiológicos : explican el origen de los seres, las cosas, las técnicas y las instituciones. 7. Mitos morales : explican la existencia del bien y d

Prosetecnisa Zuazo, último viaje antes del parón – Costa del Sol Málaga Prosetecnisa Zuazo, último viaje antes del parón 2014-2015, Balonmano Zuazo Doble enfrentamiento con equipos vascos, eso es lo que le queda al equipo de Diego Carrasco antes de llegar al parón liguero. El primero llegará este sábado en Barakaldo a las 19:00 horas, el Clínicas Rincón Málaga Costa del Sol visitará el Municipal de Lasaserre con la intención de ser el primer equipo que vence a domicilio en esta pista. El conjunto vizcaíno marcha quinto clasificado con 10 puntos en la zona alta de la tabla, 5 victorias y 3 derrotas son su marca (invicto en casa). El encuentro no será sencillo, pero ya en A Guarda el equipo se mostró competitivo en A Sangriña, para posteriormente, en el siguiente viaje a León, conseguir una victoria de importancia vital. Es por eso que el equipo viaja a Barakaldo consciente de la dificultad pero sabedor de que si se compite, se pueden tener opciones. Diego Carrasco contará para la ocasión con el equipo al completo, con la única baja de Bea Puertas que sigue con su proceso de recuperación. El partido podrá seguirse de forma íntegra en Metroradio en el 91.2 FM para Málaga. Apenas 3 días después del enfrentamiento con el Prosetecnisa Zuazo, las guerreras malagueñas reciben en casa al actual campeón, el Bera Bera de San Sebastian, en jornada entre semana adelantada, la última antes del parón por selecciones, este encuentro se disputará el próximo miércoles 19 a las 21:30 en la ciudad deportiva de Carranque. En estos dos últimos encuentros del año las de Diego Carrasco buscarán sorprender y sacar puntos cara a una mayor tranquilidad en la tabla clasificatoria, aunque los partidos en los que verdaderamente se batirán el c

Ahora Ulapa | Periódico AM | Noticias de Hidalgo, México Ahora Ulapa Desde enero pasado se alertó que ante la política de "prueba-error" implementada por el gobierno de la República, que encabeza el presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador, se generó resquemor social ante la indicación de establecer una Guardia Nacional cuya fase de experimentación arrojara consecuencias fatales. Este espacio expuso entonces que, la muerte y criminalización de dos hermanos a merced de soldados en la comunidad El Aserradero en Cuautepec, hechos que generaron la reacción de los lugareños, sentaba mal precedente de lo que podría resultar con una corporación de heterogénea y dudosa conformación. Algo similar ocurrió ahora en Ulapa, municipio de Tetepango, donde un joven de 22 años murió en el fuego cruzado, alcanzado por las balas que presuntamente dispararon los soldados, quienes justifican que se encontraban en un operativo contra traficantes de hidrocarburo, de los cuales no hay evidencia. Por ambos casos fueron iniciadas quejas de oficio ante la Comisión de Derechos Humanos del Estado de Hidalgo, remitidas a su similar nacional al tratarse de autoridades federales, así como carpetas de investigación en Ministerios Públicos de la Procuraduría General de Justicia para deslindar responsabilidades. El procurador de Hidalgo, Raúl Arroyo González dio a conocer el viernes pasado en Radio Fórmula que busca determinar el origen de la bala que quitó la vida al joven que transitaba por Ulapa. Hasta ese momento se habían presentado 24 militares a rendir su declaración, a quienes les retuvieron sus armas. Parece redundante decir que las fuerzas castrenses no saben conducirse frente a la población civil. Sin embargo, para los integrantes de la autonombrada Cuarta Transformación no es así, toda vez que pese al discurso que intentan radicar en el imaginario colectivo, su Guardia Nacional tendrá genética militar. En los casos mencionados la población protestó y retuvo a los militares para luego ent

LABORAL En este año se han hecho 119.106 traslados desde las AFP a Colpensiones La reciente apuesta de invitar, por medio de las redes sociales, a los cotizantes a que cambien de régimen de pensión, además de los subsidios que se entrega por este modelo, al parecer están dando resultados. Así lo demuestran las cifras de trasferencias entregadas por Colpensiones en las que se observa que los cambios del Régimen de Ahorro Individual (Rais) al Régimen de Prima Media (RPM) llegaron a 119.106 en lo que va del año, mientras que desde RPM a Rais se completaron 9.800 con cifras a septiembre. Se debe recordar que previamente, en agosto, la Asociación Colombiana de Fondos de Pensiones y Cesantías (Asofondos) dio a conocer que se habían dado 75.000 traspasos de Rais a RPM y 6.400 de RPM a Rais; lo que evidencia el alza en los últimos meses. Pero ¿cuál es la razón para que se hayan dado estos movimientos? Jorge Llano, director de Estudios Económicos de Asofondos, explicó que "se ha visto un incremento de traslados de personas que no recibieron la doble asesoría, jóvenes que se pasaron sin esta herramienta y que están trasladándose muchas veces en detrimento de su propio bienestar". No obstante, para el experto, lo positivo que viene para el país es que "a partir de octubre la doble asesoría es obligatoria para todos los afiliados y ahí se estará evidenciando un decisión de traslado mucho más informada para ese grupo de afiliados". "No es culpa de la gente, sino de la estructura del sistema que permite tener ese tipo de arbitrajes sobre el riesgo moral, donde los cambios son 12 veces más a Colpensiones". "Se ha visto un incremento de traslados de personas que no recibieron la doble asesoría y que se cambian m

El gobierno recomendó no viajar a Epuyén y a la crisis sanitaria se suma la económica | Tiempo Argentino | Tiempo Argentino Las nueve muertes que ya provocó el brote de Hantavirus en la localidad chubutense de Epuyén constituyen el núcleo de una tragedia humana cuyas derivaciones dependerán en gran medida de la eficacia diagnóstica y de contención que pueda desplegar las autoridades sanitarias, pero también el epicentro de una crisis que amenaza a todos los pobladores de la llamada "comarca andina" del paralelo 42, que también integran las localidades de El Hoyo, Lago Puelo o El Maitén. Con sentido profiláctico, es cierto, las voces oficiales no hacen sino agravar el panorama. Adolfo Rubinstein, ex ministro y hoy secretario de Salud de la Nación, aseguró que "no recomendaría viajar a Epuyén y sus alrededores en este momento". Y un artículo de la agencia de noticias Télam (escrito por un periodista de Clarín) lo califica de "pueblo fantasma". Los rostros cubiertos por barbijos son la postal de Epuyén. Tony Reato, el intendente, explicó que se decidió que lo usen todos los empleados municipales que atienden al público. En la comuna repiten que "se puede ingresar y salir de la localidad sin problemas", que las actividades al aire libre "se realizan normalmente", y que los barbijos son "para cuidarlos y cuidarnos". En una villa que vive del turismo, Reato es tajante: "Estamos peor que en el peor mes del año". Lo efectos de la crisis sanitaria se extienden a toda la comarca andina. "El viernes nos reunimos con el ministro de la Producción. Está claro que económicamente el impacto será enorme", se lamenta Gustavo Flak, dueño de la hostería Las Pataguas, en el límite entre Epuyén y El Hoyo, y concejal de esta última localidad. "Esto se suma a lo que vienen sufriendo las economías regionales, con los tarifazos y el aumento de los combustibles. Y si bien no había una tremenda cantidad de reservas, las que había se cayeron en efecto dominó. El verano es vital para la comarca andina, miles de familias dependen de esta época para tirar todo el año". Flak enumera no sólo a los microempresarios turísticos, sino a las personas que realizan trabajos en esas cabañas, hosterías y campings, los productores de fruta fina que destinan parte de su cosecha al menudeo estival, paisanos que tienen una tropilla y se hacen de una moneda con cabalgatas, etc. "Ahora todo esto se fue de las manos", grafica. Para todos ellos, la suspensión de las fiestas (la de la Fruta Fina, en El Hoyo, la del Artesano, en Epuyén, y la del Tren a Vapor, en El Maitén) terminó de pintar el panorama. En Lago Puelo habían anunciado que la Fiesta del Bosque (del 16 al 18 de febrero) seguía en pie, pero también se suspendió. "Con las reservas caídas, todo esto va a pegar en el comercio y complica la actividad de los pequeños productores de la zona, que hacen conservas,dulces, licores, en una época en que coinciden la cosecha y la afluencia turística", explica Pol Huisman, que elabora dulces en la chacra El Monje, y pide que el gobierno provincial disponga las medidas que permitan que la temporada no se pierda. Mientras tanto, funcionarios y técnicos de Salud y de la cartera sanitaria provincial evalúan día a día la evolución del brote, que comenzó en una fiesta de 15 el día 3 de noviembre, a la que asistió el llamado "caso índice", un hombre que ya había acudido al hospital de Epuyén con los síntomas de la enfermedad, pero fue devuelto dos veces a su casa con un diagnóstico de gripe. De la sala de situación participan Miriam Burgos, subsecretaria de Prevención y Control de Enfermedades Comunicables e Inmunoprevenibles, y Patricia Angeleri, directora nacional de Epidemiología. El objetivo primordial es contener el brote, detectando y previniendo nuevos casos, y estudiando cómo fueron los contactos y cuáles las vías de transmisión, q

El tema de Género en el Proyecto de la constitución cubana. Valoración del Grupo ECO MUJER DE PINAR DEL RÍO. | EcoMujer e.V. - Frauen und Umwelt Startseite→Español→El tema de Género en el Proyecto de la constitución cubana. Valoración del Grupo ECO MUJER DE PINAR DEL RÍO. ← Soli Cuba e.V. und EcoMujer e.V. im Cafe Eden auf Weltreise nach Kuba Der Genderaspekt im cubanischen Verfassungsentwurf. Auswertung der Gruppe EcoMujer in Pinar del Rio → Autores: Dra.C. Rosa Hernández Acosta | MsC. Silvia Armas Hernández | MsC. Reina María Rodríguez García La característica principal del Modelo Cuba es que constituye a la población como constituyente, esto quiere decir que todo el proceso de aprobación se realiza presentando el Proyecto de Constitución a la consulta popular para su aprobación o no por el pueblo. Desde que comenzó el proceso se realizan las asambleas a nivel de Centros de trabajo, los barrios, los centros de estudio y otras entidades garantizando que todos los ciudadanos cubanos puedan dar sus opiniones, de forma libre y soberana. En relación a los derechos individuales nuestro grupo de ECO-MUJER valora la importancia de que en el proyecto se atiende la equidad de género ya que en el ARTÍCULO 40. Se plantea que todas las personas son iguales ante la ley, están sujetas a iguales deberes, reciben la misma protección y trato de las autoridades y gozan de los mismos derechos, libertades y oportunidades, sin ninguna discriminación por razones de sexo, género, orientación sexual, identidad de género, origen étnico, color de la piel, creencia religiosa, discapacidad, origen nacional o cualquier otra distinción lesiva a la dignidad humana. Resulta interesante el tratamiento que se hace en el proyecto de constitución a los Derechos Individuales, en especial nos referimos a un problema no resuelto de forma total sobre las mujeres y que se incluye en el ARTÍCULO 45. que plantea. La mujer y el hombre gozan de iguales derechos y responsabilidades en lo económico, político, cultural, social y familiar. Resulta interesante reconocer que hemos crecido de forma significativa en el número de mujeres con cargos como dirigentes en las diferentes categorías de dirección con muy buena representación en el Consejo de Estado y de Ministro. 148. El Estado garantiza que se ofrezcan a ambos las mismas oportunidades y posibilidades. 149. El Estado propicia la plena participación de la mujer en el desarrollo del país y la protege ante cualquier tipo de violencia. Mu

(Foto: captura Youtube/Senadores PRD) febrero 22, 2017 4:57 pm El secretario de Seguridad Nacional de Estados Unidos, John Kelly, y el secretario de Estado, Rex Tillerson, no son bienvenidos ante el ambiente de amenazas y hostilidad que mantiene su gobierno hacia México, señaló Miguel Barbosa Huerta, coordinador del grupo parlamentario del PRD. En entrevista con medios, el senador dijo que es un error de la diplomacia mexicana traerlos luego de que el presidente Donald Trump firmó sus órdenes ejecutivas contra migrantes. "Para nosotros no son bienvenidos, lo digo de manera muy clara y espero la sensibilidad del Presidente de la República de no tener reuniones con ellos", agregó.

El centro de interpretación y la mejora de la Casa de los Verdú llenan el plan del Palmeral de Orihuela - Alicanteplaza La firma de arquitectura GYStudio se encarga del proyecto El centro de interpretación y la mejora de la Casa de los Verdú llenan el plan del Palmeral de Orihuela ORIHUELA. El Palmeral de San Antón, en Orihuela tiene en cola varios proyectos para poner en valor su protección y el entorno natural y patrimonial que engloba en su término. El Ayuntamiento quiere recuperar los valores culturales, ambientales y paisajísticos del entorno natural. Entre esos planes, cabe restaurar el patrimonio y generar rutas en torno al Palmeral para aumentar su valor para el ocio y el turismo. El Consistorio contará con la empresa GyStudio y el arquitecto Javier Gamayo para elaborar el proyecto, que verá la luz en verano con fondos del Consistorio y de los Fondos Europeos de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER). Se acaban de concretar varias de esas acciones, entre las que destacan el plan para crear el centro de interpretación del Palmeral de Orihuela y la restauración, entre otras obras, de la Casa de los Verdú, para dotarla de un nuevo uso didáctico. En palabras de Tamayo, sería la transformación parcial del Palmeral, estableciendo las bases y actuaciones futuras" del proyecto. Para lograr ese objetivo principal, se han establecido dos objetivos específicos, con actuaciones concretas para alcanzarlos. En primer lugar, los creadores del proyecto quieren lograr la integración del Palmeral en el entorno y potenciarlo como reclamo cultural y de ocio para Orihuela. Lo quieren conseguir a través de la adquisición de bienes inmuebles y de crear recorridos peatonales y ciclistas entre la ciudad y la huerta. En este bloque estaría integrada la creación del centro de interpretación del Palmeral. El otro bloque de trabajo se centrará en recuperar los elementos con valor patrimonial. El equipo de arquitectos restaurarán la Casa de los Verdú, así como el acueducto del Canal de la Escorrata. Los elementos que conforman la red hidráulica, como pozos, balsas de riego, azarbes, acequias y los baños de San Antón. El 'muro de mampostería y el vallado de caña tradicional también estará presente entre las mejoras del enclave. La protección del Palmeral de San Antón ya tiene las bases para el próximo plan director y de gestión para acordar, a largo plazo, la gestión fitosanitaria del Palmeral de Orihuela y para fijar sus criterios de sostenibilidad ambiental, social y económica de forma íntegra. El Ayuntamiento de Orihuela ha licitó la redacción de este plan, por 48.000 euros, y esperaba las ofertas de empresas para que establezcan las bases para las futuras bases del cuidado de este conjunto natural oriolano. El anuncio de la realización del plan director había sido una constante a lo largo del presente mandato. Asimismo, las bases para un plan integral para el cuidado de este enclave ha sido una reivindicación de la oposición oriolana y de asociaciones medioambientales. La actuación integral pretende repercutir en todos los elementos etnológicos y patrimoniales, y en la integración del Palmeral en la ciudad. El proyecto verá a luz en verano, pe

El tema fue producido por Dj Luian, Yomo Pauta y Jetty. "Me encanta trabajar con artistas de la nueva generación porque están con esa hambre de hacer música de verdad. Tan pronto le mostramos el tema a Lunay, lo grabó rápido y creo que logramos la combinación perfecta. Sin lugar a duda, escogimos el tema correcto para Lunay y estamos super felices con el resultado. Esto será un super palo" expresó PACHO EL ANTIFEKA. El video de «TU RECUERDO» fue dirigido por Gus Camacho y producido por Mastermind Entertainment. Grabado en la ciudad de Miami, Florida, en la que se muestra la historia de amor de una pareja que viven muchos momentos felices juntos, pero al final todo se convierte en un solo recuerdo.

Gurudev Siddha Peeth, abril de 2006— el verano en todo su esplendor. El brillo dorado del sol naciente hacía que todo resplandeciera. Yo iba al comedor de Annapurna para desayunar. Los pájaros gorjeaban. Los altos árboles seducían. La suave brisa se mecía en la atmósfera llena de shakti. Al tomar la curva del sendero de Ganesha, vi a Gurumayi caminando en mi dirección. Los rayos dorados del sol la inundaban y ella parecía un cúmulo de radiante luz azafrán. Gurumayi caminaba tan ligera que de inmediato estuvimos una frente a otra. Las dos sonreímos, y yo junté las manos en namasté, ofreciéndole mi pranam. Gurumayi dijo en hindi: “Mmm, ¡llevas un kaftán!” Un ka

"Sí funcionan las Yalitzas", dice Delegado de AMLO en Veracruz; a Cuarón lo cuidó una, añade (video) | Zona Franca Manuel Huerta Ladrón Guevara, Delegado del Gobierno Federal en Veracruz, defendió la nueva forma de operación del programa de estancias infantiles durante la actual administración, en la que se establece que ahora serán los mismos padres de familia quienes recibirán de manera directa los apoyos para el cuidado de los menores, con el objetivo de que seleccionen entre una estancia infantil u otra persona. Como ejemplo para la segunda opción, recordó que el cineasta mexicano Alfonso Cuarón fue cuidado por "una muchacha" en su infancia, acontecimiento que se vio reflejado en Roma, película recientemente galardonada con tres estatuillas en la entrega de los premios Óscar, celebrada el pasado 24 de febrero en el Teatro Dolby de Los Ángeles. Ciudad de México, (SinEmbargo). Manuel Huerta Ladrón Guevara, Delegado del Gobierno Federal en Veracruz, aseguró que la entrega de recursos a las madres beneficiarias del programa de estancias infantiles permitirá que ellas puedan elegir a un familiar o a otra persona para que cuide a sus hijos, como "Yalitzas", en referencia a la protagonista de Roma, película de Alfonso Cuarón. "Van a entregar recursos para abrir el apoyo a la gente en otras zonas para encontrar mecanismos. Acuérdense que puede ser una estancia o ellos pueden optar por su familiar o una persona así tipo (Alfonso) Cuarón, que lo cuidó una muchacha y miren, sacó hasta un premio Óscar, para que vean que sí funcionan las Yalitzas", dijo en entrevista con medios nacionales este miércoles. El también ex Diputado federal por el Partido del Trabajo (PT) defendió la nueva forma de operación de dicho programa durante la actual administración, en la que se establece que ahora serán los mismos padres de familia quienes recibirán de manera directa los apoyos para el cuidado de los menores, con el objetivo de que seleccionen entre una estancia infantil u otra persona. — Fer Betancourt (@DivinoTormento9) March 6, 2019 Como ejemplo para la segunda opción, recordó que el cineasta mexicano Alfonso Cuarón fue cuidado por "una muchacha" en su infancia, acontecimiento que se vio reflejado en la cinta recientemente galardonada con tres estatuillas en la entrega de los premios Óscar, celebrada el pasado 24 de febrero en el Teatro Dolby de Los Ángeles, donde participa la actriz Yalitza Aparicio. Asimismo, Ladrón de Guevara informó que a partir de la próxima semana arrancará la entrega de tarjetas a los beneficiarios del programa de estancias infantiles. "Determinar su futuro a partir de lo que el DIF, municipios y lo que los padres de familia decidan, si van a continuar estas estancias o no", comentó respecto a lo que viene para los inmuebles que desempeñan las funciones de cuidado para menores. Por otra parte, el funcionario federal no descartó que puedan quedar recursos para abrir el apoyo de este proyecto la gente en otras zonas del país. Insultos a Yalitza El pasado 15 de febrero, el actor Sergio Goyri llamó "pinche india" a la actriz Yalitza Aparicio y demeritó su actuación en la película Roma, según un video grabado por la empresaria Lupita Arriola. "Que metan a nominar a una pinche india que dice: 'sí señora, no señora', y que la metan a una terna a la mejor actriz del Óscar…", dice Goyri a los comensales. Y recalcó que "estaba comentando otro tipo de cosas y al calor de la discusión salió eso". Por otra parte Alejandro Murat, Gobernador del estado de Oaxaca, compartió un mensaje a través de Twitter en el que recalca que "es indignante e inaceptable que se hagan comentarios racistas hacia una mujer con raíces indígenas". Aparicio estuvo nominada como Mejor Actriz en los premios Óscar, mientras Roma fue considerada en 10 de las categorías, entre las que destaca Mejor Película, hecho inédito para una cinta mexicana. Yalitza, blanco de críticas Yalitza Aparicio ha sido objeto de una serie de críticas tanto por su aspecto como por su actuación en la película de Cuarón. Luego del trascendido, varias actrices rechazaron ser parte de la lista que se difundió en redes sociales. Ninguna, sin embargo, negó que se hubiera pedido vetar a la actriz indígena oaxaqueña nominada al Óscar. Por su parte, la actriz de teatro y cine, Regina Orozco – ganadora del Ariel por la cinta Profundo Carmesí en 1996– pidió que los medios sacaran su nombre de las notas que la relacionaran con el grupo, pues no va con lo que piensa de la joven de 25 años. El llamado de Yalitza En entrevista con SinEmbargo, la actriz mexicana señaló que la discriminación hacia los Pueblos Originarios debe desaparecer. "Deberíamos voltear a verlas [a las comunidades indígenas], no solamente hablar o decir, sino realmente actuar porque como dicen: 'del dicho al hecho hay mucho trecho' y es mucho de lo que pasa con nosotros. Hablamos y comentamos sobre ellos, pero no hay alguna acción que realicemos realmente para ayudarlos". El 71.9 por ciento de la población indígena en México, conformada por 8.3 millones de personas, vivía en niveles altos de pobreza en 2016, de acuerdo con la medición del Consejo Nacional de Evaluación de la Política de Desarrollo Social (Coneval), misma que reportó en un informe de agosto de 2018. De ese total, 3.2 millones de indígenas ni siquiera contaban con la capacidad económica para adquirir la canasta básica.

Ensayo Pessoa: [Reis criticando a Caeiro - I] [Reis criticando a Caeiro - I] P or cierto que la obra tiene defectos, y defectos que, siendo para mí bien patentes, no empañan, salvo en lo poco que la empañan, la brillantez de la obra. Rasgó Caeiro la niebla cristiana, que encubre la naturaleza y las emociones que nacen de ella. Pero ni rasgó enteramente esa niebla, ni del todo la consiguió levantar delante de sus propios ojos. Ambas incompletitudes eran de esperar. Que no rasgase del todo esa niebla, era cierto de antemano, pues eso no podía ser obra de un hombre, sino de generaciones de hombres, que ni sólo una bastaría. Que no la apartase del todo frente a sus propios ojos también era de esperar; pues en su alma, como en la de todos nosotros, yacía, a pesar de la aspiración de objetivismo, el fermento subjetivista cristiano, que, sin que lo demos por tal, forma parte consubstancial de la esencia de nuestro ser espiritual. El más pagano de nosotros tiene que expresarse en un lenguaje cristiano, porque las palabras en sus relaciones entre sí y el sentido de cada una aisladamente (de por sí) están cristianizadas. Como ya no hablamos griego, tampoco pensamos griego. Por eso en la obra de Caeiro aparecen algunos elementos que, aunque no escondan su esencia, todavía la contradicen. Enumeraré esos elementos. Para enumerar primero, escogeré aquel que es el más evidente de todos: la forma poética adoptada, que es, para mí, inadmisible. Sé bien que esa forma tiene un ritmo propio, que ni se confunde con el ritmo de los versos libres de Whitman, ni con el de los versos libres de los franceses modernos. Ese ritmo, sin embargo, nace, en verdad, de la incompetencia de colocar el pensamiento dentro de moldes estables; facilita demasiado, para que lo podamos contar como valor. El objetivista debe, encima de todo, hacer de sus poemas objetos, con contornos definidos, procurando que obedezcan a leyes exteriores a sí mismos, como la piedra, cuando cae, obedece a la gravedad, que, siendo parte de la «lógica» de su movimiento, no es parte de su personalidad material, considerada exclusivamente como tal. Apuntaré, enseguida, como defecto –más grave para mí, aunque, bien lo sé, mucho menos grave para los otros– el baño tibio de emotividad cristiana en que algunos de los poemas están envueltos, la simbología cristista de la que algunos de ellos, incluso, se sirven. Planea sobre parte del lib

Marcelo Tinelli arrancó este 2022 con un nuevo formato que en un comienzo llamó la atención y le reportó números favorables, pero con la llegada de Gran Hermano a la televisión argentina, el conductor no logró remontar y ahora Ángel de Brito confirmó que dejará la pantalla de El Trece. El periodista abrió la cajita de preguntas en Instagram y respondió a la consulta sobre la salida de Tinelli del canal. «A ninguna de las dos partes les interesaba seguir», aseguró Ángel. Luego, el conductor de LAM dio detalles sobre cómo seguirá todo hasta fin de año. «Graba todo en noviembre y se va al Mundial. En el verano, Canta Conmigo Ahora lo conduce Manuel Wirtz, pero los fines de semana solamente», afirmó. Por último, De Brito reiteró: «Tinelli no estará más en El Trece». Marcelo Tinelli contó con quién va a ir al Mundial de Qatar Ahora que está soltero, Tinelli ocupa gran parte de su tiempo libre en compañía de sus hijos y amigos. Hoy, por ejemplo, almorzó con su hija Mica Tinelli y su amigo Felix Maillo. «Estoy muy feliz de ir al Mundial, de ir con algunos integrantes de mi familia y con amigos a disfrutar la fiesta máxima del fútbol.

Jueves 27 de Febrero del 2020 Staff Felicita administrador de la Ciudad a nombre del Alcalde a la Generación 2019 de la FCPYS Ciudad Juárez cuenta ya con otros 116 profesionistas que a partir de hoy contribuirán con su desempeño laboral en el crecimiento de nuestra comunidad, afirmó esta tarde el administrador de la Ciudad, José Rodolfo Martínez Ortega. Lo anterior al acudir en representación del Presidente Municipal Armando Cabada Alvídrez a la graduación de los ya profesionistas Generación 2019, de la Facultad de Ciencias Políticas y Sociales de la Universidad Autónoma de Chihuahua, Campus Juárez. Al iniciar su intervención, el administrador pidió un fuerte aplauso para honrar a las familias que siempre los apoyaron hasta alcanzar su meta. Martínez Ortega destacó el papel de la UACH que durante décadas ha sido formadora de generaciones de hombres y mujeres comprometidos con su profesión, enalteciendo el nombre de la máxima casa de estudios del estado a nivel nacional e internacional. Es importante seguirse preparando porque esa es la clave para enfrentar los cambios, para ser ciudadanos libres y empoderados que puedan contribuir en la sociedad, indicó. Les recordó que en el diccionario siempre la palabra disciplina viene antes que la de éxito, por eso los invitó a que no se rindan porque les espera una larga vida. En total, fueron 96 alumnos de licenciatura en las carreras de Ciencias de la Comunicación, Administración y Relaciones Internacionales, así como 20 de maestría en Administración Pública, Administración y Comunicación, quienes con la conclusión de sus estudios se comprometen también para aportar con los conocimientos adquiridos a mejorar su entorno, destacó. El discurso en representación de la generación correspondió a Sheira Sugey Hernández Candelario, quién agradeció a las familias de los estudiantes, a los profesores y los invito a ser factores de cambio en los nuevos retos que habrán de enfrentar en la vida profesional. Estuvieron en el presidium Abraham Paniagua Vázquez, director de la Facultad de Ciencias Políticas y Sociales, de la Universidad Autónoma de Chihuahua campus Juárez; el Capitán Primero Quimoteo Vázquez Trejo, en representación del Gener

El furor por los Mercados gourmet Imitando el modelo de otros grandes mercados gourmet del mundo, también en Buenos Aires han abierto algunos y van por más. Después del Mercat Villa Crespo y el Mercado de los Carruajes, ahora abrirán Mercat Caballito, a metros de Acoyte y Rivadavia. El Mercado de los Carruajes funciona en Leandro N. Alem 452, ocupa el edificio de la antigua cochera de los carruajes presidenciales, refuncionalizada para albergar esta propuesta de Mercado Gourmet, puestos de comidas, venta de alimentos, locales comerciales y terraza para eventos. Mercat Villa Crespo, situado en Thames 547, fue inaugurado en marzo de 2021. Ocupa un edificio donde antiguamente funcionaba una fábrica de carteras. Es un mercado donde conviven propuestas gourmet, productos naturales, degustaciones, charlas, eventos y entretenimiento. Este nuevo emprendimiento, Mercat Caballito, estará a una cuadra de Acoyte y Rivadavia, en el nuevo segundo piso del Shopping Caballito y tendrá algunas diferencias con respecto a los otros dos mercados gourmet inaugurados en marzo de 2021. Ofrecerá dos propuestas comerciales diferentes: Por un lado, bares, restaurantes, barras y cafeterías cuyos platos se podrán consumir in situ y por delivery o take away. El mercado tendrá una superficie total de 1.200 m2 y contará con un espacio de 270 metros de góndolas bajas, de productos orgánicos, que terminarán en una línea de cajas y además tendrá 250 lugares para sentarse. Esta segunda planta se sumó al shopping tras la incorporación de un edificio sobre la calle Rosario que se unió a un depósito. El Mercat será una importante propuesta culinaria del centro comercial, que solo contaba con un McDonald's. Se estima que será inaugurado en diciembre próximo y entre los locales que tendrán allí su espacio podemos citar: Kyopo, un restaurante de comida coreana; Pizzería Nuvola; Avocado Republic y otros, aún no confirmados. También se repiten algunos emprendimientos que están en el Mercat Villa Crespo como el restaurante y charcutería Lado A, la panadería judía Moisha Bakery y La casa de Tafí, especializado en empanadas. Entre las novedades, habrá una arrocería especializada en risottos. Además habrá una barra de tragos y vinos y una cafetería y pastelería, aún sin definir. El mercado orgánico estará a cargo de Argentbio Market, una firma que reúne pequeños productores de todo el país. Comercializarán desde productos a granel hasta frescos como frutas y verduras agroecológicas. La propuesta busca ser una instancia superadora del supermercado (donde los alimentos son industriales) y de la dietética (donde la oferta es mucho menor en cantidad y variedad). "Tampoco tenemos nada que ver con un patio de comidas. Vamos a tener cena: abriremos hasta las 24 en la semana y sábados y domingos hasta las 3 AM. Y queremos incentivar la compra nocturna, que se pueda ir al mercado hasta la medianoche como en los Estados Unidos", detalla Marcelo Pirogovsky, uno de los socios del proyecto y fundador del Mercat Villa Crespo. Esto es posible porque el Mercat tendrá una entrada independiente del centro comercial por la calle Rosario. Teniendo en cuenta el suceso de Mercat Vill

Brendon Todd lidera en Cromwell, Dustin Johnson acecha | Asociación de Voluntarios de Golf - AVG Entre las sombras del recorrido de Cromwell ha surgido un competidor que llevaba algún tiempo peleado con sus palos. Como quien espera su momento, Dustin Johnson, descerrajó ayer un 61 para reivindicar su golf. Mackenzie Hughes inició las hostilidades con un 60 en la jornada de inicio del Travelers Championship. Luego Phil Mickelson hizo un deslumbrante 63 el viernes, para adquirir una ventaja de un golpe antes del fin de semana. Nadie hablaba de Dustin Johnson después de dos jornadas con 69-64 situado en el vigésimo puesto de la competición a seis golpes de Mickelson. Tras fallar el corte en el Charles Schwab Challenge, terminó décimo séptimo la semana pasada en el RBC Heritage. Estaba precalentando. Ayer el que fuera número uno del mundo y ganador del US Open de 2016 se dio un festín de juego. Alcanzó 12 de las 14 calles y 16 de los 18 greens en regulación. Hizo nueve birdies y ningún bogey. La vuelta más baja de su carrera, 61 golpes. «Siempre podría haber sido mejor», dijo Johnson después con una sonrisa. «Pero, hice un montón de buenos putts que entraron en el hoyo desde ese rango de entre dos y tres metros, probablemente emboqué cuatro, cinco o seis de ellos. Sí, hice algunos buenos putts. Estoy muy contento con la forma en que jugué». El 61 dejó a Johnson con 16 bajo par, a dos golpes del líder del torneo, Brendon Todd. Después de entregar dos tarjetas de 66-65, Todd también aprovechó las condiciones ideales, y un gran momento de putt, para también terminar una tercera ronda libre de bogeys, 9 bajo par, 61 golpes, que pudieron ser menos, si llega a embocar un putt asequible en el último de su vuelta. Empezará el domingo en 18 bajo par. Todd, de 34 años, natural de Pittsburgh, Pensilvania, puede presumir de dos victorias esta temporada ganó el Bermuda Championship junto al Mayakoba Golf Classic. No tiene el poder de estrella de Johnson o la fuerza desde el tee de salida, pero el antiguo alumno de la Universidad de Georgia está teniendo un año de ensueño. «Parece que desde el otoño, cada vez que tengo una bucle de dos o tres semanas seguida

Inicio / ¿Qué Es Un ICO? Adquiriendo los recursos de financiación de un proyecto determinado a través del internet con la garantía de revalorización de la inversión inicial de acuerdo a los movimientos de las mismas en el mercado de las criptomonedas. El proyecto en busca de financiación emite cierta cantidad de cripto activos o tokens sobre una plataforma o blockchain existente como bitcoins y lo entrega los inversores a cambio de criptomonedas y en algunos casos dinero fiduciario. Se logra con la automatización a través de internet con contratos inteligentes de acuerdo a los requerimientos del dueño del ICO con altos estándares de seguridad. Características De Un ICO Sus características principales como fuente de financiación de proyectos pueden enumerarse así: Globalización: Por ser transadas a través de internet no existe limitante para que cualquier persona en cualquier lugar del mundo participe, dependiendo de ciertas regiones donde se prohíbe su aplicación. Poca Regulación: Puede ser ambivalente existen en la actualidad muy poca regulación nivel mundial, por lo que el capital de financiación y tenedores de ICOs no cuentan con ningún tipo de protección jurídica. Prohibidos actualmente en china y Sur Corea y regulados en Estados Unidos por la ley de seguros. Inversión Ilimitada: Los inversores en este tipo de financiación pueden realizar las compras sin importar que sean pequeñas o grandes cantidades de tokens ofertados.- Limitado solo por las condiciones que los dueños impongan. Facilidad: Durante la ICO los inversionistas pueden pactar directamente sobre la plataforma o blockchain sin la necesidad de un intermediario, brokers o corredor de bolsa. Diferencia Entre Una IPO Y Un ICO Los IPOs (Initial Public Offering) siglas en inglés u Oferta Pública Inicial es una venta por primera vez de acciones de una empresa al público en el mercado de capitales creando obligaciones en la financiación. Los ICOs (Initial Coin Offering) por su parte colocan un tokens o cripto activo, sin una obligación directa sobre el capital de financiación, representa capital accionario en la empresa o proyecto pero le permite al tenedor interactuar en la plataforma a ser lanzada. Modelos De Venta De ICOs O Tokens. Más que un modelo son mecanismo en la venta de ICOs veamos cuales son: ICO De Venta Limitada (Capped Sales): representa riesgos, se mantiene fija pero se transa en distintas criptomonedas, la ganancia depende de las fluctuaciones de estas.-fue exitoso en un comienzo, ese mercado era muy limitado y solo se hizo en dos criptomonedas.

CORONAVIRUS: 65 MUERTOS MÁS EN UN DÍA EN FLORIDA. EL GOBERNADOR ADVIERTE A LAS EMPRESAS QUE VIOLEN LAS RESTRICCIONES ‹ Negocios Magazine Miami, martes 23 de junio de 2020. A medida que los casos de coronavirus de Florida explotan, con 65 muertes en el último día, el gobernador Ron DeSantis presionó el martes a las empresas que violan las restricciones operativas, diciendo que recibirán una visita de las autoridades estatales y los comercios podrían perder la licencia para operar. "Si entras y es como un caos, como" Dance Party USA "y está lleno hasta los topes, eso se corta y eso no es solo un error inocente", dijo DeSantis durante una conferencia de prensa en el Centro Médico Regional de Orlando. "No hay tolerancia para eso. Simplemente suspenda la licencia y luego continuaremos ". La advertencia se produjo después de un aumento de un mes en las infecciones por COVID-19 y después de días en que el gobernador restó importancia a los casos en aumento, diciendo que la mayoría están ocurriendo entre personas más jóvenes sin complicaciones graves. El Departamento de Salud Pública agregó 3.286 casos nuevos de coronavirus el martes por la mañana, elevando el total d

Fresno de Torote-Serracines Una escapada a Fresno de Torote Serracines se ha convertido en un auténtico pueblo, a cuyo alrededor se han ido levantando con el paso del tiempo nuevas y tranquilas urbanizaciones. Lo que propiamente se denomina Fresno de Torote es, prácticamente, una localidad abandonada o, más acertadamente, una propiedad privada que perteneció hasta hace muy poco tiempo a dos familias aristocráticas, las de los marqueses de Quirós y los condes de Torrepalma. Sus habitantes eran empleados agrícolas o ganaderos de estos anacrónicos señores feudales del pasado siglo XX. Pero los antiguos privilegios de cuna se han ido extinguiendo y los otrora poderosos aristócratas han ido desapareciendo y, con ellos, el cuidado de sus propiedades. Así, Fresno de Torote amenaza ruina desde hace varios años y no sólo la ermita semiderruida (la de la Soledad) que nos recibe por la carretera que viene de Daganzo de Arriba, sino, lo que es más grave, su hermosa iglesia parroquial, que fue vendida recientemente al Obispado de Madrid para que alguien se hiciera cargo de su costosa reparación. De hecho, a principios de año comenzaron las obras en su interior, en cuyo transcurso se descubrió un sarcófago que guardaba los restos de Juan Hurtado de Mendoza y Luján, señor de Fresno de Torote, que vivió a caballo entre los siglos XV y XVI y era descendiente del marqués de Santillana. En el momento de redactar estas líneas, las obras de rehabilitación se han debido suspender al haber anidado en su torre una pareja de cernícalos primilla, especie protegida en peligro de extinción. Hay que recordar que toda esta zona es un enclave biológico protegido: una ZEPA (Zona de Especial Protección de Aves). Los pájaros acuden a ese auténtico oasis que supone para la meseta madrileña el río Torote, que discurre a escasos metros de la localidad, cuyas riberas se encuentran bien pobladas de fresnos, álamos y acacias. No resulta extraño poder observar en esta zona aguiluchos laguneros, avutardas, sisones, buitres (el buitre negro es aquí más numeroso que el buitre común), milanos, águilas, cigüeñas, grullas o garzas reales, así como otr

CUESTIÓN DE FORMA Y FONDO: PEQUEÑOS PERO NO INVISIBLES Y CARRETERAS SECUNDARIAS | El Blog de Enrique 'Fenrisolo' Cardoso ← HOMO HOMINI LUPUS: MIS EXPERIENCIAS EN UN COLEGIO MAYOR DE MADRID CREMATORIO, DE RAFAEL CHIRBES: APLASTAR O DEJARSE APLASTAR POR EL SISTEMA → La parrilla televisiva sufre desde hace años una saturación de programas baratos. Es comprensible. Hoy la televisión compite directamente con Internet, mientras las audiencias están cada vez más fragmentadas desde la irrupción de la TDT y de nuevos canales autonómicos. Hoy en día el éxito no depende tanto de tener mucha audiencia como de reducir costes. La nueva máxima es gastar poco, lo que ha llevado a, entre otras cosas, la degradación de los servicios informativos, la desaparición de buena parte del contenido para niños, la invasión de los programas sensacionalistas y la aparición de nuevos formatos. Muchas de estas nuevas formas de hacer televisión se engloban bajo el nombre de Docus y se centran en temas sociales. Yo evito a toda costa catalogarlos bajo un nuevo término que no es sino una reducción de otro mucho más enjundioso: Documentales. Los documentales de naturaleza de La 2, los de la II Guerra Mundial del Canal de Historia… todos esos programas de impecable factura e innegable valor divulgativo. Los Docus que hoy nos quieren endilgar sobre chonis de extrarradio y pisos en alquiler están en las antípodas del cine documental, y por tanto no se merecen compartir ni cuatro letras con ese noble género, el bueno de toda la vida. Dentro de los mal llamados Docus surgieron hace años unos programas que llamaré Cámara al Hombro, un formato de fácil producción, consistente en enseñar las cosas de un vistazo, casi con los ojos de un espontáneo que visita un lugar, conoce a sus gentes y se mete hasta en la cocina. Un espontáneo que no quiere ir más allá, que se queda en la anécdota graciosa e impactante. Empezaron con Callejeros, mostrándonos los rincones más marginales y más lujosos de España con un ratio de 9:1 respectivamente, esto es, nueve barrios asquerosos por uno exclusivo a más no poder. Un televidente distraído podría pensar que vivimos en Guinea Ecuatorial, donde la clase media es una entelequia. Cuando los intrépidos reporteros del programa se percataron de que ya no quedaba más mierda española por mostrar a sus productores se les encendió la bombilla y decidieron copiar el formato de '(Gentilicio en plural) por el mundo' para pasar a mostrarnos la mierda del resto del planeta. Todo intercalado, otra vez, con lo más alto de la sociedad, a lo que supuestamente debemos aspirar el ejército de mataos' hartos de ver anuncios de Rolex en las revistas. Callejeros Viajeros es un programa dinámico, en el que ni siquiera se pierde el tiempo en presentar a los emigrantes españoles que hacen la vez de guías turísticos (sospecho que de esta forma pretenden evitar una denuncia por plagio de formato, o es que directamente son así de lanzados). Está lleno de escenas cortas, cortísimas, y músicas estridentes entre frase y frase. Planos imposibles, mucho follón en las calles, la ciudad en llamas. Callejeros Viajeros es, en suma, un videoclip de reggaetón. Mal apañado, pero videoclip al fin y al cabo. Cuánto daño ha hecho Callejeros a la televisión en España. A raíz de este programa de la Cuatro el resto de cadenas irrumpieron con espacios similares. Algunos, como Cámara Abierta de TVE, se centran en aspectos sociales de actualidad y no tanta actualidad. Otros siguen la senda de Expañoles por el Mundo y compañía pero dentro de nuestras fronteras. Pienso en Carreteras Secundarias, de La Sexta, en el que uno de esos reporteros intrépidos visita un pueblo de nuestra geografía y enseña lo más variopinto del mismo. El formato se parece bastante al de Callejeros Viajeros: una sucesión de imágenes y sonidos revueltos. Dos protagonistas: el oriundo del lugar que enseña el bar de turno -o lo que sea- y el omnipresente reportero, quien a pesar de estar casi siempre detrás de la cámara se encarga de mantener un vínculo constante con los anfitriones. Un vínculo de condescendencia y valiente ignorancia. Carreteras Secundarias es un programa hecho por urbanitas sin poka idea del mundo rural y, peor aún, sin poko interés en el susodicho. Un tío que desde la ciudad llega a un pueblo y se apaña un reportaje sin más armas que su verborrea de baratillo y su sexto sentido para encontrar lo anecdótico, enmarcarlo y ponerle precio. La música que acompaña todo el minutado no podía ser más inapropiada. A-ha, Cindy Lauper y cualquier artista de radiofórmula ochentera. Da igual que en pantalla aparezcan unos abuelos jugando a la petanca, que por los altavoces va a sonar la selección más alegre de Kiss FM. Ya el título da una pista: Carreteras Secundarias, la música que amenizaba nuestros largos viajes por la piel de toro, las carreteras que, como una tela de araña, conectaban esos rincones de cachondeo y feliz subdesarrollo del territorio nacional con la gran ciudad, única luz entre tanta oscuridad. Y muchos pensarán; qué más da cómo se llame el programa, la música que empleen, o cómo monten las imágenes. Es un programa dinámico en el que con mucho salero muestran los pueblos más bonitos de España, sin más. Pues no me da igual. Como telespectador exigente que soy me fijo tanto en el contenido como en la envoltura, y estoy convencido de que a veces la forma es razón suficiente para invalidar el fondo. En Aragón Televisión encontramos el ejemplo bueno, aunque he de matizar que parte de una idea ligeramente distinta. 'Pequeños pero no Invisibles' nos muestra pequeños pueblos de Aragón. La mayoría son poblaciones desconocidas con apenas 150 habitantes la mayor parte del año. Pueblos mal comunicados que durante décadas se empobrecieron por la continua migración a las ciudades y que ahora vuelven a recibir la atención que se merecen -o eso quiero creer-, en parte gracias al turismo rural y a programas de esta naturaleza. En 'Pequeños pero no Invisibles' los protagonistas son la gente del pueblo, y no un ingenioso reportero con ganas de lucirse. A lo sumo, a través del canal de sonido ambiente asoma una voz femenina que humildemente pregunta ¿Cómo se llama? ¿A qué se dedica? En todos los programas suelen aparecer los mismos personajes: el alcalde, la camarera del único bar; la de la tienda; un profesor joven recientemente trasladado a la población; el matrimonio que, cansado de la vida en la ciudad, decide poner tierra de por medio y montarse una casa rural; toda una directora de la asociación de mujeres; algunos agricultores ya en retirada… En definitiva, la gente que uno se encuentra en cualquier pueblo pequeño, acompañada de personajes particulares que nos demuestran cómo no hace falta ser ni muy rico, ni muy pobre, ni muy notas para destacar en algo. El otro día en el reportaje sobre Carenas -Comarca de Calatayud- aparecía el pastor y escritor Andrés Nuño, alguien con cosas que decir, una de esas personas a las que se les echa en falta en una program

Proyecto: casa en la huerta de Valencia, de estudio Ramón Esteve | DissenyCV <Juan Carlos Iñesta, el último artesano del barrio de Obradors Yinsen , la magia de los Laus> Vivienda sostenible que camina entre el entorno urbano y el espacio natural. La Casa en la Huerta, proyecto de Ramón Esteve Estudio actualmente en construcción, se sitúa en la localidad próxima a Valencia de Alboraya, en la zona fronteriza entre la retícula urbana y una gran extensión de huerta de chufa y hortalizas. Se trata de una casa entre medianeras situada en la esquina de una manzana residencial, por lo que goza de la comodidad de las viviendas urbanas a la vez que cuenta con unas amplias vistas sobre la huerta que se desdibujan en el horizonte. Para resolver este proyecto se plantea desde el estudio una envolvente geométrica limpia, blanca y abstracta, a la que se le practica

Atrás dejamos la playa, la montaña, la piscina, los largos días de descanso y los despertares a las doce del mediodía. Ahora toca madrugar y afrontar un nuevo curso con energía y motivación. Tras unas largas vacaciones, es hora de afrontar la vuelta al cole y a la rutina que ello supone. La capacidad de adaptación de los adultos a las rutinas y nuevas situaciones es totalmente distinta a la que tienen los niños debido al bagaje de experiencias que nos preceden y que nos permite adaptarnos de una forma más suave y controlada. Antes de la vuelta al cole, adapta sus horarios Pautas para la adaptación infantil en la vuelta al cole La forma de ser del niño influye en su capacidad de adaptación cuando llega a un sitio nuevo, con niños nuevos y, además, donde sus padres no están para guiarle. Para ello existen algunas pautas que agilizan y suavizan este proceso que, en ocasiones, puede provocar estrés en los pequeños, e incluso en los padres. Adaptación infantil de los horarios: cambiar los hábitos horarios de los niños es una de las principales condiciones a tener en cuenta para una rápida adaptación al colegio. Acostumbrados a echarse a dormir más tarde y despertarse también tarde, se hace difícil reestructurar sus hábitos. Para ello, en los últimos días de vacaciones es aconsejable acostarles antes e irles haciendo madrugar cada día un poco más. Así el cambio no será tan brusco. Despedidas rápidas: lo mejor cuando dejamos a nuestros niños en el colegio es despedirnos rápidamente. Si alargamos este mal trago, querrán quedarse con nosotros y les producirá un sentimiento de estrés que tardarán en olvidar. Despedirse rápido desde el primer día hará qu

Isetta 300 - La Luneta, Autos Clásicos y Antiguos Revista número 44 de Horacio Ariosto Historia particular En el año 1978 un amigo, al que apodaban el loco Santos, me ofreció el auto, que le compré luego de, naturalmente, pelearle el precio. En lo que se refiere a la restauración, al no tener conocimientos, lo hice a mi manera, desmantelándolo totalmente. Las cubiertas las importé de Uruguay, los manchones los conseguí en San Isidro y los repuestos que me faltaban los fabriqué. El chapista pintó la carrocería de color cobre Azteca. Eso demuestra el poco conocimiento que en esa época tenía sobre restauración. Creo que logré lo que quería porque andaba perfecto. Lo he usado mucho, como aquella vez que fui a Punta Indio y Magdalena. En el año 1980 decidí venderlo y lo adquirió un Señor que había seguido de cerca su restauración. Al entregárselo estaba tan entusiasmado que no retiró ninguna papelería ni siquiera la cédula. Así fue que, durante 25 años, no supe nada de él. Un día, revisando papeles, encontré los del Isetta y para regularizar la situación me comuniqué con el dueño, invitándolo a hacer la transferencia. En la conversación no pude evitar preguntarle si todavía estaba en su poder. Me contestó que sí, que hacía 8 años que no lo usaba porque se le había cortado el cable del embrague. Le propuse comprárselo, me contestó que más que venderlo quería cambiarlo por un ciclomotor. Me puse en campaña, conseguí uno e hicimos el cambio. Así que al día siguiente fui al registro del automotor y lo empadroné. Así encaré la segunda restauración. Costó mucho trabajo desarmar el tren delantero, porque estaba totalmente oxidado. Luego desarmé la caja y diferencial y el motor, reparándolos. Conseguí la bomba de ace

Crp: Ese Es El Valor De Laboratorio 💊 Científico-Práctico Medical Journal - 2019 Crp es una proteína que muestra inflamación en el cuerpo. Se puede determinar en la sangre. ¡lea toda la información importante sobre el valor de laboratorio! ¿Cuándo eliges CRP? valores de referencia CRP ¿Cuándo se incrementa el valor de CRP? CRP aumenta: ¿qué hacer? La proteína CRP es más detectable en la sangre en casos de inflamación en el cuerpo. Es parte del sistema inmune y ayuda a eliminar las células inmunes muertas y las sustancias extrañas del tejido inflamado. La concentración de CRP en la sangre también puede dar indicaciones de la naturaleza y curso de la inflamación. ¡Lea toda la información importante sobre el valor de laboratorio! La abreviatura CRP significa proteína C reactiva. La proteína pertenece a las llamadas proteínas de fase aguda del sistema inmune. Esto se conoce proteínas que son liberadas cada vez más en la sangre durante la inflamación aguda en el cuerpo y apoyan el sistema inmune de diferentes maneras. CRP se forma en el hígado. Si una infección se produce se une a las células muertas o inmune a las superficies exógenos, tales como bacterias y hongos, y los convierte en los fagocitos del sistema inmune está disponible. La CRP está aumentando a un inflamación reciente dentro de horas de 10 a 1000 veces y cae rápidamente de nuevo cuando la inflamación ha disminuido. Sin embargo, el valor no da ninguna indicación de en qué parte del cuerpo se produce la infección y / o inflamación. El valor de CRP se determina para las siguientes preguntas: ¿Hay una inflamación o una infección en el cuerpo? ¿Qué tan grave es la inflamación y cómo continúa? ¿Es un virus o una inflamación bacteriana? ¿Funciona la terapia antibiótica o antiinflamatoria? Por lo tanto, la CRP se determina para detectar la inflamación como una causa por ejemplo, con fiebre o el dolor en la mayoría de los casos. PCR estándar Valor Aglutinación de látex (semicuantitativa) Un nivel elevado en la sangre puede tener muchas causas y siempre debe ser médicamente aclarado. Un ligero aumento en el valor CRP se encuentra por ejemplo en infecciones virales, inflamación leve (infecciones del tracto urinario, infecciones gastrointestinales) o en el embarazo. Los niveles de CRP de medianos a altos indican una inflamación más severa o una infección bacteriana. Otras posibles causas incluyen: meningitis bacteriana (meningitis bacteriana) Complicaciones después de la cirugía (inflamación, tejido muerto) La determinación también se puede usar para la evaluación de riesgos en arteriosclerosis o diabetes mellitus. Cuando el nivel de PCR es elevado, siempre se debe aclarar la inflamación subyacente en el cuerpo. Dependiendo de los síntomas, se realizarán más investigaciones para determinar la causa. Entonces se puede iniciar una terapia adecuada. Por ejemplo, si se trata de una infección bacteriana, el médico generalmente le receta un antibiótico. En general, la concentración de CRP en la sangre luego rápidamente. La hepatitis B (también: inflamación del hígado tipo B) es una infección viral del hígado. Por lo general, se transmite a través de contactos sexuales. La enfermedad puede ser tanto aguda como crónica. Los posibles síntomas incluyen fatiga, ictericia o decoloración de la orina y las heces. A veces las personas infectadas no muestran ningún síntoma. El ginseng se recomienda para la debilidad, el cansancio y la disminución de la concentración. Además, según la medicina popular, el ginseng puede aumentar la potencia y aliviar la depresión. ¡Lea más sobre el efecto y la aplicación del ginseng aquí! Resumen del artículo Ginseng Poder curativ

La Fundació Joan Miró celebra 40 años | Barcelona Cultura El día 10 de junio, el espacio expositivo festeja esta significativa fecha con una jornada de puertas abiertas, oferta gastronómica, conciertos, proyecciones y actividades variadas La Fundació Miró cumple 40 años, y lo celebra con una gran fiesta. La celebración tendrá lugar el 10 de junio de 17 a 23h y consistirá en una jornada de puertas abiertas a la colección permanente y a las exposiciones Prophetia y En construcción 1973-75, que muestra imágenes de Joaquim Gomis de la construcción del edificio. En el auditorio de la fundación se proyectará el documental J. L. Sert. Un somni nòmada, que narra la vida del arquitecto del edificio desde su juventud en la ciudad condal hasta la llegada a la Universidad de Harvard. Fuera de la fundación, la fiesta también continuará. Habrá caravanas de cocina delante de la Fundación Miró y mesas instaladas en la calle, y se organizarán diversas actividades divididas en tres franjas: Tiempo para las familias, Tiempo para los Amigos y Tiempo para todos. Habrá acciones musicales, danza, talleres, visitas dinamizadas y un concierto de soul y rhythm'n'blues a cargo de Flamingo Tours. El día 10 de junio también será el punto de partida de otras iniciativas que quieren conmemorar el 40º aniversario de la fundación. Así, desde este día hasta el 31 de diciembre todas las personas nacidas en 1975 podrán recoger un pase anual gratuito. También se organizará un concurso fotográfico en las redes sociales, que consistirá en hacer un

Este país necesita psiquiatras, por Xavier Sardà ELISENDA ROSANAS (ACN) Este país necesita psiquiatras Es cierto que la situación no está para frivolidades, pero también que últimamente reivindicamos el derecho al humor y la heterodoxia contra censores y demandantes Sábado, 31/03/2018 - 21:01 Es cierto que la situación no está para frivolidades, pero también que últimamente reivindicamos el derecho al humor y la heterodoxia contra censores y demandantes. Quizá todo se vería distinto desde la consulta del psiquiatra. –Muy buenas. ¿Qué le ocurre? ¿Qué puedo hacer por usted? –Mire, doctor, en realidad… no sé cómo decírselo, pero es que no vengo por mí. –¿Un familiar?, ¿un amigo? –No, doctor, se trata de un país. Le traigo un país que no está del todo bien. Mejor dicho, está mal, doctor. ¿Puede atenderle? –Lo siento, pero los psiquiatras no atendemos a países. –Pero, entonces, ¿qué hacemos con mi país que tiene un trastorno de ansiedad generalizada? –Eso es cosa de… que sé yo… de políticos. No de psiquiatras. –Si el problema lo crean los políticos, ¿cómo lo van solucionar ellos? Trate al país como a un paciente, doctor. ¿Por qué si un paciente tiene fobia social lo puede tratar y a un país con la misma dolencia, no quiere brindarle una terapia adecuada? –Porque a un paciente le puedo medicar y a un país no. –Se habla con el servicio nacional de aguas y con la dosis pertinentemente multiplicada, ya está. –Me parece que el que necesita tratamiento es usted. –Le juro que el problema no es individual… Es el país el que sufre un clarísimo estrés postraumático. –Le digo que no tratamos países. No insista, por favor. –Vale, ¿y Parlamentos? ¿No trataría a todo un Parlamento? Al de mi país seguro que le falta litio y un anticonvulsivante. En serio, doctor. –Si no quiere nada más, le digo que yo solo trato a pacientes individualmente. –Doctor, formen un equipo y atiendan a mi país, se lo ruego. Esto viene de antiguo. Ya sabe usted que, si los padres observan que sus hijos tienden a enfrentarse a los compañeros ocasionando conflictos, tienen respuestas desafiantes e intentan incumplir las normas, deberían alertarse sobre la posibilidad de que su hijo deba ser tratado. –Claro, pero u

CabraNoticias | IX Fiesta del Aceite Fresco - CabraNoticias Hoy, viernes, día 11 de diciembre a las 20,00h. tendrá lugar la inauguración oficial de la novena edición de la Fiesta del Aceite Fresco de Cabra, con un nutrido programa de actividades, fundamentalmente, virtuales. Este año "especial" 2020, también ha requerido un "especial" desarrollo del evento denominado IX Fiesta del Aceite Fresco de Cabra, que presentará la mayor parte de sus actividades en modalidad telemática y/o on-line. Todas las actividades podrán seguidas a través de la web: www.fiestadelaceitefresco.com; Sin querer prescindir de la celebración por noveno año consecutivo de un consolidado evento ya a nivel no sólo provincial, sino autonómico, la Fiesta ha tenido que virar su carácter sensorial, personal y cercano hacia una innovadora versión digital que dispondrá del escaparate virtual: www.fiestadelaceitefresco.com; que estará abierta a todo el público en general durante no sólo este fin de semana, que se celebrarán la mayor parte de actividades programadas, sino a lo largo de todo el mes de diciembre del presente año. El Aceite de Oliva Virgen Extra Fresco de Cabra, no sólo dispondrá de una innovadora herramienta d

Vuelven las clases presenciales en CABA - Sobreviviendo FM Tras once meses alejados de las escuelas, los alumnos del CABA regresan hoy, miércoles 17 de febrero a las aulas de manera presencial. Con un protocolo estricto y de manera "escalonada y progresiva" para reducir el riesgo de contagios de coronavirus. Las clases antes de la pandemia "Hoy, miércoles comienzan las clases en esta nueva normalidad, buscando garantizar que todos los chicas vayan a la escuela", sostuvo la ministra de Educación porteña, Soledad Acuña. Asimismo, Acuña remarcó que durante la permanencia en los establecimientos educativos los niños "deben tener el barbijo puesto para cada actividad", a la vez que subrayó que también apuntan a "evitar que haya mucha gente esperando para salir o entrar". El inicio del ciclo lectivo 2021 Por su parte, el ministro de Educación de la Nación, Nicolás Trotta, explicó que habrá una "reorganización pedagógica" y "se va a comenzar por lo pendiente (de 2020) y lo proyectado" para 2021, así como recordó que "en caso de un contagio, se aislará a la burbuja". Este miércoles regresan a las aulas los alumnos de Nive

El PP quiere suprimir el impuesto a las primeras viviendas - Capital El PP de Pablo casado quiere suprimir el impuesto a las primeras viviendas El Partido Popular introdujo ayer varias enmiendas en el Senado para tratar de frenar el impuesto a la banca del impuesto de actos jurídicos documentados para primeras viviendas, además de presentar una nueva iniciativa para regular las hipotecas verdes. Ciudadanos votó a favor, logrando así el respaldo a la propuesta. No obstante, el texto definitivo debe superar aún su aprobación en el Pleno del Congreso de los Diputados que se celebrará la próxima semana, pudiendo sufrir cambios hasta entonces, matizan fuentes parlamentarias. El Partido Popular trató, sin éxito, fijar un tipo cero en el impuesto hipotecario en su paso por el Congreso, pero ahora parece haber concitado el apoyo de otras coaliciones limitando su aplicación en formalizaciones para la compra de la primera residencia. En cuanto a la hipoteca verde, el senador del PP y miembro ponente de la ley, Miguel Ángel Valverde, explicó que busca "promover el capital privado" hacia proyectos que mejoren la eficiencia energética. Las hipotecas verdes reguladas en una disposición adicional incorporada a la norma en tramitación son aquellas financiaciones para mejoras en inmuebles ya edificados que busquen optimizar la citada eficiencia energéticas, o proyectos nuevos de inversión con el mismo propósito, para el ahorro de agua o uso y almacenamiento de energías de fuente renovable. La principal ventaja que el PP busca reconocer al producto es que goce de los privilegios de los créditos refaccionarios pudiendo anotarse de manera preventiva telemática en el registro de la prop

Este es un pastel muy especial y socorrido en fiestas, reuniones especiales, etc. Me gusta mucho prepararlo porque no hay como la combinacion de pastel de chocolate y flan en un solo postre que se hace a baño María. De pensarlo hasta me dan ganas de ir a hacer otro enseguida! El Chocoflan también se conoce como "pastel imposible" y es un postre originario de México. A pesar del miedo que provoca el prepararlo, les aseguro que no es difícil. Para este postre, les sere franca, la parte del pastel de chocolate la hago con cajita preparada, porque ahorra tiempo y queda con la humedad necesaria y el balance perfecto con el flan. Asi lo he hecho siempre y como siempre tengo resultados perfectos, prefiero no hechar a perder esa reputacion que tiene en mi familia y amigos. El flan, ese si es mi receta de flan con ricotta, porque me gusta la cremosidad que adquiere. No se porque nunca habia publicado la receta, pero como ultimamente me la han pedido mis amigas, decidí que en la siguiente oportunidad que lo preparara le tomaria fotos al proceso y la escribiria como debe ser. Además es perfecta para las fiestas y posadas de Navidad, digo, quien puede resistirse a este postre, con esa combinacion? Debo hacer otra aclaración, lo normal es que en la base del molde se cubra con cajeta que muchos de ustedes conocen como dulce de leche. Como no vivo en México y aquí no consigo una cajeta estilo mexicano que me guste, mejor hago mi caramelo. Pueden sustituir y hacer ya sea con cajeta o caramelo sin problemas. pero si tengo que decir que prefiero el caramelo de todos modos, porque con la cajeta puede quedar muy empalagoso. 1.- Tome un molde de 10 pulgadas de diámetro de anillo desmoldable para pastel y lo cubrí por fuera de la base con papel aluminio, que proteja bien las paredes. 2.- Hacer el caramelo en una olla, agregamos el azúcar a flama media alta y vamos dejando que se derrita, moviendo muy de vez en cuando con una pala de madera, que el caramelo tenga un color ámbar y que toda el azúcar este completamente fundida, no debemos dejar que se queme. 3.- Vertimos el caramelo inmediatamente que esta listo en un molde para pastel de 10 pulgadas previamente engrasado ligeramente de las paredes del molde (yo uso de anillo desmoldable). Le vamos dando vueltas inclinándolo con cuidado para que el caramelo cubra todo el fondo y lo dejamos enfriar. 5.- Ponemos todos los ingredientes del pastel en la batidora, siguiendo las indicaciones del paquete y batimos hasta obtener una mezcla homogenea. 1.- Tomamos una charola gruesa grande para horno, que el molde del pastel quepa dentro y que tenga una profundidad para que al agregar el agua, le llegue con comodidad a la mitad de la altura del molde del pastel cuando este dentro de el. Precalentamos el horno a 180°C (350°F). También tenemos que tener lista agua hirviendo, la suficiente. 2.- Vaciamos en el molde, sobre el caramelo la mezcla del pastel y luego la del flan con cuidado. No te preocupes si se mezclan, a la hora del horneado se separaran las mezclas, por eso le llaman pastel imposible. 3.- Colocamos el molde con las mezclas en nuestra charola y aquí depende de como sientas el peso puedes hacer dos cosas. Una opción es meter la charola al horno y jalar un poco la rejilla donde la coloraras para verter el agua hirviendo con cuidado de que no salpique ni le caiga a la mezcla del pastel. Recuerda que el agua debe llegar a la mitad de la altura de la pared del molde del pastel. La otra opción es que antes de meter la charola al horno, viertas el agua hirviendo con cuidado y luego la pongas en el horno. Pero con el agua a veces la charola se hace muy pesada y es muy fácil tener un accidente y quemarte con el agua caliente. Tu decide que es mas fácil y toma precauciones. 4.- Deja el pastel a baño María en el horno por 1 hora y revisa, si al introducir un palillo en el centro sale limpio, el pastel esta listo. Las masas se separan al hornearse y el flan queda abajo y el pastel arriba. 5.- Saca del horno y de la charola con cuidado y deja enfriar por completo sin desmoldar. Me gusta meterlo al refrigerador cuando se enfría por unas horas y luego a la hora de servirlo lo volteas sobre un platón grande con cuidado y quitas el anillo. El pastel queda abajo al desmoldar y el flan arriba y toda la salsa de caramelo lo va a bañar. Ahora si que esta sintiéndose el aire bastante helado. Tuvimos muchisimas lluvias y vientos, con lo cual se cayeron bastantes hojas de los arboles. Así, lloviendo no se puede avanzar con la limpieza otoñal del jardín, pero el sábado vimos que el domingo haria sol y me dijo mi marido: "Ya sabes lo que tenemos que hacer mañana verdad?" . Pues si, resignacion, tendremos que trabajar todo el dia afuera y juntar lo mas posible de hojas. Así que decidi prepararme y desde el sábado prepare una olla grande de caldo tlalpeño, para no tener que preocuparme el domingo y nada mas terminar la faena, entrar y calentarlo. Fue muy buena idea porque entramos helados y cansados, francamente sin ganas de cocinar y con los brazos adoloridos. Ya nada mas era alistar unas cuantas cositas mas que ponerle al plato una vez servido. Aquí donde vivo no se consigue el epazote, que es una hierba que le da un sabor muy bueno a la comida y que se usa mucho en Mexico, así que sustituí por cilantro. Creanme que después de todo ese trabajo, fue la gloria. 1.- Hacer caldo con el pollo, cociendo las pechugas en agua suficiente a que las cubra con ajos, cebolla, apio, laurel, consomé o sal al gusto. Cocinarlas por 20 - 30 minutos o hasta que la carne este cocida. Retirar con una cuchara la espuma de vez en cuando. 2.- Sacar el pollo del caldo y deshebrarlo, reservamos y colamos el caldo que reservamos también deshechando lo demás. 3.- Mientras que el caldo se esta haciendo, en un sartén o comal con una cucharadita de aceite vegetal tostamos los tomates y el tomatillo y los licuamos, colamos y reservamos. Si no tienes tomatillo puedes usar solo tomates. 4.- Ponemos el caldo colado en una olla a fuego medio y agregamos la zanahoria y la calabacita picadas en cuadritos, el puré de tomate y dejamos que se cueza por unos 15 minutos o hasta que las verduras esten al dente. Rectificamos la sal. 6.- El caldo se sirve muy caliente con aguacate y fresco picado encima, chile chipotle al gusto (si gustas), limones partidos para que cada quien le ponga al gusto y tostitos o tortillas de maíz. Yo ademas les puse arroz blanco cocido en un lado en el caldo, no es la costumbre pero a nosotros asi nos gusta. Que mal he andado por el blog de recetas, no he tenido tiempo de editar. He cocinado y horneado muchas cosas, pero me ha faltado tiempo para hacerlo todo. Los dias no me rinden ultimamente como quisiera. Pero aqui vengo con otra receta mas de manzanas y ademas con peras. Tengo una amiga que tiene un peral en el patio de su casa (muy afortunada!) y me compartio bastantes peras. Con ellas y las muchisimas manzanas hice Mantequilla de Manzana y Pera. Si quieres ver como, puedes dar clic al enlace de Mantequilla de Manzana en Olla de Cocimiento Lento, lo unico diferente es que 2/3 partes eran manzana y 1/3 parte era pera. Quedo riquisima para untar y una buena parte la use para un pastel y para este flan, que queria que fuera muy especial. El flan fue para celebrar el baby shower de una amiga que esta por tener a su beba. Que mejor forma de festejar que con un postre especial. 1.- Lo primero es forrar un molde de esos de anillo desmoldable con papel aluminio por fuera y tener a la mano listos una charola grande donde quepa el molde y profunda para poner en baño María el flan. También hay que tener lista agua hiviendo. Mi molde es de 9 pulgadas o 23 cm de diámetro. 2.- Hacer el caramelo añadiendo en una olla anti adherente el azúcar a temperatura alta y dejar que se vaya derritiendo. Cuando se derrita todo muevo un poco con una cuchara de palo y sin dejar de vigilarlo porque se puede quemar. A mi no me gusta tan oscuro, solo lo dejo hasta que tiene un color a miel. Luego lo vacías rápidamente en el molde y lo mueves para cubrir todo el fondo y lo dejas enfriar. Lamento no mostrar todo, porque tienes que hacerlo rápido antes que se enfríe y no tenia a alguien mas que tomara las fotos. 3.- Poner en la procesadora la mantequilla o pure de manzana y pera, y procesar o moler para que la mezcla quede lo mas suave y terza posible. 5.- Vaciar sobre el el caramelo en el molde y meter a bano maria (que el agua caliente que viertas en la charola le llegue por fuera a la mitad de la altura del molde del flan, en horno precalentado a 180 C por 60-75 minutos o hasta que al insertar un palillo en el centro salga limpio. 6.- Sacar con cuidado, dejar que enfrie fuera del agua y refrigerar por unas horas o un dia antes y luego desmoldar con cuidado sobre un platon. Para adornar, pele y corte en rebanadas la manzana y pera. Puse en un sarten caliente la mantequilla y el azucar morena y agregue las rebanadas de la fruta, bajar a fuego medio. Mover de vez en cuando y cocinar hasta que la fruta este blandita. Dejar que enfrien y adornar con ellas el flan. Seguimos con las manzanas! Uff es que con tantas, me he visto haciendo mucho postre para aprovechar, además una amiga también me llevo peras de su árbol, así que proximamente verán por aquí también recetas con peras. Bueno, la tome de ahi pero de hice algunas modificaciones para hacerlo a mi estilo. Yo siempre ando intentando reducir las cantidades de azúcar de todo lo que horneo y cocino, además me gusta mas como quedan los pasteles con aceite que con mantequilla, no se, cuestión de gustos. Pero la receta les gusto muchisimo en casa y se termino muy rapido! Se ha convertido en un clásico muy rápido que voy a estar repitiendo seguido, con o sin frosting. Lo único que le falto fueron las nueces, que tristemente tengo que evitar por las alergias al cacahuate y nueces de árbol que tiene mi hija, si no fuera por eso le hubiera puesto nuez pecana. 2.- Para hacer la masa del pastel: Mezcla todos los ingredientes excepto las manzanas y nueces en un tazón grande, bate a velocidad baja hasta que este todo integrada. la masa quedara muy espesa e incluso con aspecto migajoso. 3.- Agrega la manzana en cuadritos y si quieres las nueces. Mezcla a velocidad media con la batidora por 3 o 5 minutos o hasta que las manzanas suelte un poco de su jugo y quede con textura tipo masa de brownie. 5.- Hornea por 45 minutos o hasta que al insertar un palillo en el centro salga limpio o con poquitas migajas pegadas (el mio salio limpio). 6.- Saca el pastel del horno y deja enfriar sobre una rejilla mientras haces el frosting. No desmoldes el pastel. 7.- Para hacer el frosting: Derrite la mantequilla en una olla pequeña a fuego medio y agrega el azúcar morena y sal, cocinando hasta que el azúcar se derrita. 8.- Agrega a la olla la leche y sigue calentando hasta que hierva y pasa lo a otro tazón para que se enfrie por 10 minutos. 9.- Pasado ese tiempo agrega el azúcar glass y vainilla mezclando bien. Si la mezcla se ve muy delgada agrega mas azúcar glass (yo no tuve que agregar mas). 10.- Vacía el frosting tibio sobre el pastel alisando la superficie con una espátula. Corta en cuadritos y sirve tibio o a temperatura ambiente. 11.- Puedes guardar el pastel tapado a temperatura ambiente por varios días o congelar. Pero yo mejor lo metí al refrigerador bien tapado. Cada vez que lo sacaba, solo lo calentaba unos segundos en el micro. Este fin de semana pasado fuimos a una granja que me habían recomendado mucho. es una granja que queda a escasos 7 minutos en carro de mi casa, en esta zona a media hora de Albany, la capital de NY, hay muchas. Y claro, en esta temporada todas las granjas están de fiesta por la cosecha y todas tienen no solo los productos que ofrecerte, sino una serie de actividades y diversiones para toda la familia. Desde recoger manzanas o calabazas, meterte a un laberinto de maizales, pasear en caballo o pony, acariciar y darles de comer a los animales, etc. Esta granja en concreto se llama "Bowman's Orchards" y es famosa por su enorme cantidad y variedad de manzanas. Aquí el chiste es llevarte tus bolsas e ir con la familia a recoger tus propias manzanas. Pero son muchos lotes, incluso te dan un mapa para que sepas donde esta el tipo de manzana que buscas y de cuales lineas de arboles puedes recoger, todas numeradas cuidadosamente y con listones de colores para que no te confundas. Pues bien, decidimos ir y con el bonus de que te dejan llevar a tu perro, pues mas animados para pasear a la chucha. Pero que fila para entrar, nada mas al estacionamiento, Dios mio! En sábado parecía que todo Nueva York había decidido ir a esa granja. Duramos bastante para poder entrar al estacionamiento, estacionarnos y luego bajar por las frutas. No tenia idea de cuanta gente iba a estar ahí. Familias completas que tienen la tradición de cada año ir por sus manzanas y vaya que la granja esta enorme. Y bueno, pues ahí nos tienen, probando y poniendo en la bolsa emocionados, que ya cuando llegamos a la salida para que nos pesaran la bolsa eran demasiadas, uff! Creo que vamos a estar a dieta de manzana por dos meses, se los juro, jajajaja! Voy a ponerme a hacer todo de manzana. Entonces, para empezar a darle uso a tanta manzana, decidí hacer un volteado. Pero a diferencia del volteado de piña o de fresa que ya he preparado en otras ocasiones, la manzana en mi opinión necesita de estar un poco mas blandita y ayudarle a darle un poco de mas sabor con una suave salsa de caramelo. Además utilice buttermilk (suero de leche) y a la harina le agregue maizena a la hora de cernirla, para obtener un resultado un poco mas suave como si fuera harina pastelera. También reduje un huevo de la receta que siempre hago, en fin que salio un pastel delicioso y les aseguro que desapareció por completo casi el mismo día. Así que no se sorprendan si ven muchas recetas de manzana por estos días, porque tendré que aprovecharlas todas, que aquí nunca se desperdicia nada. 1.- Cortar 3 de las manzanas a la mitad y luego en rebanadas no muy gruesas, la otra manzana la cortamos en cuadritos pequeños y la reservamos. Luego ponemos la mantequilla a calentar en un cazo y le agregamos el 1/4 de taza de azúcar y el azúcar morena y 1/2 cucharadita de canela que se derrita un poco. Luego agregamos las rebanadas de manzana y mezclamos con cuidado y agregamos una cucharadita de agua. Dejamos solo a que la manzana se ablande un poco y apagamos. Aqui lamento que me falto una foto. Escurrimos con cuidado las rebanadas de manzana, pero reservamos el rico jarabe que queda. Acomodamos las rebanadas en el fondo del molde. Tratar que sea muy poco el liquido de las manzanas porque si no, no se cocera bien el pastel. 3.- En un tazón aparte, batimos el resto del azúcar con el aceite a velocidad alta y hasta tener una mezcla homogenea. 8.- Sacamos del horno y dejamos enfriar por 5 minutos, luego lo volteamos y desmoldamos con cuidado. Bañamos con la salsa de caramelo por encima y servimos. Continuamos con las recetas mexicanas del mes. Cada vez que vamos de visita a México, mi mama y mi suegra se lucen en la cocina, consintiéndonos con platillos de los que solo ellas pueden preparar. Pero este verano tuve a mis suegros de visita con nosotros y mi suegra nos deleito con su famoso estofado de cerdo. Le queda sensacional y pude ver y registrar con fotos el paso a paso. 1.- Cortar la cebolla y tomate primero a la mitad y luego en rebanadas delgadas. Calentar una olla profunda con aceite vegetal. A flama media, doramos ligeramente la cebolla y el ajo, luego agregamos el tomate a que se guise con todo por un par de minutos. 2.- Agregamos la carne cortada en cubos grandes, como para estofado, mezclando con todo y dándole una guisada, solo por un par de minutos. 3.- Una vez que pase este tiempo, agregamos jugo de naranja el suficiente que cubra la carne. Salpimentamos al gusto y dejamos a flama media baja por unos minutos. 4.- Mientras, ponemos a remojar en agua hirviendo 6 chiles del árbol, sin el rabito y habiendo sacado cuantas semillas sea posible. Una vez que se ablandan los licuamos utilizando solo de 1/2 a 3/4 de taza del agua en que se ablando, dependiendo de lo que veamos que necesita la licuadora. Es muy importante no agregar agua de mas. 5.- Regresamos al guiso y le agregamos 1/2 taza de puré de tomate, papas cortadas en cuartos y trozos de zanahoria también en cuartos o sextos. Deben ser trozos grandes. 6.- Rectificamos la sal y agregamos aproximadamente 1 cucharadita de orégano seco y las hojas de laurel. Mezclamos y dejamos que siga el cocimiento por otros 5 minutos. Todo debe estar cubierto por liquido, si ves que falta, agrega un poco de agua y rectifica la sal. 7.- Finalmente agregamos el chile licuado y colado y mezclamos bien. Tapamos y dejamos que se cueza hasta que las papas y zanahorias estén blanditas pero sin hacerse pure.. Servimos con arroz, es un plato que queda un poco picoso por el chile del árbol, pero la combinacion con le naranja de la un sabor exquisito. El chile del árbol es muy importante en este plato, pero puedes reducir la cantidad si no te gusta tan picoso, eso si, no puedes dejar este asado sin chile, porque perdería la magia de su sabor. Me encanta el helado, pero tengo que confesar que siempre acabamos comprandolo de vainilla o de nuez. Todo porque a mi hija no le gusta el chocolate... Si, ya se que no me lo van a creer, pero es de los pocos niños que no comen chocolate. Y como mi marido prefiere el helado de nuez, lo que siempre hago es ponerle jarabe de chocolate encima. De todos modos decidí hacer helado, para darme un gusto y en vez de hacerlo de chocolate, me dispuse a hacerlo de moca (moka, mocha). Aprovechando que fuimos a una granja cercana a comprar huevos y mantequilla, me traje también doble crema, para preparar mi helado y como aun tengo una buena dotación de chocolate mexicano, lo utilice para preparar mi antojo. Siempre me gusta tener chocolate mexicano para el Otoño e Invierno, que están por llegar, porque el chocolate caliente queda delicioso, con un toque de canela y nueces que tiene en el fondo y en el helado no me decepciono, combinado con el café resulto delicioso. Me trajo recuerdos de los cafés en México, pues en muchos de ellos, cuando pides un café moca, le espolvorean canela encima. Yo le puse toda la tableta de chocolate, pero si no te gusta que el chocolate domine tanto, puedes poner solo la mitad. Si no tienes chocolate mexicano pero quieres el sabor similar, puedes utilizar alguna tablilla de chocolate del que consigas y agregar a la mezcla una cucharadita de canela, te aseguro que el sabor quedara delicioso! Una ultima cosa, le puse poca azucar porque el chocolate mexicano trae bastante, asi que ten es

Talleres Soy - Los 'pibes' volvieron a poner la cara 18/02/2019 - Con un equipo alternativo, Talleres igualó sin goles frente a Huracán y sumó su segundo empate consecutivo en esta Superliga. En ambas ocasiones, ante equipos que pelean arriba. Con un ojo puesto en el partido por Copa del miércoles y otro en la Superliga, Talleres empató 0-0 frente al Globo en el Mario Alberto Kempes. En un encuentro sin demasiadas luces, los juveniles de la "T" volvieron a sacar pecho ante uno de los equipos mejor ubicados de la tabla y, al igual que en Tucumán, demostraron estar a la altura. En el primer tiempo, Huracán no supo como encontrarle la vuelta al equipo de Vojvoda. A base de garra y una cuota de buen fútbol (de lo poco que hubo en la tarde), los locales tuvieron las situaciones más claras en esos primeros 45 minutos. La primera llegó en los pies de Fernando Bersano, quien tras recibir un muy buen pase filtrado de Gonzalo Maroni, puso a prueba los reflejos del arquero rival, Anthony Silva. El 10 del Matador, al igual que Medina, volvió a tener minutos en cancha luego de lo que fue su participación en el Torneo Sudamericano sub 20. A los 22 minutos, Talleres volvió a intentar mediante una muy buena aproximación del ex Boca, que tuvo la última del primer tiempo. En el complemento, si bien la "T" siguió teniendo situaciones claras, el Globo empezó a acercarse un poco más al arco defendido por Mauricio Caranta, a quien lo pusieron a prueba y respondió. Después de otra llegada del local a través de Bersano, Huracán tuvo la primer chance clara en el partido con un cabezazo de su lateral izquierdo, Walter Pérez. El defensor apareció por sorpresa en el área rival y con un cabezazo hizo volar al experimentado arquero albiazul, quien mandó la pelota al corner. Minutos después, a los 25' más precisamente, Caranta volvió a aparecer para sacarle un muy buen remate, esta vez a Juan Fernando Garro, quien había ingresado minutos antes en lugar de Lucas Gamba. Mientras más se iba acercando el final del partido, más iba disminuyendo el rendimiento colectivo de Talleres, así como el de sus intérpretes. Luego de la lesión de Javier Gandolfi antes de cumplirse los 30 minutos del complemento, el compromiso entró en una meseta y ninguno de los equipos logró situaciones de peligro. El final fue un reflejo de lo que fue el encuentro en general: chato y aburrido. El Matador, con la cabeza puesta en la siguiente fase de Libertadores, sumó otro punto importante ante uno de los rivales "más difíciles" del torneo. Si bien hoy Huracán no lo demostró así, posee una ubicación privilegiada en la tabla junto a los que pelean por el título. Así mismo, el triunfo hubiera sido tan solo una caricia al alma dentro de una jornada tan opaca como lo fue debido a la lesión de Leonardo Godoy, uno de los pilares que tiene este equipo de la "T". Talleres: Mauricio Caranta; Renzo Paparelli, Javier Gandolfi (Juan Cruz Komar), Facundo Medina; Joel Soñora (Mauro Ortíz), Fernando Juárez, Fernando Navarro, Gonzalo Maroni, Fernando Bersano; Diego Valoyes y Junior Arias (Dayro Moreno). DT: Juan Pablo Vojvoda. Huracán: Anthony Silva; Cristian Chimino, Saul Salcedo, Federico Mancinelli, Omar Alderete, Walter Pé

Panel y MercadoLibre en octubre de este año, 5 de cada 10 mexicanos utilizará Internet para buscar inmuebles en renta y pasar las vacaciones decembrinas. Por este motivo, MercadoLibre.com, la mayor plataforma de compras y ventas por Internet de América Latina, emite algunas de las recomendaciones que deben considerarse al momento de rentar una casa o departamento por Internet para las próximas vacaciones. Los clasificados en Internet funcionan de manera similar a los de los diarios impresos. En ambos casos, los arrendadores publican sus datos de contacto (teléfono e email), luego acuerdan un encuentro con los posibles inquilinos y establecen condiciones de renta. En Internet, la diferencia es que los arrendadores pueden publicar fotos y hasta videos para que los interesados puedan conocer el estado de la casa antes de concretar una cita para verla personalmente. En este sentido, la seguridad depende de las precauciones que tomen ambas personas y por ello, hacer uso del sentido común es lo más importante. 2) Antes de pagar la renta o depositar un adelanto, conoce la casa o departamento Par

CÓMO CUIDAR BIEN TU GRINKGO BILOBA - Tienda todo jardín > Blog>Root>CÓMO CUIDAR BIEN TU GRINKGO BILOBA En: Root Comentario: 0 Golpear: 1487 Hoy os queremos hablar de un árbol lleno de historia, el Grinkgo Biloba, originario de china y considerado sagrado por diferentes culturas. El Grinkgo Biloba es un árbol coducifolio de crecimiento lento, durante los primeros 10 años sus ramas son escasas y su tronco, de color gris parduzco, fino. Suele crecer alrededor de 20 cm semanales. Una vez desarrollado, se convierte en un árbol majestuoso de copa piramidal que llega a alcanzar los 35 metros. Sus hojas son muy especiales, en forma de abanico, lobuladas y divididas en dos partes (de ahí su nombre). Se trata de un árbol dioico, ya que sus flores pueden ser femeninas o masculinas según el árbol. Los frutos de los árboles hembra exhalan un olor muy agradable cuando están maduros. El Grinkgo Biloba es muy apreciado desde el punto de vista de la salud, ya que sus flores se utilizan para realizar remedios naturales para mejorar la circulación sanguínea. El Grinkgo Biloba en la historia: Una vez finalizados los efectos de la bomba de Hiroshima, muy cerca del lugar de la explosión rebrotó un Grinkgo destruido durante el estallido. Esto hizo que Hiroshima se considera un símbolo de renacimiento y es objeto de veneración. Esta resistencia a la adversidad hizo que la medicina decidiera dedicar tiempo y recursos a la investigación de las propiedades de este árbol, considerado sagrado en China. Cada día se descubren más cualidades de esta generosa especie. Aunque se trata de un árbol muy resistente a plagas, enfermedades y las condiciones externas, si quieres que tu Grinkgo Biloba crezca fuerte y sano, es recomendable tener en cuenta los siguientes cuidados. Es un árbol de exterior que ocupa poco espacio por lo que puede plantarse en terrazas y superficies pequeñas. En cuanto al riego, en general es suficiente con realizarlo semanalmente, en verano deb

Film Jackets ha sacado una pedazo de chaqueta basada en el popular justiciero de Hell’s Kitchen, Daredevil. La chaqueta esta inspirado el traje de la segunda temporada de Daredevil en Netflix. El precio como os podéis imaginar no es que sea precisamente barato, ya que son $149 y está rebajado de $199. El detalle parece que está bastante conseguido, es bastante “fiel” al traje original de la serie. Si queréis haceros con esta chaqueta podéis ir a la página web, igual no tardamos mucho en verla por alguna frikitienda espa

Bundesliga: El Dortmund sigue goleando – El Rincón del Fútbol Bundesliga: El Dortmund sigue goleando En su visita a Wolsfburgo, el conjunto Borusser volvió a montar un show de goles y apabulló 5-1 al local. Aubameyang, por duplicado, Guerreiro, Dembelé y Piszczek rubricaron la goleada de un Dortmund que marcó 17 goles en sus últimos tres partidos por todas las competiciones. Esta cuarta jornada de la Bundesliga disputada entresemana empezaba con cuatro encuentros, pero el que resaltaba entre todos ellos era este choque entre un Wolsfburgo, que tenía la intención de hacerse fuerte de local para llevarse una victoria que lo acercara a los líderes Bayern Múnich y Hertha Berlín, y un Borussia Dortmund que tampoco quería perderle pisada a los que encabezan la tabla. El conjunto visitante arrancó totalmente enchufado y se puso rápidamente en ventaja. Marc Bartra, que luego debió salir lesionado, encontró con una pelota profunda fantástica a Raphaël Guerreiro, quien batió al arquero Koen Casteels por el primer palo con ayuda de un desvío en el defensor. Wolfsburgo intentó reaccionar y casi lo empata, pero apareció el arquero Roman Bürki, de gran tarde, para interponerse. Sobre los quince, otro ataque letal de los de Tuchel iba a poner las cosas 2-0. Después de un lateral, Guerreiro asistió con un taco a Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, que eludió con categoría a Philipp Wollscheid, ingresó al área y definió contra el segundo palo abriendo el pie. El capitán Marcel Schmelzer tuvo el 3-0, pero esta vez Casteels se lo negó. A partir de ahí el equipo local creció en el juego, comenzó a inquietar al fondo visitante e hizo lucir a Bürki en dos oportunidades. En primera instancia, el suizo le tapó un remate a quemarropa a Mario Gómez y luego despejó de gran forma un tiro libre de su compatriota Ricardo Rodríguez. Para la segunda mitad, el elenco de Dieter Hecking salió decidido a acortar la desventaja y el Dortmund iba a sufrir varios embates. En primer lugar, Bürki se disfrazó de héroe e impidió el descuento a Julian Draxler y a Mario Gómez dentro de la mi

El alcalde de La Paz, Iván Arias, acudió este jueves a su citación ante la Fiscalía por presunto incumplimiento a una sentencia constitucional en un caso laboral de 2016, correspondiente a la gestión del exalcalde Luis Revilla. El burgomaestre sostuvo, antes de ingresar, que ni él ni sus funcionarios van a escapar. «Primero nos vamos a informar de los detalles de la acusación, que viene de hace cinco años y ahora la activan conmigo después de unos días de protesta», expresó Arias, a su arribo. «Se está cumpliendo lo que han dicho ellos, que van a salir a ser implacables con los que osen oponerse y aquí estamos. (…) El objetivo es siempre el mismo: ponernos trancas. El odio no va a poder derrotarnos, yo les aseguro. Yo voy a seguir trabajando por la ciudad y voy a venir cada vez que me cite la Fiscalía». Según detalló Arias, conoce de forma extraoficial que existen otros cuatro procesos en su contra que «están armando» y aseguró que se presentará a cada uno de ellos. «Nosotros estaremos listos. No nos vamos a ir, no vamos a escapar», recalcó. También puede leer: Fiscalía cita a Arias por caso de 2016, él denuncia acoso Desde el inicio de la gestión del alcalde Arias, la autoridad afronta siete procesos judiciales activados desde distintos ámbitos del Gobierno y la justicia. Con la nueva citación, es el octavo proceso al alcalde. En septiembre tuvo que comparecer en la Fiscalía por un supuesto caso de discriminación contra César Dockweiler, candidato a la Alcaldía del Movimiento Al Socialismo (MAS).

"En Unión no tengo reconocimiento" : : El Litoral - Noticias - Santa Fe - Argentina - ellitoral.com : : Lunes 01.06.2020 - Última actualización - 12:27 El Turco Alí, máximo goleador de la historia tatengue... El Turco también se refirió a su relación con Nery Pumpido: "No es de la mejor forma posible, pero sí de mucho respeto y saludo. Nos debemos un café. Pasamos muchas cosas juntos", señaló uno de los ídolos rojiblancos. Fernando Alí, el popular Turco, cuando ya era entrenador y dirigía a Unión. Ese equipo del 2009-2010 hizo una muy buena primera rueda pero se "pinchó" en la segunda. Fernando Alí, el popular Turco, cuando ya era entrenador y dirigía a Unión. Ese equipo del 2009-2010 hizo una muy buena primera rueda pero se "pinchó" en la segunda. Crédito: Mauricio Garin El Turco Alí, máximo goleador de la historia tatengue... "En Unión no tengo reconocimiento" El Turco también se refirió a su relación con Nery Pumpido: "No es de la mejor forma posible, pero sí de mucho respeto y saludo. Nos debemos un café. Pasamos muchas cosas juntos", señaló uno de los ídolos rojiblancos. El Turco también se refirió a su relación con Nery Pumpido: "No es de la mejor forma posible, pero sí de mucho respeto y saludo. Nos debemos un café. Pasamos muchas cosas juntos", señaló uno de los ídolos rojiblancos. Hace unos días El Litoral recordaba aquella gira que Unión realizó en 1981 por Europa. Disputó un torneo en España y luego hizo un entrenamiento en el Santiago Bernabeu. En aquella oportunidad, el Turco Alí no participó pero fue porque justo en ese momento había sido transferido al Valladolid. Y a fuerza de ser sinceros y bien viene la aclaración, aquella venta del Turco propició la realización de esa gira histórica por el Viejo Continente que hizo el plantel que, por entonces, dirigía Carmelo Faraone. El Turco Alí, máximo goleador de la historia de Unión, fue entrevistado por el colega Emiliano Nunia en Villa Trinidad y puso de manifiesto toda su sinceridad sobre algunos temas que tienen que ver con la historia tatengue. Protagonista de la final de 1979, cuando Unión empató los dos partidos con River pero fue segundo porque River marcó un gol de visitante en el 15 de Abril, entiende que ese partido fue el más importante de la historia de Unión, colocándolo por encima de la final de 1989 ante Colón por el ascenso a Primera. Al igual que lo que declaró Víctor Alfredo Bottaniz a El Litoral, Alí también se refirió a la falta de reconocimiento. "No tengo el reconocimiento que a lo mejor se le hace a otros ex jugadores en otros clubes. No somos consultados como deberíamos ser y tampoco tenemos ese 'mimo' que deberíamos tener", dijo el hombre que, con sus 89 goles, es el máximo artillero de la historia rojiblanca. Fernando Husef Alí (65 años) fue sinónimo de gol. Esa raza privilegiada que posee en sus pies el pasaporte a la efímera felicidad. Gol de Unión, gol de Alí. Siempre era así y es un privilegio que ostenta y que parece muy difícil que alguien en lo inmediato lo pueda superar. Ali, es palabra autorizada para hablar del mundo tatengue y cuando lo hace, lo hace con el corazón y con mucha sinceridad. Esta charla no fue la excepción. A la hora de posicionar los mejores momentos del fútbol santafesino y de Unión, el Turco priorizó la final con River, del año 1979, antes del ascenso ante Colón en el año 1989 y dio sus motivos. "El ascenso de 1989 tuvo trascendencia porque fue ante el clásico rival, pero creo que hubo varios ascensos en el club. Resalta el hecho de haberle ganado la fi

Filtran video de Pío López Obrador, hermano de AMLO, recibiendo dinero para campañas de Morena en 2015 | Border Hub Center Filtran video de Pío López Obrador, hermano de AMLO, recibiendo dinero para campañas de Morena en 2015 El hermano del presidente habría recibido el dinero de David León Romero, ex coordinador Nacional de Protección Civil del Gobierno Federal y exasesor del entonces gobernador de Chiapas Manuel Velasco, quien actualmente coordina a bancada del Partido Verde en el Senado David León Romero, ex coordinador Nacional de Protección Civil del Gobierno Federal, entregó dinero en efectivo -de parte de la entonces Administración estatal de Manuel Velasco Coello-, a Pío López Obrador, hermano del actual presidente de la República, para supuestamente apuntalar al partido político Morena en el sureste del país, rumbo al proceso electoral del 2018. El pasado 30 de julio, el mandatario nacional nombró a León Romero como nuevo director de una distribuidora de insumos médicos a cargo del Estado mexicano, y dijo que el ahora exfuncionario federal era "un servidor público eficaz, dedicado y comprometido, porque de ese nivel es la importancia de su nueva encomienda". Andrés Manuel López Obrador y su hermano Pío. Foto Zeta / Tijuana. Este ahora exfuncionario federal entregó, en su momento, durante el 2015, al menos dos millones de pesos en efectivo dentro de bolsas o sobres de papel a Pío López Obrador, fundador de Morena en Chiapas y quien también fungió como consejero nacional de dicho partido político. "Esto es para el tema de apoyarlos en el movimiento aquí […] Te voy a tener la fecha exacta para que recojan el segundo millón y terminamos […] Hazle saber al licenciado a través de tus medios que lo estamos apoyando […] El chiste es que él vea que hay apoyo", se escucha decir en el video al ahora exfuncionario federal. "Respecto al video: debe tener aprox. 5 años de antigüedad. De nov. de 2013 a nov. de 2018 yo fui consultor, no servidor público. Mi manera de apoyar al Movimiento, fue recolectar recursos entre conocidos para la realización de asambleas y otras actividades" (SIC), escribió León Romero en su cuenta de la red social Twitter. En ese entonces León Romero fungía como asesor del Gobierno estatal de Velasco Coello (2012-2018), actual coordinador del grupo parlamentario del Partido Verde Ecologista Mexicano (PVEM) en el Senado de la República, donde hace una alianza con la bancada de Morena. En el video -presentado este jueves 20 de agosto por el periodista Carlos Loret de Mola Álvarez, en su programa 'Loret Capítulo 12', transmitido en la cuenta de la plataforma YouTube, del medio digital LatinUs-, se escucha decir al hermano del actual presidente de la República que Andrés Manuel López Obrador está enterado del apoyo brindado por el entonces gobernador chiapaneco. El 24 de octubre del 2019, el diario Reforma reveló que Pío López Obrador ofreció fondos presupuestales, acceso a créditos y protección de órganos auditores a 21 alcaldes de Chiapas, siempre y cuando se sumaran a las filas de Morena. Durante su conferencia de prensa matutina de ese mismo día, el presidente López Obrador descalificó la publicación del rotativo, al asegurar que "habría que probarlo", e insistió que nadie de su familia o alguien vinculado a él, puede cometer algún acto de corrupción o de nepotismo. "Además, no sólo no deben, sino que caería en la esfera del derecho penal y serían juzgados", afirmó el mandatario nacional, quien recordó que existe un memorándum fechado el 13 de junio del 2019, en el que ordenó a funcionarios no permitir gestiones de ninguno de sus familiares para su beneficio o para "sus recomendados". "Les reitero, no acepto bajo ninguna circunstancia, que miembros de mi familia hagan gestiones, trámites o lleven a cabo negocios con el Gobierno en su beneficio o a favor de sus recomendados. Eso incluye a mi esposa, hijos, hermanos, hermana, primos, tíos, cuñados, nueras, concuños y demás miembros de mi familia, cercana o distante", ordena en el memorándum. El documento firmado por López Obrador señala, también, que "los funcionarios públicos no tienen la obligación de escuchar propuestas indecorosas de nadie […] ni siquiera de recibirlos en las oficinas o contestarles el teléfono. Nada de nada". El político tabasqueño señaló que lo dicho por Reforma "como que pinta para calumnia, por aquello que la calumnia cuando no mancha tizna. Entonces está mal que familiares, amigos, tomen esas decisiones […] pero hay que ver si es cierto", insistió. Por su parte, Pío López Obrador incursionó en la política en 1989, cuando participó en la fundación del Partido de la Revolución Democrática (PRD), y en 2006 fue el coordinador de campaña de López Obrador en Chiapas. En 2014, ya con Morena, se le encomendó el liderazgo de dicho instituto político en ese estado del sureste, cargo que compartió con su hermano José Ramiro.

Archive for the 'Infección urinaria' Category Published by Médico Urólogo Rodrigo Leyton Naranjo, en Santiago, Chile on 17 Jun 2015 La INFECCION URINARIA puede presentarse en cualquier momento y les da a hombres y mujeres por igual, aunque puede tener mayor incidencia en aquellas en estado de embarazo. Es recomendable acudir a un urólogo cuando se presentan los síntomas de INFECCION URINARIA. En Santiago de Chile hay un especialista accesible al que puede consultar con la mayor tranquilidad: se trata de Rodrigo Leyton Naranjo médico cirujano especialista en Urología de la Universidad de Santiago, entidad en la que también es profesor. Es miembro y director de la Sociedad Chilena y de la Sociedad Internacional de Urología, tiene amplia experiencia en fertilidad humana, incontinencia urinaria, cáncer testicular, INFECCION URINARIA, entre otras áreas de resorte de esta disciplina como la enuresis, el cáncer de próstata, la disfunción eréctil o impotencia sexual. Lo consigue en su consultorio de la clínica INDISA, en Providencia. En qué consiste la INFECCION URINARIA La INFECCION URINARIA se refiere a la presencia de signos y síntomas clínicos derivados de las vías genitourinarias y microorganismos en la orina. Ésta puede estar localizada en la en la vejiga y es lo que se conoce como cistitis, en el riñón, que es la pielonefritis o en la próstata (prostatitis bacteriana aguda o crónica). La INFECCION URINARIA del tracto urinario se puede tratar con antibióticos aunque existen muchos remedios naturales para combatirla. Algunas veces, la INFECCION URINARIA cede sin medicamentos, cuando no es grave. En todo caso, si ésta se repite con alguna frecuencia, es decir dos o más en seis meses o, se presenta en tres o más episodios en un año (esto sobre todo se da en mujeres jóvenes), es necesario hacer un estudio y un tratamiento más especializados, que los debe hacer un experto como el doctor Leyton. Detalles de la INFECCION URINARIA que es bueno saber En las mujeres es más frecuente contraer una INFECCION URINARIA porque que la uretra es más corta y está más cerca del ano, a diferencia de los hombres. Por esta razón, las probabilidades de que las mujeres contraigan una infección urinaria son más altas, sobre todo después de la actividad sexual o al utilizar diafragma para el control natal. La menopausia también aumenta el riesgo de contraerla.

Hace muchos años, las zapatillas eran uno de esos elementos que podíamos incorporar a nuestros outfits solo cuando fuéramos más de sport. Ya fuera en fines de semana, festivos o cualquier otro día en los que fuéramos a realizar una actividad que no era habitual en nuestro día a día. El paso de los años, el peso de la comodidad, la renovación estética y su transversalidad con el ámbito de la moda, ha hecho que la industria del calzado deportivo haya conseguido llegar a un tipo de público que jamás se hubiera podido prever. Solamente tenemos que ver algunas de las principales semanas de la moda del mundo para observar el cada vez mayor peso que esta industria está teniendo.

Claro, puede haber otros productos exitosos, como Sonos PlayBase, que obviamente puede integrarse con un sistema Sonos si tiene uno, pero cuesta mucho más. El M2 tiene que ver con la rentabilidad. Es importante destacar que el perfil de sonido del M2 es excelente. Ya sea en los modos de película o música, los controladores BMR y los perfiles de ajuste de sonido aseguran que suene amplio y rico desde todos los ángulos. Realmente puedes subirlo cuando quieras presumir a tus amigos, o mantenerlo bajo si no quieres molestar a los vecinos. Después de una semana de usar el M2, lo desconectamos de nuestro televisor solo para ver cuál sería la diferencia. Todo lo que podemos decir es que tuvimos que volver a enchufarlo de inmediato, porque su mejora de sonido es algo que ahora ya no podemos vivir sin él. Un sistema más caro puede ser más elegante, pero a este precio no nos importa: el M2 ofrece todo lo que podría desear y más. Sonos PlayBase es tan fácil de recomendar como Q Acoustics M2. Suena fenomenal y puede usarse como parte de un sistema Sonos, ya sea para música o para una ex

Crímenes económicos contra la humanidad – Revista digital de Humanidades Sarasuati / E-Journal of the Humanities Sarasuati Dom, jun 17 2012 | Published in C. Políticas Un sistema bancario mundial está siendo preparado aquí… y un súper-estado de banqueros internacionales que actúan conjuntamente para esclavizar al mundo en pos de su propio placer. [Louis McFadden] Es hora de hablar de ello. La tecnología ha desembocado en un mecanismo económico de control de masas. En el siglo XXI, cada vez más, ya es un hecho probado que las armas están siendo suplidas por el mecanismo financiero como vías de control y opresión. Sus variantes son múltiples, desde el clásico embargo (Cuba), a sanciones revestidas de legalidad ejercidas a través de la ONU (Irán), al nuevo intervencionismo: rescate financiero. Mediante esta misma tecnología global, se ha generado un dinero ficticio: el crédito. Anterior al crack de 1929, el dinero era intercambiable por oro. En la actualidad, desde 1933 e impulsado por la Reserva Federal estadounidense, el dinero es solo papel o un número digital en la pantalla. De esta forma, al ofrecer un dinero que no es intercambiable por oro, con existencia limitado, el nuevo dinero es ilimitado. Y este hecho es el que nos ha traído hasta la crisis de 2008, un juego bancario cuyas reglas han sido cuidadosamente establecidas para que the winner takes it all –el ganador se quede con todo-. La propia palabra secreta es repugnante en una sociedad libre y abierta, nos hemos opuesto como pueblo inherentemente e históricamente a las sociedades secretas y juramentos secretos. Y a procedimientos secretos. Porque nos enfrenta en todo el mundo una conspiración monolítica y despiadada, que se basa principalmente en medios encubiertos para expandir su esfera de influencia, basada en infiltraciones en lugar de invasión, en su elección en lugar de elecciones, en intimidación en lugar de libre elección. Es un sistema que ha construido vastos recursos humanos y materiales para construir una maquinaria eficiente, una maquinaria estrechamente entretejida que combina operaciones militares, diplomáticas, de inteligencia, económicas, científicas, y políticas. Sus preparativos son ocultos, no se publican, sus errores son enterrados, no salen en los periódicos, sus disidentes son silenciados no elogiados, no se cuestionan los gastos, no se revelan los secretos. El por eso, que el legislador ateniense Salom decretó delito que los ciudadanos se desentiendan de las controversias públicas. Pido su ayuda en la labor de informar y alertar a la población norteamericana, confiando que con su ayuda los hombres serán como han nacido: libres e independientes. [John F. Kenedy] Lo explicaré de forma muy simplificada. La Reserva Federal, un banco privado independiente jamás auditado, tiene el control y la capacidad de inyectar liquidez, esto es, imprimir dinero y distribuirlo en Estados Unidos. Además de conceder créditos con intereses, por ejemplo, al propio estado norteamericano para financiar las guerras de Iraq y Afganistán. Cosa que viene haciendo ya desde antes de la Guerra de Vietnam. También, es la entidad que ofrece capital a los propios bancos, convirtiéndose así en subsidiarios de la misma. De esta forma, el juego es simple, la Reserva Federal inunda de capital el mercado, las instituciones públicas y privadas, y la sociedad durante un lapso amplio de tiempo, para luego cortar de raíz la financiación o crédito y pasar exigir que la devolución de los prestado. Consecuentemente, los bancos y otras entidades que no pueden afrontar los pagos, quiebran. Casos de Lehman Brothers, Freddie Mac y Fannie Mae (2008). De esta manera, la propia Reserva Federal y su verdadero entramado bancario afianza su hegemonía al hacer tabla rasa, eliminar competencia, y apropiarse de, o intervenir a, bienes inmuebles y entidades ¿Nos suena esto? Sí. Grecia, Irlanda, Portugal… otras 'entidades' que no pueden afrontar los pagos. Evidentemente propiciado por sus homólogos en Europa y el Mundo: Banco Central Europeo (BCE) y el Fondo Monetario Internacional (FMI). El mecanismo de devaluación del dinero en la sociedad estadounidense viene determinado también por la Reserva Federal. Es decir, tienen la capacidad de poner precio al dinero, y con ello regular tanto los ingresos del ciudadano como el valor de sus propiedades. ¿Nos suena esto? Sí. Las agencias de Rating Standards & Poor, Fitch y Moody's desempeñan esta misma labor de devaluación sobre los estados, su bienestar social y sus políticas económicas. Mediante la devaluación de la calidad de la nota, consiguen un mayor porcentaje de interés para los inversores. La verdad es que un grupo de los centros financieros es dueño del gobierno desde los días de Andrew Jackson. [Franklin Roosevelt] Por todo ello, cuando se habla de crisis, se debería hablar de estafa, y cuando se habla de falta de liquidez y crédito, se debería hablar de fin de ciclo de un plan secretamente urdido por la élite, haciendo tremendamente vigente la visión distópica de John F. Kenedy anteriormente citada. El mundo está gobernado por personajes muy distintos a los que la gente se imagina que no está detrás de la escena. [Benjamin Dislaeli] En plena crisis, tras cuatro años de idas, venidas y políticas de austeridad, es hora de alzar la voz al unísono, divulgar sin miedo esta verdad, conquistar el espacio público, recurrir a la desobediencia cívica y pacífica, y exigir que existan crímenes económicos contra la humanidad, situándolos a la misma altura que los crímenes de guerra y el genocidio. Para empezar debemos desenmascarar a esa élite que yace en la sombra, y para hacer justicia exponerlos públicamente y, en última instancia, promover una acción ciudadana coordinada para llevarlos ante los tribunales desde 1910 hasta la actualidad. Ante la negativa gubernamental de crear un banco central estadounidense, en 1907, J. P. Morgan con su poder de influencia hizo correr el rumor que un banco de Nueva York era insolvente y que estaba quebrado. Sabía que esto causaría histeria masiva y que a la vez esto afectaría a otros bancos, y así fue. El público, temiendo perder sus depósitos, comenzó a retirar masivamente su dinero, y consecuentemente los bancos se vieron forzados a reclamar y cancelar sus préstamos a la población, obligando a vender sus productos y así comenzó una espiral de quiebras, reposesiones y desorden. En 1910 hubo una reunión secreta en Jekyll Island, en las costas de Georgia, donde se redactó la ley del banco central, llamada Acta de la Reserva Federal. Fue escrita por banqueros, no legisladores. Fue entonces entregada a su promotor Nelson Aldrich, quien estaba casado con la hija de Rockefeller, para introducirla en el congreso estadounidense. Y en 1913, Wilson fue presidente con el apoyo bancario, habiendo aceptado firmar la nueva legislación a cambio de apoyo en su campaña de banqueros como J.D. Rockefeller, J.P. Morgan, Paul Warburg, o Baron Rothschild. Pero, ¿Qué es realmente un banco central? Es una institución que produce la moneda de una nación entera. Basados en el precedente histórico, existen dos poderes específicos intrínsecos en las prácticas del banco central. A) el control de las tasas de interés b) el control de suministro de dinero (inflación). El banco central no solo provee dinero a la economía de un gobierno, sino que se lo presta con interés. Así pues, aumentando o disminuyendo el suministro de dinero, el banco central regula el valor del dinero. Es crucial entender que la estructura entera de este sistema puede producir una solo cosa a largo plazo: deuda. O lo que es lo mismo, el plan de una estafa. Cada céntimo prestado, lo es con interés. Y como el banco central tiene el monopolio para producir la moneda, para pagar cada préstamo ¿de dónde sale el dinero? Solo puede venir nuevamente del Banco Central. Lo que significa que el Banco Central tiene que incrementar su suministro de dinero para temporalmente cubrir la deuda creada, y puesto que este dinero es también prestado con interés, crea más deuda. El resultado final de este sistema es la esclavitud, porque es imposible para el gobierno y para el público, salirse de este círculo vicioso. Creo que las instituciones bancarias son más peligrosas que un ejército… si el pueblo americano alguna vez permite a los bancos privados controlar la emisión de moneda, los bancos y corporaciones que crecerán alrededor de ellas privarán al pueblo de su propiedad, hasta que sus hijos despierten sin casa en el continente que sus padres conquistaron. Si quieren seguir siendo esclavos de los banqueros y pagar por el coste de su propia esclavitud, permitidles que sigan creando el dinero y controlando el crédito de la nación. [Sir Josiah Stamp] Nuestra gran nación industrial está controlada por el sistema de crédito. Nuestro sistema de crédito está concentrado en manos privadas. El crecimiento de la nación y por consiguiente de todas nuestras actividades están en manos de unos pocos hombres, quienes por motivos de sus propias limitaciones, congelan, frenan y destruyen la genuina libertad económica. Nos hemos transformado en uno de los peor gobernados, uno de los más completamente controlados de los gobiernos del mundo civilizado. Ya no hay gobierno de libre opinión. Ya no hay gobierno de convicciones y de voto de las mayorías sino un gobierno de la opinión y coacción de un pequeño grupo de hombres dominante. [Woodrow Wilson] Desgraciadamente, la visión de J.F. Kenedy, y los avisos, entre otros, de Louis McFadden Y Roosevelt, están a la orden del día de una manera provocado por el plan bancario de la globalización del sistema financiero. Pero, revelando sus mecanismos de acción y sus instituciones instrumentalizadas, el ciudadano puede ponerle fin a la estafa, el miedo, y el abuso, basado en la unión de los ciudadanos frente a banqueros y políticos (en algunos casos una misma cosa, ejemplo de las cajas españolas dirigidas por políticos, último caso Bankia y Rodrigo Rato), la coordinación y la rebeldía cívica pacífica, y la coordinación de acciones legales contra los responsables por vía judicial, tal como hizo ver Islandia. Y, en últimas instancias, proceder al retirar el capital de los bancos y, como nación soberana, forzar a los gobiernos negarse a devolver el crédito de deuda ilegítima, un dinero ficticio. Finalmente, instar a legislar la emisión de din

Archena -:- El Balneario de Archena reabre sus instalaciones con un nuevo programa que incluye los beneficios terapéuticos de las aguas termales y técnicas de recuperación psicológica El Balneario de Archena reabre sus instalaciones con un nuevo programa que incluye los beneficios terapéuticos de las aguas termales y técnicas de recuperación psicológica (18/03/2021) Tras su cierre el pasado 11 de enero debido a las restricciones impuestas por el Gobierno Regional por la crisis pandémica, Balneario de Archena ha abierto sus puertas hoy. Durante este tiempo, ha trabajado en la creación de nuevos programas termales y en el refuerzo de la seguridad. Los responsables de la entidad termal le han presentado a la primera regidora municipal, Patricia Fernández, el nuevo programa 'Psicotermal' que pondrán en marcha en esta nueva etapa. El Psicotermal es un tratamiento integral que incluye los beneficios terapéuticos de los programas termales y técnicas de recuperación psicológica. Con este programa, el complejo termal quiere ayudar a sus clientes a paliar tanto los efectos psicológicos de la Covid- 19, como esos síntomas que se mantienen en el tiempo y que hoy conocemos como Covid persistente, como la fatiga, el cansancio y los dolores musculo esqueléticos. Patricia Fernández ha afirmado tras su visita que "el Balneario es un referente nacional y regional, por tanto es un gran día para Archena, ya que es la principal empresa de nuestra localidad, luego un pilar fundamental para el municipio, por lo que supone de generación de puestos de trabajo. Un día muy feliz hoy, por su reapertura". Este nuevo programa está pensado para la

Pared con ambiente sevillano Una pared con ambiente sevillano Si decidimos colocar este vinilo que presentamos hoy en alguna de las estancias o rincones de nuestra casa, podremos tener una pared con ambiente sevillano, un punto original y exclusivo que va a otorgar personalidad a nuestro hogar. Dentro de su amplio y variado catálogo, Teleadhesivo dispone de varias colecciones, entre ellas alguna dedicada a las más importantes ciudades españolas, en este caso Sevilla. Se trata de un vinilo ideal tanto para el comedor o salón como incluso para la cocina o el dormitorio. Asimismo, es muy apropiado para algún bar o comercio. Es un vinilo tipográfico, en el cual podemos ver los nombres de los lugares más importantes de la capital andaluza. Así, vemos que en él consta el distrito Este-Alcosa-Torreblanca, el de Los Remedios, el de Nervión, el de Cerro-Amate, el de La Palmera o el de Bellavista, antiguamente conocido como Barrio de la Salud. Como es de esperar, no podían faltar ni el casco antiguo de Sevilla ni sus dos barrios más carismáticos: el barrio de Triana y el barrio de la Macarena. Completan el vinilo el distrito Norte y el distrito Sur. Es un vinilo muy apropiado no sólo para quienes son oriundos de esta ciudad, sino también para todos aquéllos que la han visitado y que enseguida se han visto embargados por una fascinación especial por ella, ya que es muy cierto aquello de que Sevilla tiene un embrujo especial. Como casi siempre, encontraremos el vinilo en distintos tamaños, pudiendo elegir asimismo entre una extensa ga

The New Brighton: La majestuosidad del pasado que se rehúsa a morir - Grupo Milenio The New Brighton: La majestuosidad del pasado que se rehúsa a morir Magda Bárcenas Castro 21/02/16 1:10 AM 04/03/2018 Fiesta Nacional de la Vendimia: "La constelación del vino" sólo en Mendoza Caminaba por Sarmiento al 645 en microcentro cuando me encontré con una puerta que me transportó en el tiempo...de sello inglés y con una barra que me invitaba a sentarme a disfrutar la belleza de su entorno. The New Brighton, un templo a la exquisitez arquitectónica. Una joya que descubrí en Buenos Aires, uno de esos lugares de los que no quisiera salir nunca. Una cerveza negra y una sonrisa…la vida es tan hermosa. Soy de las que disfruto de esas pequeñas cosas…de lo simple. La reflexión se estaciona mejor cuando se escucha la delicada música de un pianista en vivo y una buena charla. La elegancia se nota: muebles de roble, un majestuoso vitral en el salón principal y el recorrido por su impecable pasillo lleno de vinos e impecables vidrieras con objetos de la época es la rutina. El entorno es único y su historia es fascinante: una boutique inglesa que años más tarde se convertiría en una mágica experiencia que hasta la fecha se conserva y hace sentir a quienes la visitan como reyes. Champagne, gastronomía internacional, cervezas de todo el mundo y aperitivos exóticos. Un rincón porteño que no pueden perderse. Excelente punto de encuentro para los amigos y parejas que quieran disfrutarse. Estuve casi tres horas admirando cada detalle, disfrutando de la belleza que el tiempo dejó y que se nieg

ACUERDO por el que se dan a conocer los resultados del estudio técnico de las aguas nacionales subterráneas del acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, en el Estado de Zacatecas, Región Hidrológico-Administrativa VII, Cuencas Centrales del Norte Que el 5 de diciembre de 2001, se publicó en el Diario Oficial de la Federación el "ACUERDO por el que se establece y da a conocer al público en general la denominación única de los acuíferos reconocidos en el territorio de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos, por la Comisión Nacional del Agua, y la homologación de los nombres de los acuíferos que fueron utilizados para la emisión de los títulos de concesión, asignación o permisos otorgados por este órgano desconcentrado", a través del cual, al acuífero objeto de este estudio técnico se le asignó el nombre oficial de Loreto, clave 3229, en el Estado de Zacatecas; Que a través del "ACUERDO por el que se da a conocer la ubicación geográfica de 371 acuíferos del territorio nacional, se actualiza la disponibilidad media anual de agua subterránea de 282 acuíferos, y se modifica, para su mejor precisión, la descripción geográfica de 202 acuíferos", publicado en el Diario Oficial de la Federación el 28 de agosto de 2009, se modificaron los límites del acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, en el Estado de Zacatecas, identificados con vértices de la poligonal simplificada en coordenadas geográficas que fueron determinadas con base en la versión magnética del Marco Geoestadístico Municipal 2000 del Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía y su base cartográfica escala 1:250,000, en coordenadas geográficas y NAD27 como Datum; Que el 4 de enero de 2018, se publicó en el Diario Oficial de la Federación el "ACUERDO por el que se actualiza la disponibilidad media anual de agua subterránea de los 653 acuíferos de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos, mismos que forman parte de las Regiones Hidrológico-Administrativas que se indican", en el que se actualizó la disponibilidad media anual del acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, en el Estado de Zacatecas, obteniéndose un déficit de 48.350774 millones de metros cúbicos anuales, con fecha de corte en el Registro Público de Derechos de Agua al 31 de diciembre de 2015; Que en el acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, en el Estado de Zacatecas, se encuentran vigentes los siguientes instrumentos jurídicos: a) "DECRETO que establece veda por tiempo indefinido para el alumbramiento de aguas del subsuelo en la zona del Estado de Zacatecas, que comprende la cuenca media del río Aguanaval y otros", publicado en el Diario Oficial de la Federación el 16 de mayo de 1960, cuyas disposiciones aplican en el área suroccidental del acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, y b) "DECRETO por el que se declara de interés público la conservación de los mantos acuíferos en los Municipios de Noria de Ángeles, Pinos, etc., ubicados en el Estado de Zacatecas", publicado en el Diario Oficial de la Federación el 9 de febrero de 1978, cuyas disposiciones aplican en la mayor parte de la extensión del acuífero Loreto, clave 3229; Que el acuífero referido, se encuentra completamente vedado por los Decretos anteriores; no obstante, dichos instrumentos regulatorios no han sido suficientes para lograr revertir la problemática que a lo largo de estos años ha enfrentado el acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, aunado a las condiciones hidrológicas que se precisan en el presente estudio técnico, y la gran demanda de aguas subterráneas, principalmente para uso agrícola que hay en la región; Que la Comisión Nacional del Agua, con fundamento en los artículos 38, párrafo primero de la Ley de Aguas Nacionales, en relación con el diverso 73 de su Reglamento, ha procedido a formular el estudio técnico del acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, en el Estado de Zacatecas, con el propósito de determinar si es necesario modificar el marco regulatorio vigente en materia de control de la explotación, uso o aprovechamiento de las aguas nacionales del subsuelo, conforme a las causales de utilidad e interés público, previstas en la propia Ley, y en su caso, sustentar la emisión del ordenamiento procedente, mediante el cual se establezcan los mecanismos para su regulación, que permitan llevar a cabo su administración y uso sustentable; Que para la elaboración del estudio técnico, se promovió la participación de los usuarios a través del Consejo de Cuenca del Altiplano, a quienes se les presentaron los resultados de los mismos en la Décima Reunión Ordinaria de su Comisión de Operación y Vigilancia, celebrada el día 30 de junio de 2017, en la Ciudad de Zacatecas, en el Estado de Zacatecas, por lo que he tenido a bien expedir el siguiente: AGUAS NACIONALES SUBTERRÁNEAS DEL ACUÍFERO LORETO, CLAVE 3229, EN EL ESTADO DE ARTÍCULO ÚNICO.- Se dan a conocer los resultados del estudio técnico realizado en el acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, ubicado en el Estado de Zacatecas, en los términos siguientes: El acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, se localiza en la porción suroriental del Estado de Zacatecas, entre el límite con el Estado de Aguascalientes (Mapa 1), con una superficie aproximada de 689 kilómetros cuadrados; la cual comprende parcialmente los municipios de Loreto, Noria de Ángeles y González Ortega; así como pequeñas áreas de los municipios de Ojocaliente, Villa García y Luis Moya. Administrativamente pertenece a la Región Hidrológico-Administrativa VII, Cuencas Centrales del Norte. Los límites del acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, están definidos por los vértices de la poligonal simplificada cuyas coordenadas geográficas se presentan a continuación y corresponden a las establecidas en el "ACUERDO por el que se da a conocer la ubicación geográfica de 371 acuíferos del territorio nacional, se actualiza la disponibilidad media anual de agua subterránea de 282 acuíferos, y se modifica, para su mejor precisión, la descripción geográfica de 202 acuíferos", publicado en el Diario Oficial de la Federación el 28 de agosto de 2009: ACUÍFERO LORETO, CLAVE 3229 DEL 10 AL 11 POR EL LIMITE ESTATAL DEL 11 AL 12 POR EL LIMITE ESTATAL Para mayor precisión se ilustra en el siguiente mapa, la ubicación del acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, en el Estado de Zacatecas: De acuerdo con los datos publicados por el Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía Censo 2000, Conteo 2005 y la Proyección de Población 2005-2050 del Consejo Nacional de Población, la población circunscrita al acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, es de 51,234 habitantes. Las principales localidades urbanas que se ubican dentro del límite del acuífero son: Loreto, Villa González Ortega, Estancia de Ánimas, San Marcos, Tierra Blanca y Maravillas. Del total de la población, el 64 por ciento es urbana y 36 por ciento rural. La ciudad de Loreto, es la principal localidad urbana, la cual concentra el 43 por ciento del total de la población que habita en la superficie del acuífero. Las coberturas promedio de agua potable y alcantarillado de las localidades de la región son de 88 y 73 por ciento, para localidades urbanas y rurales, respectivamente. El sector agrícola es el principal usuario del agua subterránea, que extrae el 90.4 por ciento del volumen total en el acuífero Loreto, clave 3229. Para el periodo comprendido entre los años 2013 a 2015, se reportaron un promedio de 32,210 hectáreas por año bajo explotación agrícola; de las cuales 9,933 hectáreas, equivalentes al 27.7 por ciento son de riego, y 23,276 hectáreas son de temporal, las cuales representan el 72.3 por ciento. En términos de valor de la producción, aun cuando la superficie de agricultura de riego es aproximadamente 2.5 veces menor a la de temporal, representa el 88 por ciento del valor total de la producción. La superficie que se siembra bajo riego equivale al 6 por ciento de la superficie de riego en el Estado. Con base en su extensión, los principales cultivos cíclicos son maíz, frijol, lechuga y avena forrajera, mientras que entre los perennes, se ubica a la alfalfa como la de mayor importancia. Se estima que prácticamente el 94 por ciento de la superficie regada, se emplea para cultivos cíclicos, y el 6 por ciento restante por los perennes. Para este último caso, la alfalfa representa por sí sola el 81 por ciento de la superficie regada para cultivos perennes. De acuerdo con la clasificación de Köppen, modificada por Enriqueta García en 1964 para las condiciones de la República Mexicana, en el acuífero prevalece el clima seco estepario BS, que corresponde con el más seco de este tipo de climas, subtipo semiseco con grado de humedad mayor que 22.9. La temporada de lluvia se concentra en verano, la máxima precipitación cae dentro del periodo mayo-octubre, su porcentaje de lluvia invernal varía entre 5 y 10.2 y se caracteriza por presentar una temperatura media anual que varía entre 18 y 22 grados Centígrados. Para la determinación de las variables climatológicas se tomaron en cuenta los registros obtenidos para diferentes periodos de años, el más grande de 1963 a 2012 y el más corto de 2004 a 2012, con esta información se determinaron valores de precipitación, temperatura y evaporación potencial media anual de 397.4 milímetros, 17.1 grados centígrados y 2 056.5 milímetros, respectivamente. El área que comprende el acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, se ubica en su extensión total dentro de la Provincia Fisiográfica Mesa Central. Por otro lado, de acuerdo con la regionalización fisiográfica del Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía (INEGI, 1981), el acuífero se ubica en las Provincias Fisiográficas Mesa del Centro, la mayor parte en la Subprovincia Llanuras de Ojuelos-Aguascalientes y la porción norte en la Subprovincia Llanuras y Sierras Potosino-Zacatecanas. Los sistemas de topoformas que se presentan en la zona corresponden a un extenso llano de piso rocoso, limitado en su porción norte por bajadas aluviales, al poniente por lomeríos de pie de monte con mesetas, al suroeste se presenta una sierra baja con mesetas, al oriente se observa una pequeña sierra abrupta y al sureste los rasgos corresponden a una mesa extensa. En el extremo sur existe un puerto topográfico labrado en rocas riolíticas y en la porción nororiental las sierras no son continuas, y en ella existen angostas llanuras que comunican con otras planicies. Las mayores elevaciones se presentan en la región noroccidental, en el Cerro La Biznaga, con una elevación de 2,400 metros sobre el nivel del mar, y en las sierras de Asientos y de San Marcos, donde se presentan elevaciones del orden de 2,500 metros sobre el nivel del mar. La altura del llano oscila entre 2,030 y 2,100 metros sobre el nivel del mar y está orientado en dirección preferencial norte-sur. La sierra localizada en la porción occidental, tiene forma alargada orientada norte-sur y su elevación aproximada es de 2,300 metros sobre el nivel del mar. En la porción norte, cerca del poblado Pastoría, se encuentra una elevación topográfica dentro de la sierra, la cual corresponde a un intrusivo granítico. En la porción centro-sur se presentan materiales de pie de monte, que conforman lomeríos redondeados de suave pendiente. En la porción sureste se encuentra una sierra formada esencialmente por rocas de composición riolítica, las cuales presentan formas relativamente suaves. Al norte, las elevaciones topográficas corresponden a afloramientos de calizas y lutitas, en forma de lomeríos redondeados de pendientes suaves, separados por llanuras aluviales. El marco geológico regional está representado por los eventos relacionados con el establecimiento de la Sierra Madre Occidental y la evolución del Terreno Guerrero, que fue definido por Campa (1983), que presentan características litoestratigráficas diferentes. De esta manera, del Terreno Guerrero se presentan unidades metamorfizadas de edad Cretácico, y unidades de origen volcánico del Terciario, pertenecientes a la Sierra Madre Occidental. Completan la columna unidades de edad cuaternaria que consisten en basaltos y materiales aluviales. A nivel regional, la unidad más antigua corresponde al Triásico Superior y está conformada por una secuencia de rocas metamórficas y metasedimentarias que presentan metamorfismo de bajo grado en facies de esquistos verdes, conocida como Formación Zacatecas. Al sureste aflora una secuencia vulcanosedimentaria metamorfizada en facies de esquistos verdes, que aflora en el distrito minero de Tepezalá, donde cabalga a rocas del Cretácico Inferior, cuya edad se asigna al Jurásico Superior y se denomina Formación Cieneguitas (Dávila, 1988). Sobre ella descansa concordantemente la unidad nombrada informalmente como Formación El Varal (Velasco, 1989), conformada por calizas y lutitas con bandas y nódulos de pedernal; ambas unidades afloran de manera aislada en forma de ventanas estructurales, presentan metamorfismo regional de bajo grado y están intrusionadas por un tronco diorítico de edad Cretácico Inferior. Del Jurásico aflora una secuencia calcárea marina depositada en un ambiente nerítico, de aguas tranquilas, perteneciente a la Formación Zuloaga, sobreyacida concordantemente por una secuencia calcárea, depositada en un ambiente de escasa energía, correspondiente a la Formación La Caja. Del Cretácico existen pequeños afloramientos de la Formación Taraises, constituida por una altern

En el 2021 se han presentado un gran número de relojes para correr. De entre todos ellos, hemos elegido el mejor reloj Suunto para correr del 2021. La empresa Suunto lleva muchos años en el mercado de los relojes GPS y pulsómetros para correr, por lo que son cada vez más los runners que utilizan uno de sus relojes. Son fiables, resistentes, duraderos, innovadores y a precio asequibles para la calidad que aportará a tus entrenamientos Si hay que elegir un reloj GPS Suunto como el mejor del 2021 sería sin lugar a dudas el Suunto 7. Considerar el mejor reloj para correr al Suunto 7 no es una decisión tomada al azar, es porque este pulsómetro incorpora todas las funcionalidades buscadas para medir las variables de los entrenamientos, pero también lo puede utilizar como un smartwatch en tu día a día, pues incorpora utilidades como Google Play. Decir que el Suunto 7 es el mejor de la marca no es una invención, por la relación calidad-precio cumple de sobras con la expectativas que pueda tener un corredor. No sube tanto de precio como el Suunto 9 Baro, y respecto a las prestaciones supera por descontado al Suunto 5. Hay que admitirlo: se trata de un reloj Suunto barato para todas las funcionalidaded que incorpora. Suunto 5 Reloj deportivo GPS ligero y compacto con Monitor de... 140,97 EUR Comprar en Amazon Suunto 7 Smartwatch con aplicaciones versátiles y Wear OS de... 479,00 EUR 299,00 EUR Comprar en Amazon Suunto 9 Baro Reloj deportivo GPS con batería de larga duración... 599,00 EUR 286,47 EUR Comprar en Amazon Lo que convierte a este modelo en el mejor reloj Suunto para correr son las funcionalidades, la duración de batería batería y su diseño. Empezando por las funcionalidades, nos encontramos con un reloj con las siguientes características: Puedes descargarte música para escucharla sin conexión mientras corres. Usarás como un smartwatch, al tener incorporadas varias apps, que te permitirán pagar con el reloj, ver quién te llama o saber cuando es tu próxima reunión. Medición de todas las variables que afectan al rendimiento, como calidad del sueño, pulsaciones y tiempo de recuperación. Posibilidad de descargar de manera gratuita rutas de entrenamiento. Duración de batería hasta 12 horas con GPS activado. Diseño del Suunto 7 La estética es un factor muy importante para la marca Suunto, y todos sus relojes mantienen un diseño limpio, pero completo. El Suunto 7 no parecerá un reloj para correr, y lo podrás utilizar en tu día a día a modo de smartwatch. Con el Suunto 7 te encuentras con un reloj con una pantalla grande, pero cómoda, y muy ligera (el reloj solo pesa 70 gramos). La correa es de silicona, es muy flexible y no provoca enrojecimiento por el sudor, por lo que casi ni la notas. Suunto 9 Baro: la alternativa para la larga distancia Es cierto que el Suunto 7 es el mejor reloj GPS Suunto y es un reloj Suunto barato, en cuanto a que por un precio no demasiado elevado aporta muy buenas características, pero si buscas un reloj con una batería de larga duración y resistente, pero ligero, tu reloj es el Suunto Baro 9. La batería es uno de los principales puntos diferenciales entre el Suunto 9 Baro y el Suunto 7, y es que según la marca es capaz de aguantar hasta 24 horas con el GPS activado y 120 horas en modo ultra, por lo que es ideal para los corredores de montaña o de larga distancia. Otra característica a destacar es el tamaño de la esfera, mayor en el Suunto 9 Baro que en el Suunto 7, por lo que puedes controlar los dato

Noticias Valledupar: Colegios, Jornada académica, matriculas | Alerta Caribe Solo la mitad de los estudiantes se han matriculado en relación al 2020 La secretaria de salud teme que que haya deserción escolar en 2021. El regreso a clases en Valledupar como esperaban las autoridades, ha sido tardío. A la fecha solo 46.607 estudiantes culminaron el proceso de matrícula para el 2021. Preocupa a las autoridades que a pesar de la socialización del modelo de alternancia hay cierta negación por parte de los padres quienes no están seguros del inicio de clases en plena pandemia. "Este año siento que comenzó igual, o quizás peor. La verdad a veces prefiero que siga en casa, no he matriculado a mi hijo porque considero que hay que esperar a ver cómo avanzan los dos primeros meses" , dijo Johana Mendoza, habitante de Valledupar. Lea también: Lanzan aplicativo para rastrear a pacientes covid-19 en Valledupar Cabe destacar que según la secretaria de educación esperan que al finalizar el periodo de matrículas en este mes de enero alcancen los 86 mil estudiantes en las Instituciones Educativas públicas de la capital del Cesar. "Están pendientes 30.242 escolares que no han finalizado su proceso de matrícula, los padres familia a un no se acercan a los planteles a definir el año académico de sus hijos, pedimos que se agilice el proceso para darle curso al año escolar, por supuesto con todas la medidas que requiere la pandemia por covid 19", dijo el Secretario de Educación Local Iván Bolaños. Según la autoridad de educación otro de los motivos que disminuyo el número de matrículas legalizadas

▷Mejoras para el sector minero argentino - El Economista Mejoras para el sector minero argentino Un informe de la Secretaría de Minería, ahora en manos de Carolina Sánchez, destacó las mejoras en la actividad en los últimos años. El relevamiento realizado por la Subsecretaría de Desarrollo Minero resaltó que "uno de los mayores indicadores de crecimiento en la actividad es el número de perforaciones realizadas en materia exploratoria", que en el período 2015-18 se concentró principalmente en la búsqueda de oro, uranio, cobre y litio. Con respecto a las perforaciones, el informe resaltó que las efectuadas por las compañías del sector pasó de 244 en 2015 a 1.000 el año pasado, lo cual representó un salto de 310%. En el caso del oro, las tareas de perforación crecieron 2.200% y permitieron "extender la vida útil de las operaciones mineras e incrementar los recursos en proyectos avanzados", explicó el informe. Sobre el millar de perforaciones mineras totales desarrolladas en 2018, las orientadas a futuros hallazgos de vetas auríferas fueron 459, frente a las 206 del año anterior y apenas 20 durante 2015. Por su parte, las perforaciones en búsqueda de uranio se incrementaron 1.000% y el avance en las de cobre fue de 30% (para recategorizar recursos en proyectos avanzados), agregó el relevamiento oficial. El litio, en tanto, "fue uno de los principales objetivos en 20172018", mien

The Boys – Smash the hater eusantis Sin categoría 7 agosto, 2019 7 agosto, 2019 2 Minutes Vista The Boys, para mi gusto la mejor serie del momento. Aunque el final es puro "cliffhanger". Y eso, en una serie de tan pocos episodios, es algo negativo, no positivo. Porque a lo que se prestan las series de temporadas de tan pocos episodios es a hacer historias redondas.Y por eso The Boys no es una serie redonda. Es la última vuelta de tuerca al género superheroico, una serie basada en unos cómics que desconocía (no soy fan de los cómics en general), que en la pantalla se convierte en algo fresco y por momentos sorprendente dentro de ese género. Y desde luego, con ganas de ver más, que es de lo que se trata. Hasta que la fórmula se agote. Que se agote antes o después, claro, dependerá de lo buenos que sean los guiones de las siguientes temporadas, en si de verdad hay algo que contar, y no es todo una sucesión de violencias sin ton ni son. Como en toda serie donde el arco argumental de fondo importa poco, como esta, lo importante es que haya personajes carismáticos, de los que quieras saber más, eso, más allá de la novedad que supone en el género, es el punto fuerte de The Boys. Si se quiere rascar un poco más, y ver en esta serie una metáfora del baile entre la economía, el poder y la guerra, del que se vanagloriaba con terrible cinismo un premio Nobel de la Paz como Henry Kissinger… Pues sí, seguramente podamos comprar eso también. Así que algo de fondo hay, después de todo. Mención aparte, no he leído nada sobre ello, pero me lo imagino, el controvertido personaje de Profundo. ¿Un violador redimido? La de barbaridades que se tienen que estar soltando de esta serie, solo por eso. Ojo, no es que el personaje se redima, su historia queda colgada también, como todo en esta temporada. Pero al margen de por donde vayan los tiros en la siguiente, el personaje mola. Y de Patriota no diremos nada. Su actor merece varios premios de esos. Aprovecho la oportunidad para comentar lo estúpido que me parece que en determinados sitios de Internet se hable de la serie en castellano nombrando a sus personajes en ingl

Una VPN no solo enmascara su ubicación, sino que también encripta la conexión y hace que sea casi imposible para los forasteros rastrear lo que está navegando. Además, dependiendo de dónde se encuentre el servidor VPN, puede acceder fácilmente a sitios web con restricciones geográficas. Hay varios servicios de VPN, tanto gratuitos como de pago. Sin embargo, el único problema al que siempre me enfrento cuando utilizo estos servicios VPN de terceros es que son bastante lentos. Por ejemplo, tengo una conexión decente de 30 Mbps en mi casa. Pero, cuando me conecto a un servicio de VPN de terceros, la velocidad de conexión se reduce a entre 1 y 5 Mbps. Una de las razones de esto es que los servicios VPN almacenan a tantas personas como sea posible en un solo servidor y todos esos usuarios deben compartir el ancho de banda disponible. Además, cuando utiliza un servicio VPN de terceros, no tiene control sobre cómo utilizan los datos que recopilan sobre usted. Para hacer frente a todo esto, puede cómo configurar su propio servidor VPN en el poder y conectarse a él. Tenga en cuenta que crear su propio servidor VPN no es gratis. Como mínimo, debe pagar $ 5 por mes por servidor, lo que le brinda 1 TB de ancho de banda mensual. Ahora, quiero que la creación de VPN sea lo más simple posible para que incluso un usuario principiante que nunca haya creado o tratado con la nube pueda sentirse cómodo. Por esa razón, estoy usando Vultr. Esto se debe a que Vultr ofrece una imagen OpenVPN preconfigurada que facilita la creación de su propio servicio VPN. Siga los pasos a continuación tal como están y debería tener su propio servidor VPN en minutos. Leer: Explicación del protocolo VPN – PPTP vs L2TP vs SSTP vs IKEYv2 vs OpenVPN Página de administración de OpenVPN Palabras de cierre: Sconfigura tu propio servidor VPN Primero, regístrese para obtener una cuenta Vultr. Después de eso, vaya a la pantalla principal y seleccione las opciones de «Servidor» en el panel izquierdo. A continuación, haga clic en el icono «+» que aparece en la esquina superior derecha. Serás llevado a la pantalla de configuración del servidor. Primero, seleccione el país en el que desea que esté ubicado su servidor. En mi caso, como quiero que mi VPN tenga una dirección IP de Estados Unidos, estoy seleccionando la ubicación de Nueva York. Vultr tiene una imagen predefinida para crear su propio servidor VPN. Lo que simplemente significa que no tiene que pasar por todo el esfuerzo de configurar manualmente el servidor, instalar todo el software relacionado con VPN y configurarlo. Entonces, vaya a la pestaña «Aplicaciones» y seleccione la opción «OpenVPN». El siguiente paso es seleccionar el tamaño del servidor. Dado que el servidor de $ 5 ofrece 1TB de ancho de banda, es suficiente para la mayoría. Entonces, seleccione el servidor de $ 5. Si desea más ancho de banda, también puede seleccionar otros tamaños. Puede dejar todas las demás configuraciones como están. En la parte inferior de la página, puede nombrar su servidor. Asígnele el nombre que desee y haga clic en el botón «Implementar ahora». La configuración del servidor puede llevar unos minutos. Dado que seleccionamos una imagen OpenVPN preconfigurada, el servidor se configura automáticamente en segundo plano. Una vez que el servidor esté instalado y configurado correctamente, verá «En ejecución» en la sección «Estado». Dado que el servidor está preconfigurado para usar OpenVPN, se crea un nombre de usuario y una contraseña de administrador de VPN para usted. Haga clic en el nombre del servidor y encontrará la dirección IP de inicio de sesión, el nombre de usuario y la contraseña del panel de administración de OpenVPN justo debajo de los detalles del servidor. El mismo nombre de usuario y contraseña se envían a su dirección de correo electrónico. Nota: Tenga en cuenta que el nombre de usuario y la contraseña de OpenVPN so

«Afortunadamente, la fuente es evocadora del automovilismo, hay una especie de aspecto retro en ella. «Nosotros intentamos pensar en formas de letras diferenciadas, de modo que un evento emergente o inmersivo tenga una identidad». Para el proceso de selección y creación del nuevo logo, elaboraron todo tipo de bocetos, varias versiones de logotipos muy interesantes hasta llegar a la simpleza de utilizar una F y un 1, de manera que se sintiese en movimiento y a la vez moderno Estamos ante un logotipo muy diferente a su antecesor, el reconocible logo de Formula 1, más estático y firme en sus proporciones. Conserva el tono rojo intenso de su anterior diseño, aplicable a todo su merchandising, lo que permite que la identidad se unifique y logre un esfuerzo por posicionar esta nueva marca.

Mrk.Borja: Nuevo Amazon Kindle Fire HD Esto se anima, llega la Navidad y nos trae muchos juguetitos para los amantes de lo tecnológico y avanzado y es que Kindle Fire HD ya está desde hoy disponible para enviar en España. El Kindle Fire HD se presenta en tamaños de 7 y 8.9 pulgadas, con mejoras en el hardware, el software y especialmente en la pantalla, donde hay que destacar los datos del modelo de 8.9 pulgadas con una genial resolución de 1920×1200 píxeles que dan 254 dpi (puntos por pulgada, una medida cada vez más común a la hora de medir las resoluciones). Pasemos a ver con detalle las características técnicas de estos nuevos Kindle Fire HD. Nuevos Kindle Fire HD, características técnicas La base de los nuevos Kindle Fire HD es común en los modelos de 7 y 8.9 pulgadas. Estos tablets cuentan con un procesador de doble núcleo Texas Instruments OMAP 4470 (que según Amazon mejora el rendimiento de Tegra 3 en un 50%) a 1.5 Ghz (el modelo de 7 pulgadas se queda en un 4460 a 1.2 Ghz) y tecnología de doble banda (5 y 2.4 Ghz) MIMO que mejorará la señal. Según la compañía consiguen tasas de transferencias un 41 y 54% mejores que iPad 3 y Nexus 7. Kindle Fire HD también tendrá Bluetooth y salida HDMI El modelo básico parte de los 16 GB de capacidad interna debido a que Amazon quiere potenciar el consumo de contenido en alta definición, y hay también de 32 y 64 GB. En cuanto a las pantallas, la resolución del modelo de 7 pulgadas es de 1280 × 800 píxeles y viene con filtro polarizado y tecnología antirreflectante. El Kindle Fire HD de 8.9 pulgadas sube su apuesta hasta los 1080p en resolución, con panel IPS y táctil de hasta 10 puntos. El Amazon Kindle HD de 8.9 pulgadas se presenta con un grosor de sólo 8.8 milímetros y peso de unos 567 gramos aproximadamente, mientras que el de 7 pulgadas tiene unas dimensiones oficiales de 19.3 × 13.7 × 10.3 cm, con un peso de 395 gramos. Amazon Kindle Fire HD de 8.9 pulgadas En el apartado del audio, olvidado según Amazon por muchos fabricantes, el Kindle Fire HD será estéreo y contará con la certificación Dolby Digital Plus, posiblemente pensando en ofrecer una calidad de sonido superior de cara a su tienda de música. En EEUU contarán con un modelo de Kindle Fire HD de 8.9 pulgadas con conectividad LTE, que con un pago de 50 dólares una vez, te garantiza 250 MB de datos al mes para siempre. La idea no es mala, pero esa cifra es ridícula para un tabl

Cuando estén las papas bien tiernas, sáquelas y escúrralas en un escurridor. Llévelas nuevamente a la olla y añada la leche a los pocos mientras usted usa un tenedor para aplastar y mezclar las papas hasta que alcance la textura deseada. Le sugerimos 35 ml de leche entera, pero eso depende de lo cremoso que usted quiera que quede el puré, por eso, vaya agregando la leche lentamente. La mantequilla se incorporará después, por eso, solo ajuste la sal del puré y déjelo aparte mientras hacemos la carne. Corte la carne en trozos, condimente con sal y pimienta y déjela aparte mientras calentamos la sartén.

Jaén subastará el tranvía tras fracasar la oferta de Ferrocarriles de Cataluña | Andalucía | EL PAÍS Jaén subastará el tranvía tras fracasar la oferta de Ferrocarriles de Cataluña El alcalde dice que entregará las llaves a Griñán si persiste el desinterés empresarial 28 ENE 2013 - 20:10 CET Ampliar foto Presentación del tranvía de Jaén en diciembre de 2010. josé manuel pedrosa Lo ha reconocido el alcalde, José Enrique Fernández de Moya: el de Jaén es "el tranvía a ninguna parte". Lo que era un secreto a voces no ha hecho más que confirmarse: el sistema tranviario jiennense, paralizado desde mayo de 2011 antes de su estreno, seguirá en punto muerto, y lo más probable es que lo haga de modo indefinido a pesar de haberse invertido en él más de 100 millones de euros. El Ayuntamiento jiennense sacará a concurso la explotación del tranvía después de fracasar la oferta planteada por Ferrocarriles de la Generalitat de Cataluña (FGC), que supeditaba su gestión a que hubiera ayuda municipal, algo que el alcalde ha rechazado de plano. Y si, como se teme, no hay ninguna otra empresa que opte a la licitación, el regidor de Jaén lo tiene claro: "Al día siguiente iré a San Telmo a entregarle las llaves del tranvía al presidente Griñán". El gobierno municipal, del PP, ha esperado a conocer la auditoria presentada por la empresa pública catalana para confirmar su nulo interés por reactivar el tranvía. Este sistema de transporte fue la bandera electoral de la anterior alcaldesa socialista, Carmen Peñalver. Fernández de Moya siempre ha renegado del tren ligero. Según el estudio económico de FGC, presentado ayer por el alcalde, el coste anual del tranvía sería de cinco millones de euros. De esta cantidad, 3,3 millones corresponden a gastos de explotación y los 1,7 millones restantes, al pago a la Junta de los cinco vagones. Si se tiene en cuenta que la recaudación prevista por el número de viajeros sería de 1,3 millones (estimando el billete a un euro), el coste neto sería de 3,7 millones. La empresa pública catalana incluso apunta que solo utilizaría tres de los cinco vagones (dos de lunes a viernes, y uno para l

Lejos del equipo que maravilló al continente levantando la Eurocopa en julio, Italia jugó bajo una gran presión, firmando un partido decepcionante, en el que sin embargo tuvo algunas ocasiones, solventadas sin problemas por el arquero norirlandés Bailey Peacock-Farrell, a imagen del disparo de Federico Chiesa en el 38. "Tuvimos problemas para marcar a pesar de dominar el juego. Es una pena porque tuvimos ocasiones en la primera parte para desbloquear el partido rápido y jugar más tranquilos", lamentó Mancini. Para endurecer el 'via crucis', Suiza marcó el tanto que le daba la clasificación virtual al principio del segundo tiempo (48), cuando un gran centro de Xherdan Shaqiri lo cabeceó con clase Noah Okafor.

Habían estado con Jesús todo el día escuchándolo enseñar a multitudes. Se hacía de noche y el Señor les dijo: “Crucemos al otro lado del lago” (Mrc. 4, v. 35). Disfrutaban de una tranquila y silenciosa navegación. Jesús agarró una almohada y se fue a dormir en la punta de la barca. De repente una gran tormenta se desató en el medio del mar. Había otras barcas cerca. Los vientos eran tan fuertes y las olas tan altas que creyeron hundirse. Los discípulos despertaron a Jesús con un grito desesperado: “¡Maestro! ¿No te importa que nos ahoguemos?” (v. 38). ¿Te has sentido así alguna vez? ¿Experimentaste en tu corazón tal turbulencia que creíste que te ahogabas? Podemos atravesar tormentas intensas o pequeños chaparrones, el tamaño del problema depende de nuestra perspectiva. El caso es que, a menudo, al igual que los discípulos necesitamos desesperadamente de la paz que sólo Dios nos puede dar. Isaías profetiza sobre el niño que vendría, el Hijo de Dios, y lo llama “Príncipe de Paz”. Príncipe, según el diccionario, es el “hijo del rey que es heredero de la corona”. El príncipe dispone de los bienes del padre. Jesús, nuestro Príncipe de paz dijo en Juan 14:27 (NTV) “Les dejo un regalo: paz en la mente y en el corazón. Y la paz que yo doy es un regalo que el mundo no puede dar. Así que no se angustien ni tengan miedo.” Los discípulos estaban al lado del dador de la paz pero sus corazones estaban repletos de miedo. Fue entonces que Jesús le habló al viento y a las olas: “¡Silencio! ¡Cálmense!” (v. 39). Inmediatamente la naturaleza obedeció y hubo completa paz. Jesús nos ofrece la paz de Dios, esa que sobrepasa todo entendimiento. Pero es cuestión de fe. El Señor les dijo a sus amigos: “¿Por qué tienen miedo? ¿Todavía no tienen fe?”. Isaías 26:3 y Fil. 4:6-7 nos anima a ir al Señor y permanecer en él, y como resultado su paz guardará nuestra mente y corazón. Algunos sinónimos de » guardar» son: defender, cuidar, custodiar, vigilar, velar, atender, esconder, asegurar, conservar. Eso puede hacer la paz de Dios en nuestra mente y corazón si tan sólo creemos y descansamos en el Príncipe de paz. ¡Qué, como el viento y las olas al escuchar a Jesús, tu corazón reciba su paz!

Las cooperativas eléctricas entrerrianas aún no rubricaron el contrato de concesión | Análisis Jueves, 28 Enero, 2021 - 13:06 Las cooperativas eléctricas entrerrianas aún no rubricaron el contrato de concesión 31 de Marzo de 2013 - 21:08 Según Farabello, oficialmente se había informado que la firma se concretaría en agosto. Pero hacia septiembre todavía esperaban ser convocados. "Originalmente la rúbrica se realizaría antes de que finalice el mes de agosto, pero claramente se ha demorado", expresaba el titular de FACE en diálogo con APF. La situación no varió demasiado desde ese entonces a la actualidad, explicó Farabello. "No se firmó todavía. No ha habido novedade

En el momento en el que haya sobrepoblación femenina o masculina, ésta norma será modificada por la administración. Así mismo, si deseas obtener una quinta cuenta, se recomienda pasar por el sistema de puntos. Allí podrás obtener mas información. ♦ El nombre de registro deberá ser correcto. Es decir, ésto es un foro de rol por lo que nombres como: Pepita_Rexulonah, PEPITA REXULONAH y cualquier variante, no serán aceptados. En cuanto la administración vea éste tipo de cuentas, serán borradas automáticamente sin previo aviso. Así mismo, las cuentas como "Pensando" o "Thinking" se dejarán por un periodo de cinco días, después de ésto, también serán borradas. ♦ Dado que es un foro de rol, el nombre de tu personaje deberá ser totalmente original. Es decir, si usas a Dylan O'Brien no le pongas a tu pj Dylan, tampoco Stiles ni ningún otro nombre de otra serie/película en la que salga. Hay que ser originales, por favor. Tampoco se aceptarán nombres de personajes de cómics, libros, series y cualquier otra cosa relacionada. Puede usar Damon para tu personaje, pero no Damon Salvatore aunque tu pb sea Hugh Jackman. ♦ La edad de los personajes dependerá del avatar que uses. Los avatares que superen los 30 años, se les podrá poner como máximo 24 años. Si tu avatar tiene 18 años, como máximo le podrás subir a 22. Si tienes dudas con ésto no dudes en consultar con el staff. ♦ Respeto. No cuesta nada tener un poco de educación y en el caso de tener un problema con la alguna user, hablarlo correctamente. Si la otra persona no cumple ésta norma no es necesario que te pongas a la misma altura. Sé educado y en el caso de no poder solucionarlo, la administración está a tu disposición para tomar cartas en el asunto. ♦ Aquellas personas que no tengan ausencia registrada en su respectivo lugar y se pase 25 días sin entrar en el foro o sin postear, perderá color y por tanto, el derecho sobre su pb y registros. En el caso de querer recuperar color, deberás realizar dos temas On-rol, avisar a la administración una vez realizados y cuando den el visto bueno, realizar de nuevo los registros. ♦ Las tablillas proporcionadas por la administración son obligatorias, exceptuando la tablilla de rol, relaciones y cronología. Lo único que se pide es que por favor, no se usen colores que desentonen con el foro. — Normas de Rol ♦ Como se ha comentado antes, el respeto es fundamental. Pero como es obvio, no todos los personajes se pueden llevar bien. Si ésto sucede y se lleva a cabo un rol donde tienen una pelea y se faltan el respeto, es obligatorio que primero se hable entre users. ♦ Los temas +18 están permitidos. Ésto incluye todos esos temas donde aparezca sexo, violencia o cualquier elemento que pueda dañar la sensibilidad del user. Es por ello que los temas con éstas características deberán tener en el título un +18.

Por otro lado, intenta no escribir De EsTa MaNeRa, es antiestetico. ♦ No hay mínimo de líneas para los post pero seamos coherentes, ésto es un foro de rol, no un chat. Intentemos evitar roles de una o dos líneas. Si se abusa de éstos roles puede que recibas un toque de atención. ♦ Los personajes no podrán ser asesinados on-rol sin el permiso de su respectivo user. A ésta norma se le añade el meta-rol. Intentemos no llevar a nuestro personaje y al del otro, no al menos sin el permiso del otro user. ♦ Si necesitas utilizar imagenes para ambientar el rol, está permitido.

La terapia de aceptación y compromiso - Psicoterapeutas Home La terapia de aceptación y compromiso En esta página se presenta la terapia de aceptación y compromiso como una avance de la terapia cognitivo conductual basándose en la teoría de los marcos relacionales y señala que existen dificultades en adaptar la práctica de esta terapia para los psicólogos cognitivo conductuales tradicionales. La terapia de aceptación y compromiso: No hay una buena práctica sin una buena teoría Además de la formación totalmente orientada a la práctica que se presenta en Psicoterapeutas.com, en el aspecto teórico se hace especial hincapié en laTerapia de Aceptación y Compromiso que recoge los últimos avances dentro del paradigma Cognitivo conductual. Se ha demostrado que el aprendizaje de la terapia de aceptación y compromiso cambia la forma de operar del psicólogo y aumenta su eficacia y la satisfacción del paciente. Por ejemplo, es el encuadre más eficaz para los tratamientos en los que se utiliza la exposición (trastorno obsesivo compulsivo, agorafobia, fobias, fobia social, depresión, etc.). La terap

Inicio Noticias de Venezuela Dos chamos desaparecidos de una fiesta el sábado, aparecieron sin vida en... Carlos Alberto Torres y Carlos Leonel Posada, de 27 y 24 años de edad respectivamente, asistieron a un local nocturno sin saber que sería la última vez que lo iban a pisar. Fueron vistos el 19 de marzo a eso de las 9 de la noche en el Barrio Primero de Mayo. Según compañeros de fiesta, iban a comprar unos perros calientes para cenar. Los dos hombres salieron en búsqueda de comida rápida para continuar con la fiesta, sin embargo, fueron asesinados en la madrugada. Luego de cometer el crimen, dejaron los dos cuerpos abandonados en Yogore. Este caserío está ubicado muy cerca del sitio donde se efectuó la fiesta, a unos 20 kilómetros.

VUELVEN LAS CLASES PRESENCIALES A ALGUNAS CARRERAS DE LA UNC | ESTACION FM :: LA RADIO DE TOTORAL :: SOMOS EL NORTE Inicio DESTACADO VUELVEN LAS CLASES PRESENCIALES A ALGUNAS CARRERAS DE LA UNC VUELVEN LAS CLASES PRESENCIALES A ALGUNAS CARRERAS DE LA UNC Después de casi un año y medio de virtualidad, la Universidad Nacional de Córdoba (UNC) recuperará en parte su actividad presencial en el segundo semestre de este año. Mientras la mayoría de las facultades se preparan para regresar a las aulas, aunque sea parcialmente, a partir de agosto, este lunes el Consejo Superior fijará para la tercera semana de octubre la fecha de la elección de autoridades en 15 facultades y de la renovación de los miembros del Consejo Superior. El segundo semestre arrancará con una mayor cantidad de clases presenciales en la Casa de Trejo luego de tres semestres de virtualidad casi permanente. En líneas generales, la participación está orientada a actividades prácticas, con burbujas, mientras que los teóricos continuarán de manera virtual. Y todo además estará supeditado a la evolución de la situación sanitaria global en la provincia. Si la tercera ola de coronavirus pega, puede que haya replanteos. NO SERÁ IGUAL EN TODAS "Nosotros decidimos empezar las clases presenciales este cuatrimestre con todos los protocolos necesarios. Pero los teóricos no volverán nunca más y continuarán de forma virtual", señaló el decano de la Facultad de Agronomía, Marcelo Conrero a La Voz. "Vamos a priorizar los ejercicios en laboratorios, talleres y los encuentros de actividades prácticas exclusivamente", agregó el decano, y apuntó que "para los exámenes los alumnos podrán elegir qué modalidad que prefieran: presencial o remota". Un concepto similar adoptará la Facultad de Ciencias Químicas que pondrá el énfasis en la presencialidad de las actividades más complejas. "Las clases van a continuar en formato virtual para todas las asignaturas pero por otra parte todas las materias de la carrera tendrán una actividad presencial. No va a ser condicionamiento de la regularidad porque tendrán una alternativa para realizar de forma remota", explicó el decano, Gustavo Chiabrando. Una propuesta que surge de esa facultad para cuando retornen las actividades es montar una suerte de Centro de Operaciones de Emergencia (COE) en Ciudad Universitaria para hacer un monitoreo y control en caso de que haya un brote. Por su parte, la decana de Psicología, Patricia Altamirano, señaló que las actividades se tienen que retornar con una razonabilidad sanitaria en cada contexto. "Volver a la presencialidad es imprescindible. Pero no hay una política general en la UNC para decidir sobre la presencialidad. En facultades masivas no tenemos condiciones par

"Una imputada pide el voto para Susana Díaz" "Una imputada pide el voto para Susana Díaz" Inicio Actualidad "Una imputada pide el voto para Susana Díaz" Andrés Lorite denuncia el vídeo de Dolores Amo en el que solicita el voto para la candidata socialista a presidir la Junta Ha sido en su cuenta oficial de Twitter, donde el portavoz del Grupo Popular en Diputación y número 5 del PP por Córdoba al Parlamento de Andalucía, Andrés Lorite, ha denunciado que Dolores Amo pida el voto para el PSOE. "Una imputada por presunto caso de corrupción pide el voto para Susana Díaz", ha publicado Lorite. Ello en referencia a la número dos de facto del Partido Socialista cordobés, Dolores Amo, que ha grabado un vídeo solicitando que se dé la confianza a la formación de la que es militante.

Desde la Unión Nacional de Clubes de Barrio (UNCB) calificaron el acto de «puesta en escena». «Hoy esperábamos estar felices por los que creímos iba a ser un anuncio reparador, reivindicador y justo, para los 20 mil clubes de barrio del país, pero lamentablemente no fue así.

Dover / I Ka Kené – jenesaispop.com Las hermanas Llanos le han debido de coger el gustillo a eso de reinventarse. Después de resurgir de sus propias cenizas con el pelo teñido, sonidos electrónicos, una clara fijación por Madonna y con 'Let Me Out' convertido en un single de éxito en todas las discotecas del país -y que incluso a día de hoy, después de reescucharlo, te apetece ponerte de nuevo-, ahora nos han salido con el africanismo por bandera, tal y como atestiguan la portada y el nombre de su nuevo trabajo: 'I Ka Kené'. El cambio es tan sorprendente que uno incluso comienza a preguntarse cómo convencen a las discográficas para que les publiquen sus nuevos discos. Y es que haciendo memoria no es difícil recordar que por muy mainstream que fueran (probablemente hasta tu madre supiera quién cantaba 'Devil Came To Me'), hubo un tiempo en el que se mantuvieron fieles a sus orígenes (y ahí está para recordarlo aquello de «DJ, don't do this to me»). Con sus fans de base posiblemente mirando ya para otro lado y ajenos a cualquier cosa que pueda venir de la banda madrileña, queda por ver cómo se tomarán su

EL CABALLO SE CONVIERTE EN UNA HERRAMIENTA TERAPÉUTICA PARA PROMOVER LA REHABILITACIÓN DE PERSONAS CON DISCAPACIDAD FÍSICA Y SENSORIAL, FELIX PANDO PIENSA EN COLORES Y MÚSICA PENSADA EN LOS CABALLOS Actualidad Por: Guillermo Sammartino 24 de noviembre de 2022 En ocasiones, los seres humanos mantienen con los animales una relación personal muy estrecha que les llega a cambiar la vida por completo. Este vínculo tan personal que se establece, incluso les mejora la salud. Por todo ello, los animales se vienen utilizando en terapias asistidas desde el siglo XIX. Y los caballos no son una excepción. Fue un neurólogo francés quien, en 1875, descubrió los beneficios que los equinos podían proporcionar a sus pacientes. Nació así en Europa la equinoterapia, una disciplina empleada por profesionales de la salud física o mental, con el objetivo de promover la rehabilitación de niños, adolescentes y adultos a nivel neuromuscular, psicológico, cognitivo y social, por medio del caballo como herramienta terapéutica. La medicina ha demostrado que la terapia con caballos favorece la calidad de vida de muchas personas. FELIX PANDO y la MUSICOTERAPIA La música es una experiencia sensorial que puede activar todas las áreas cerebrales simultáneamente. Por tanto, es útil en terapia porque dispara el funcionamiento del cerebro en el sentido emocional, cognitivo y físico. Con las nuevas investigaciones que surgen sobre la Musicoterapia, se ha demostrado que es útil tanto en rehabilitación, educación y en programas para la mejora del bienestar. Este tipo de terapia es efectiva para tratar ciertos trastornos o mejorar la calidad de vida del paciente, y actúa de dos maneras: activa (tocar instrumentos, cantar, interpretar la música) y receptiva (usar la música para inducir estados de relajación). También se utilizan otras técnicas y formas artísticas de forma simultánea a la música, como el arte dramático, la danza o la pintura. Entre las novedades de la músicoterapia, y sus efectos en personas (niños, adultos, mayores, patologías diversas, grupos sociales; pero esta semana, a colación de una noticia que se publicaba sobre un proyecto pionero de cría en cautividad de San Martiños en el Acuario de La Coruña, hemos pensado …. ¡hablemos de musicoterapia para animales! Aparece el músico argentino Felix Pando como uno de los mayores creadores y difusores en la materia. Pero antes de compartir todo su material musical, investigamos y nos preguntamos ¿Sufren estress los animales, se deprimen?. Evidentemente, si ¿Sienten dolor los animales cuando se hieren, cuando están enfermos?. Evidentemente, sí. Entonces, ¿Qué puede hacer la música por ellos?. ¿Hay programas de musicoterapia para animales?. Y la respuesta de nuevo es un rotundo: Si, claro que sí. La música también puede ayudar a los animales. – La musicoterapia es especialmente efectiva para reducir el nivel de estrés y ansiedad en animales domésticos (que puede elevarse cuando pasan mucho tiempo solos en casa, por ejemplo). En estos casos, la música logra reducir el ritmo del latido del corazón y ralentiza el ritmo de la respiración, lo que acaba por reducir la ansiedad. – La música es también una terapia ideal para rebajar los niveles de agresividad e hiperactividad de nuestras mascotas. – Existe un estudio realizado por la Queen´s University de Belfast, que ha sido publicado por la revista Animal Welfare, que demuestra que la música clásica es la favorita de perros, gatos Y caballos Las mascotas, nuestros compañeros inseparables aman la música de Felix Pando Felix Pando, un músico argentino radicado en Estados Unidos, ha publicado temas y álbumes con composiciones adaptadas para perros, gatos y pájaros de Beethoven, Chopin o Mozart, y los efectos son evidentes. A continuación algunos de sus temas y álbumes de musicoterapia EL PODER DE LA EQUINOTERAPIA -En el desarrollo de habilidades motoras. -En el tono muscular. -En la postura. -En la conducta. -En el ajuste emocional. Según aseguran los expertos, el movimiento que presenta el caballo es muy similar al patrón fisiológico de la marcha humana. Sobre todo, por esta razón es capaz de ayudar en el tratamiento de numerosas patologías cuando estas terapias se llevan a cabo a través de profesionales cualificados. La equinoterapia contempla una serie de varios tratamientos destinados a personas con ciertas discapacidades sensoriales autismo , parálisis cerebral, síndrome de Down, esclerosis múltiple, Parkinson...) que diferenciamos a continuación. SEIS TIPOS DE TERAPIAS QUE SE SUELEN REALIZAR CON CABALLOS: 1) Hipoterapia. Basada en el movimiento del equino, esta disciplina puede realizarse a lomos del caballo, o a su lado. Se basa en aspectos como la transmisión del calor corporal del cuerpo del animal a la persona y genera estímulos en el enfermo que le permiten mejorar la coordinación y el equilibrio. Un fisioterapeuta dirige la terapia. 2) Equitación terapéutica. Los problemas de aprendizaje y adaptación que algunas personas padecen pueden ser corregidas con esta técnica, que estimula la afectividad y los sentidos. Centra su atención en el contacto con el caballo y la motivación que este genera. El paciente asume el papel de responsable de los distintos cuidados que necesita el equino. 3) Equitación adaptada. Como su propio nombre indica, es la práctica de esta disciplina deportiva adaptada a personas con minusvalía física que requieren adaptaciones individuales para montar a caballo. 4) Volteo terapéutico. La clave de esta técnica reside en tener en cuenta sus efectos no solo fisioterapéuticos, sino también psicopedagógicos. El paciente monta al caballo únicamente sobre una manta para de esta forma poder realizar movimientos sobre su dorso. 5) Equinoterapia social. Con esta disciplina se aprovecha el vínculo afectivo que el humano establece con el caballo. La relación que se origina permite superar los conflictos de adaptación a la sociedad en la que vive. 6) Terapias ecuestres ocupacionales. Favorecer la inserción laboral de los discapacitados. Ese el fin que tiene esta técnica practicada con equinos. Y a base de un trabajo constante se acaba consiguiendo. Todas estas razones aquí expuestas demuestran los beneficios que la equinoterapia conlleva para la salud humana. Y para que el caballo pueda convertirse en esa herramienta esencial que mejora la capacidad cognitiva de los pacientes con problemas psicológicos, resulta esencial una alimentación correcta Caballos Felix Pando Felix Pando musician, composer, arranger and sound Horses Music Te puede interesar Tintes, mascarillas y otras utilidades que se pueden obtener de los residuos del café El café es una de las bebidas más consumidas a nivel mundial, es ese fiel amigo que suele acompañar a las personas, ya sea al empezar un nuevo día, en el trabajo cuando más activo se debe estar o en las noches frías donde se suele buscar una fuente de calor.

QATAR 2022 : Los goles de Messi y Enzo Fernández ante México Con dos golazos de Messi y Enzo Fernández en el segundo tiempo, la Selección consiguió el objetivo de conseguir los tres puntos tras el traspié del debut ante Arabia y ahora va por Polonia, el próximo miércoles. Messi, el genio apareció en Lusail para resucitar a Argentina Se acomodó el balón con el control y sacó un zurdazo seco pegado al poste para reventar la noche catarí en el majestuoso estadio de Lusail. Lionel Messi apareció en el momento justo para derrotar a México y resucitar a la selección argentina en el Mundial. Se registraron 3.323 nuevos contagios en el país, un 50% más que la semana pasada Además, hubo ocho muertes, dos más que las comunicadas el domingo último. ¿Intolerancia a la lactosa?

Omar Rojas, el ciclista con Parkinson que pedaleó de La Quiaca a Ushuaia "La bicicleta es mi medicina", dijo el sanjuanino de 57 años que partió de Jujuy el 20 de septiembre y llegó a Ushuaia el lunes 21 de noviembre. Rojas reveló que hace unos años, debido a la enfermedad, no caminaba y ni siquiera podía alimentarse por sus propias medios. Argentina sin Paredes y con cuatro cambios más para enfrentar a México Las variantes serán los ingresos de Lisandro Martínez, Gonzalo Montiel, Marcos Acuña, Enzo Fernández por Cristian Romero, Nahuel Molina, Nicolás Tagliafico y Alejandro Gómez, respectivamente.

Labocheck - análisis de agua: Activa tu metabolismo bebiendo agua antes del desayuno Lo cierto es que el responsable de nuestro cuerpo queme mayor o menor cantidad de calorías es nuestro metabolismo, de forma que cuanto más activo está, más calorías elimina. Una buena manera de mantener activo nuestro metabolismo es practicando algún tipo de ejercicio, que estimula la actividad de nuestro organismo incluso después de practicarlo. Pero el ejercicio no es lo único que activa nuestro metabolismo. La alimentación y otros hábitos saludables también influyen en dicha activación. Tras pasar toda la noche en reposo y sin beber, tomar un vaso de agua en ayunas es una buena forma de empezar el día. Con este sencillo gesto, además de hidratarnos, estamos despertando a nuestro organismo, dándole la señal de que puede comenzar a quemar calorías. Sin duda, tomar agua es una buena forma de poner en marcha nuestro metabolismo y preparar a nuestro cuerpo para el resto del día, pero beber agua en ayunas no ayuda a eliminar grasas del cuerpo. Sencillamente, se trata de un hábito que ayuda a hidratarnos y eliminar toxinas, que nunca debe sustituir al desayuno. Además, vale la pena recordar que beber agua ayuda a mantener la elasticidad de la piel, dándole un aspect

Vacaciones con Mario | Edición impresa | EL PAÍS Vacaciones con Mario El popular fontanero ha cumplido 20 años y visita el cubo de Nintendo con un juego de mensaje ecologista Mario Bros visita por primera vez el cubo de Nintendo, con gráficos en 3-D y mucha acción. El fontanero de mostacho prominente, vestido con el mono azul de trabajo y de figura más bien regordeta, ha cumplido 20 años. Fue en la década de 1980 cuando el genial Shigeru Miyamoto creó al gorila Donkey Kong y al fontanero, al que bautizó con el nombre de Jumpman, encargado de rescatar a su amada Pauline, secuestrada por el temible gorila. Con el tiempo Nintendo decidió cambiar el nombre de Jumpman por el de Mario, dicen que en honor al dueño del edificio donde se encontraba la sede de Nintendo America. A partir de ese momento Mario Bros se convirtió en todo un ídolo del mundo del videojuego; más de 165 millones de juegos vendidos en todo el mundo avalan su éxito. 'Super Mario Sunshine' Género: Plataformas Fabricante: Nintendo Plataforma: GameCube Precio: 54,95 euros Edad: Mayores de 3 años Internet: http://supermariosunshine.nintendo-europe.com www.nintendo-europe.com En 1982 protagoniza en solitario su primer videojuego. En compañía de su hermano Luigi debe limpiar las cloacas de la ciudad de una plaga de monstruos y alimañas. Se han hecho con su imagen películas, series de televisión, camisetas, llaveros, tazas e incluso botes de champú. Y ahora Mario Bros vuelve al ataque con este juego para la nueva consola de Nintendo titulado Super Mario Sunshine, del que ya se han vendido en Japón 400.000 títulos en cuatro días. Después de su última aventura Mario y Paulina necesitan un descanso y deciden volar hacia Isla Delfino, el paraíso de la tranquilidad y el relax. Pero Mario no podrá descansar y disfrutar de sus vacaciones: un malhechor se ha dedicado a ensuciar la isla de una pegajosa substancia parecida al petróleo. Además, el parecido del gamberro con Mario es bastante grande y los isleños han acusado al fontanero del desaguisado: al pobre Mario le toca limpiar tan desagradables manchas de la isla y su honor. Mario cuenta con un nuevo aparato llamado ACUAC, una especie de cañón de agua que lanza chorros de este líquido a presión para acabar con las manchas y los extraños seres que de ellas emergen. Este aparato lo lleva Mario a sus espaldas, a modo de mochila, y cuando se acabe podrá rellenarlo sumergiéndose en el agua. El ACUAC puede usarse como planeador, con dos ch

Magna Cata Riedel en Club 51 – Gazzetta Hédoné ​Las burbujas de la icónica Moët Imperial nos daban la bienvenida al Club 51, ubicado en los pisos más altos de la Torre Mayor, y reservados para los eventos más exclusivos de la ciudad, como la Magna cata Riedel organizada por Marcas de Lujo Asociadas by American Express, el primer club privado de México que reúne y hace alianzas estratégicas entre marcas de lujo nacionales e internacionales. La elegancia y la privacidad de Club 51 fueron el ambiente ideal en el que se recibió a más de 150 de los empresarios más influyentes, reunidos para disfrutar de una exclusiva cata impartida por Maximiliam Riedel, quien es el CEO y líder de la 11va generación de la familia austriaca Riedel, que ha cambiado la forma de beber y de disfrutar del vino al diseñar copas específicamente para cada tipo de uva. Además de aprender de gran conocimiento vinícola, los asistentes fuimos parte de la presentación en toda América Latina de la nueva colección Riedel Performance. La línea Performance, además de hermosa, es la primera en presentar un cáliz con un impacto óptico luminoso, que añade un agradable aspecto visual al cáliz y también aumenta el área de superficie interior, permitiendo que el vino libere sus aromas y los muestre completos, incluyendo sus más sutiles matices. Los vinos elegidos para descubrir sus aromas cautivantes fueron Caymus, Emmolo y Belle Gloss de Wagner, The family of wine. Estos vinos crecen bajo el sol de California y son producidos con modernas técnicas, siguiendo estrictos controles de calidad, por lo que a nivel mundial son reconocidos como Premium, y han sido galardonados con 90+ pts. Robert Parker y The Wine Advocate. La combinación de Riedel con los vinos Wagner es irresistible, pues con estas copas se descubre sin interferencias el carácter del sabor de Napa Valley, que por su clima y la calidad de sus terruños, hace que sus vinos tenga un estilo muy particular y seductor. Con gran admiración, los asistentes pudimos comprobar la diferencia enorme y el impacto que genera beber vino en un vaso de plástico o en una copa de vidrio común, en contraste con el placer que se genera al hacerlo en una copa Riedel. Entre cada sorbo bebíamos un sorbo de agua mineral San Pellegrino, que al ser ligera y balanceada, es ideal para neutralizar los sabores que quedan en boca y contribuye a que el gusto no se sature. El agua San Pellegrino refresca al paladar y da una pausa entre cada prueba, preparándolo para disfrutar del siguiente trago o sin interferencias. La perfecta transparencia del cristal y su forma específica, hacen que sean las únicas copas del mundo en las que se descubren los aromas seductores de frutas oscuras maduras de Caymus, el paladar suave, en capas, con especias exóticas y de rica carnosidad de La Belle Glos Pinot Noir, y se aprecia sin i

Percepción de Luz y Temperatura de Color - Noticias - Fireflier Lighting Limited Percepción de la luz y temperatura del color Muchos factores afectan la calidad de la luz del LED. La temperatura del color, la reproducción del color y la calidad del color afectan tanto a cómo funciona la luz como a cómo se percibe. Aunque las propiedades tecnológicas de los LED y las fuentes de luz tradicionales no son directamente comparables, las demandas del usuario sobre cómo debe comportarse la luz de una buena luminaria permanecen inalteradas. La temperatura de color de una fuente de luz se da en Kelvin (K). Originalmente, Kelvin era una medida del color de un cuerpo negro caliente (y por lo tanto brillante). Para las lámparas con un filamento, esta medida es fácil de aplicar, ya que la temperatura de color en Kelvin es la misma que la temperatura real del filamento. Para fuentes de luz sin filamento - como tubos fluorescentes, lámparas de descarga de gas y LEDs - debemos calcular una temperatura de color correlacionada (CCT) en Kelvin. La temperatura de color puede variar de un fabricante a otro, incluso si reportan la misma medición. Además, la temperatura de color de un LED puede cambiar con el tiempo, lo que significa que el valor después de varios miles de horas de uso no será el mismo que para un nuevo producto. Cuando se producen LEDs, sus temperaturas de color y flujo luminoso varían ampliamente, por lo que es preferible elegir entre un surtido limitado. Los fabricantes clasifican sus productos en "contenedores" de acuerdo a su rendimiento. Cuanto menos cajones se seleccionen sus LED, más estable será la calidad del producto. Cuanto más cerca de la selección más disminuye la oferta y el costo aumenta, por lo tanto, los fabricantes de luminarias tienden a aceptar también los diodos de los contenedores cercanos. Esta ilustración muestra cómo calcular una temperatura de color correlacionada: La curva de relleno muestra la temperatura de color en grados Kelvin reales. La cromaticidad de la fuente de luz se mide en una de las líneas isotérmicas y la temperatura de color correlacionada es el punto donde la línea cruza la curva. La cromaticidad de un producto LED, es decir, el grado de desviación de su temperatura de color, se define en las elipses de MacAdam en Desviación estándar de coincidencia de colores (SDCM) según la norma CIE 1964. El sistema MacAdam proviene de los Estados Unidos y clasifica la calidad del color en una escala de 0 a 10. Entre 1 y 3 es difícil ver las diferencias de color, pero más arriba de la escala puede tener una clara y negativa disparities.The problemas son mayores cuando la iluminación de una superficie blanca, o colocar una tira de LED muy cerca de una pared blanca. Los requisitos para la mayoría de los otros entornos de interior son generalmente alrededor de MacAdam 3-5 SDCM. En comparación, un tubo fluorescente T5 de los principales fabricantes se trata de MacAdam 4. Para aplicaciones exteriores, una calificación de MacAdam 7 SDCM es perfectamente aceptable. Para ambientes con altas exigencias de igual calidad de color, como la iluminación de paredes blancas. Adecuado para la mayoría de aplicaciones en interiores. Principalmente para aplicaciones al aire libre. Una de las consideraciones clave es cómo la calidad del color de un producto cambia a lo largo de su vida útil. Algunos LEDs pueden mantener una calidad de color muy alta durante las primeras mil horas, pero luego se deterioran rápidamente. El diseño de la luminaria es otro factor crítico, donde el enfriamiento insuficiente, o el LED que se está ejecutando demasiado duro, pueden tener un impacto negativo. Cómo crear la luz blanca de un diodo azul, o en el caso a la derecha, de un racimo de diodos. En un LED individual, el fósforo cubre el diodo; En un módulo, el fósforo se coloca sobre una placa que cubre todos los diodos del módulo. Variaciones en luz blanca Los diodos blancos vienen en una amplia gama de temperaturas de color, de blanco caliente a muy frío (2700-8000 K). Por lo general, la luz blanca se crea mediante la aplicación de un revestimiento a base de fósforo a un diodo azul, ya sea directamente en el diodo o en una placa separada sobre él. Este recubrimiento convierte parte de la luz azul en luz blanca de varias temperaturas de color, un proceso que recuerda cómo funciona un tubo fluorescente estándar. La calidad de la luz se determina tanto por la especificación del LED azul como por el grado de adecuación del fósforo al diodo seleccionado. Debido a que un LED azul es la base de la luz blanca, la eficiencia es mayor para temperaturas de color más frías. Para obtener una temperatura de color más cálida, el fósforo debe convertir una mayor proporción de la luz azul original. Interpretación de color La representación del color en los LED no es exactamente la misma que en las fuentes de luz tradicionales, pero todavía se describe como Ra / CRI. La escala Ra es de 1 a 100 y mide la capacidad de la fuente de luz para producir colores. Dependiendo de su elección de LED, el grado de reproducción de color (Ra) varía normalmente de 60 a 95. Un Ra alto produce a menudo una luminancia algo más baja. Normalmente, la reproducción de color se mide utilizando el método CIE en una escala de ocho colores (ver ilustración). El índice de representación de color (CRI) se da como un valor medio (Ra), por lo que es posible que una fuente de luz sea buena en representar siete colores pero no tan buena en la octava. Una escala complementaria se llama CRI 1-14, que contiene seis colores más. Como muestra la ilustración, este LED no puede representar el color rojo brillante, número nueve, de una manera óptima

Publicado el 12/06/2018 08:00 am Según reportes de la Oficina de Estadística Agraria de la Dirección Regional Agraria (DRA), desde el 1 al 5 de junio, a raíz de la presencia inusual de nevada en la región Puno, se registró la afectación de 424 mil 660 cabezas de ganado de una población de 2 millones 033 mil 370 estimados en la región Puno. Según el jefe de la dirección de estadística de la DRA, German Cutipa Flores, manifestó que dichos registros se realizaron tras la evaluación en 48 distritos de los 109, de las 11 provincias del departamento de Puno, exceptuando a Moho y Yunguyo, que no tienen población de alpacas. En tanto, la muerte de alpacas asciende a 975; sin embargo, la presencia de nevadas continúa afectando a la población de alpacas, cuyos datos de mortandad y afectaciones se incrementarán, según el funcionario público. De continuar con la presencia de nevadas en Puno, Cutipa Flores vioó pertinente la declaratoria de emergencia, para brindar alimentación a los camélidos a través de los kits veterinarios y otros alimentos.

El tema de esta semana … aborto y embarazo adolescente . En entrevista con el DR. Guillermo A. Mier Garcia , ginecólogo y obstetra sub en cirugía de mínima invasión . UAQ Un vistazo …aborto y embarazo adolescente . -Roxana : En términos generales que es y hace un médico gineco- obstetra : -Guillermo: consiste en la vigilancia , prevención, atención y resolución de todos los procesos fisiológicos y patológicos en la salud femenina, así como la atención y vigilancia del embarazo . -Roxana : Tengo conocimiento de que laboras en institución pública y en el sector privado (bueno como casi todos los médicos, ya sabemos que estar en un solo hospital no alcanza la paga jajaja ) cuales son las diferencias entre ambas , hablando propiamente de tu especialidad . -Guillermo : En sector publico vemos a las pacientes con las patologías más complicadas ya sea por deficiencia de recursos económicos y un nivel cultural bajo , son pacientes muchas veces sin un diagnóstico de primer nivel de atención, si no ya en urgencias etc ,a nivel privado , la mayor cantidad de consultas son para vigilancia, y prevención de patologías ginecológicas y segundo lugar a control prenatal , llegan con mejor educación y acuden principalmente anticipativo a los cuidados y probables riesgos a la salud del binomio . -Roxana : hablemos del aborto …. Esta de moda no? Qué opinas , a favor o en contra y ¿porque? -G: estoy a favor y en pro de la salud de la mujer , y como especialista realizo el aborto solo si hay justificación, es decir si pone en riesgo la salud del producto o la madre , siempre basado en guías y normas vigentes .Mi vida profesional al igual que la privada esta regida por normas legales y éticas ,por lo que no realizaría un aborto sin justificación medica aun siendo este legalizado .Mi profesión es cuidar la vida. - R:el embarazo adolescente no es broma pero si parece moda , dime… en tu experiencia , ha aumentado la cifra .. cuales consideras son los puntos clave en este aumento y que propones para disminuir la cifra … G: la incidencia de embarazos no planeados a aumentado en mujeres menores de 19 años , en la última década a amentado 1 de cada 6, del cual más del 90 % son no planeados A nivel institucional es preocupante el número de embarazos no planeados, ya representa un problema de salud pública ,en sector public

EU y Arabia Saudita minimizan roce diplomático por Siria e Irán El secretario de Estado estadounidense, John Kerry, minimizó el lunes los roces con Arabia Saudita, al decir que las relaciones entre los dos países eran estratégicas y duraderas y que ambos coincidían en que las negociaciones eran la única forma acabar con la guerra civil en Siria. El ministro de Relaciones Exteriores de Arabia Saudita, el príncipe Saud al-Faisal, dijo por su parte que los desacuerdos recientes con Estados Unidos se referían fundamentalmente a tácticas y no a objetivos y que las diferencias eran una parte habitual del vínculo entre dos países. Las declaraciones se produjeron durante una conferencia de prensa conjunta en Riad, donde Kerry está de visita como parte de una gira regional que busca aliviar las tensiones con las potencias árabes, luego de un encuentro con el rey Abdullah. "Las relaciones (saudí-estadounidenses) siempre se han basado en la independencia y el respeto, y en servir intereses mutuos", dijo Saud. "La diferencia es una cuestión normal y buscamos solucionarla mediante la comunicación entre ambas naciones", agregó. En un comunicado leído durante la conferencia de prensa, el príncipe manifestó además en un pasaje sobre el conflicto sirio que su país reconocía la importancia de las conversaciones como una forma de poner fin al conflic

escrito por Jose Miguel Durán on Viernes, marzo 27th, 2009 | No hay comentarios ¿Sabés que pais ha producido durante el 2.007 mayor número de peliculas? Pues si estais pensando en EEUU, la potente industria cinematográfica India o si alguno sin saber donde disparar piensa en España, anda muy pero que muy equivocado. El pais con mas producciones cinematograficas del mundo se encuentra justo en el tercer mundo, en concreto en Nigeria que no solo ha sido capaz de producir más peliculas sino que ha conseguido convertirlo en un gran negocio que para algunos quisieramos. Bueno al grano, ¿cuantas peliculas ha sido capaz de producir este pais? Pues nada más y nada menos que mas de 1.500, frente a la India que ocupa el segundo lugar con 1.049 y EEUU con 590. El viejo continente fue capaz de producir 1.300 con un coste de 5.000 Millones, o sea 4 Millones de Euros por pelicula de media, mientras que los americanos tuvieron un coste medio de 20 Millones de Euros y la India 1 Millon, mientras que los nigerianos invirtieron una media de 15.000 Euros por pelicula. La verdadera sorpresa no está en la cantidad de peliculas producidad ni siquiera reparo en la calidad sino que han sido capaces de desarrollar un modelo de negocio cinematográfico que es posiblemente el mas rentable del mundo ya que se gastaron unos 22 Millones de Dolares frente a unos ingresos de 250 Millones de dolares. Este modelo de negocio es fruto de la necesidad que ha llevado consigo a saltarse el modelo tradicional basado en la producción y distribución , a un nuevo modelo low cost donde se ha pasado de exhib

Recomendaciones – Asociación de Senderismo Tomillo y Orégano de Llerena Para realizar una excursión con éxito, con las máximas garantías de seguridad, es imprescindible llevar un equipo adecuado y en buenas condiciones y preparar el itinerario previamente: – Equipamiento individual: El equipo personal del senderista debe incluir material o equipamiento básico, como por ejemplo una topoguía, calzado de trekking tipo bota o zapato, mochila, gorra o sombrero, crema solar, protector de labios, cantimplora, comida rica en azúcar e hidratos de carbono. Además, si el tiempo es inestable, o si se prevé llegar al anochecer o pasar la noche caminando, no deben olvidarse la linterna ni un paraguas pequeño, chubasquero o similar, y ropa de recambio. Tampoco está de más llevar un botiquín básico (con tiritas, desinfectante, aspirina, antiácido, gasa, aguja…). Lo normal, en un alto porcentaje de casos, es que no haga falta una vestimenta especial, si bien hay ropa y accesorios específicos que hacen más cómoda la actividad. Se recomienda ropa ligera, multicapa y térmica o transpirable, según la época. En caso de ser rutas por las altas sierras, pongamos a partir de 1.200 metros de altitud, hay que vestir ropa de media montaña añadiendo prendas cortavientos y chubasquero ligero. La parte de la indumentaria que se debe elegir con más detenimiento es el calzado. Aquí intervienen no solo los gustos personales sino también el tipo de terreno, la época del año o el tiempo previsto. Unas botas de media caña son las más versátiles En muchos casos, los senderos van por zonas bien comunicadas; en otros no. Normalmente en los pasos peligrosos, en los senderos señalizados se colocan advertencias explícitas, pero tato si el sendero o un paso peligroso, está o no señalizado, la MEJOR recomendación es la utilización del sentido común. – Normas básicas para el senderista: El secreto para hacer una buena caminata con un desgaste físico mínimo radica en dos factores: la capacidad física (que se logra con el entrenamiento) y la técnica (que se obtiene con el conocimiento del recorrido).

La presión de fluido es una característica de flujo importante que se requiere para determinar la aerodinámica de un sistema. Uno de los sistemas de medición de presión más antiguos y aún existentes es el manómetro debido a su precisión y simplicidad de funcionamiento. El manómetro es generalmente un tubo de vidrio en forma de U que está parcialmente lleno de líquido, como se muestra en la Figura 1. El manómetro de tubo En U no requiere calibración porque no tiene ninguna parte móvil, y sus medidas son funciones de gravedad y la densidad del líquidos. Por lo tanto, el manómetro es un sistema de medición simple y preciso. Figura 1. Esquema de un manómetro de tubo en U. Las mediciones de presión en tiempo real se obtienen en aeronaves conectando los puertos de estancamiento y presión estática de una sonda pitot-estática, un dispositivo que se utiliza comúnmente para medir la presión de flujo de fluido, a los puertos de un dispositivo de medición de presión. Esto permite a los pilotos obtener las condiciones de vuelo existentes y advertirles si se producen cambios en las condiciones de vuelo. Mientras que los manómetros proporcionan lecturas de presión muy precisas, son inherentemente voluminosos. Se necesita una solución más realista para medir las presiones de las aeronaves, ya que uno de los principales objetivos de diseño es mantener el peso total de la aeronave lo más bajo posible. Hoy en día, los transductores de presión electromecánicos, que convierten la presión aplicada en una señal eléctrica, se utilizan ampliamente para aplicaciones de detección de presión en aeronaves porque son pequeños, ligeros y se pueden colocar casi en cualquier lugar del fuselaje. Las características anteriores no solo ayudan a reducir el peso, sino que también reducen la cantidad de tubos necesarios para conectar la sonda pitotestática al transductor, lo que reduce el tiempo de respuesta de los datos. Además, en las pruebas de vuelo de aeronaves experimentales, los transductores de presión en miniatura son útiles, ya que permiten a los investigadores maximizar la recopilación de datos de presión sin aumentar significativamente el peso de la aeronave. Mientras que existen diferentes tipos de transductores de presión con diferentes técnicas de medición, uno de los tipos más comunes de transductor es el transductor de presión capacitivo. Como los transductores son capaces de enviar sólo señales en términos de voltaje y corriente, se requiere calibración del transductor para relacionar la fuerza de una señal en particular con la presión que hace que el transductor genere la señal. El ajuste de curva final que relaciona la corriente o voltaje del transductor con una medición física, en nuestro caso la presión, se conoce comúnmente como la curva de calibración del transductor. En este experimento, se coloca una sonda pitotestática en un túnel de viento subsónico con los puertos de estancamiento y presión estática conectados a los puertos totales y estáticos tanto del manómetro del tubo U como del transductor de presión. A continuación, el túnel de viento se ejecuta a diferentes ajustes de presión dinámica, y se registra la lectura de presión correspondiente del manómetro del tubo U y las lecturas de corriente producidas por el transductor. Estos datos se utilizan para generar curvas de calibración para el transductor de presión. JoVE Science Education Database. Ingeniería Aeronáutica. Transductor de presión: Calibración mediante un tubo estático Pitot. JoVE, Cambridge, MA, (2019). Para medir la presión dinámica, cada tramo del manómetro del tubo U está conectado a presiones desconocidas de los puertos de presión estática y total del tubo pitot-estático. La diferencia resultante se da por la siguiente ecuación: lo que se traduce en una diferencia en la altura de la columna en el manómetro del tubo En U. Esta diferencia en las presiones, o presión dinámica, se puede calcular utilizando la expresión: donde el agua es la densidad del agua (el fluido en el manómetro del tubo U), g es la aceleración debido a la gravedad, y elmanómetro h es la diferencia en las alturas de las columnas en el manómetro del tubo U. En algunos casos, el manómetro puede tener un desplazamiento debido a la cantidad insuficiente de líquido en la cámara y el desplazamiento en altura, hapagado, tendrá que tenerse en cuenta en la ecuación anterior como: El transductor de presión se basa en el principio de funcionamiento de un condensador, que consta de dos placas conductoras separadas por un aislante(Figura 2). Figura 2. Esquemas de un condensador (A) y un transductor de presión de capacitancia (B). La capacitancia se mide utilizando la ecuación: donde es la constante dieléctrica del material, A es el área de las placas, y d es el espaciado entre las placas. En un transductor de presión de capacitancia, una de las placas conductoras es reemplazada por un diafragma de conducción flexible, como se muestra en la Figura 2. Cuando se aplica presión, el diafragma se desvía, lo que provoca un cambio en d, lo que conduce a un cambio en la capacitancia. La electrónica del transductor está calibrada para generar cambios de voltaje específicos para los cambios correspondientes en la capacitancia, que a su vez se puede utilizar para medir la corriente para una presión aplicada determinada. 1. Calibración del transductor de presión En esta demostración, se utilizó un túnel de viento subsónico con una sección de prueba de 2,6 pies x 3,7 pies y un ajuste de presión dinámica máxima de 25 psf. Se utilizó un transductor de presión precalibrado para ajustar la presión dinámica en la sección de prueba del túnel de viento, y se utilizó un manómetro diferencial de tubo U con agua de color y escala para medir la altura del fluido(Figura 3). También se utilizó un transductor de presión diferencial(Figura 4),una fuente de tensión estándar (para alimentar el transductor) y un multímetro (para leer la corriente de salida del transductor), que se muestran en la Figura 5. Figura 3. Manómetro de tubo U de presión diferencial. Figura 4. Transductor de presión diferencial. Figura 5. Fuente de alimentación (izquierda) y multímetro (derecha). Monte un tubo estándar de pitot estático(Figura 6) desde la parte superior del túnel de viento utilizando un soporte de picadura vertical. Asegúrese de que la sonda está en el centro de la sección de prueba y está alineada en la dirección del flujo con el puerto primario orientado directamente al flujo. Figura 6. Tubo ppít-estático. Alinee la parte superior del fluido del manómetro con el marcador de doble anillo tórica en el tubo de vidrio. Si la lectura en la escala principal (en marrón, Figura 3) no corresponde a cero, elija un punto de referencia diferente, alinee el fluido del manómetro con la nueva referencia y registre el desplazamiento en altura (hoff). Conecte las salidas de estancamiento y presión estática del tubo pitot-estático a los puertos correspondientes del manómetro utubo y el transductor de presión mediante tubos de plástico flexibles y conectores de canal En. Tenga en cuenta que el transductor de presión se puede montar en cualquier superficie vertical plana siempre y cuando esté alineado de acuerdo con la Figura 4. Asegure las puertas del túnel de viento y encienda todos los sistemas. Tome la lectura para la condición de flujo sin aire (lectura cero). Inicie el túnel de viento y establezca la presión dinámica en la sección de prueba en 1psf. Aumente el ajuste de presión dinámica en el túnel de viento en pasos de 1psf hasta un ajuste máximo de 20psf y repita el paso 1.7 en cada ajuste de presión dinámica. Para comprobar si hay histéresis del transductor, disminuya la presión dinámica en pasos de 1psf hasta 0psf y repita el paso 1.7 en cada ajuste de presión dinámica. Al finalizar la prueba, apague todos los sistemas. Tabla 1. Datos recopilados para el experimento de calibración de presión Transductor P (psf) manómetro h (pulg) Itransductor Transductor WT Manómetro Multímetro En el análisis se utilizaron las siguientes constantes: densidad de agua, agua:61,04 lb/pie3; aceleración debido a la gravedad, g: 32,15 ft/s2; y manómetro apagado, hapagado a 0,8 pulgadas. La variación en los datos del manómetro para aumentar y disminuir las presiones dinámicas (con y sin corrección para el instrumento desactivado) se muestra en la Figura 7. La Figura 8 muestra una gráfica de las lecturas de corriente del transductor contra la presión del manómetro, que se calculó utilizando la Ecuación 3. Para obtener la curva de calibración para el transductor de presión, se ajustan dos curvas lineales a través de los puntos de datos crecientes y decrecientes, respectivamente. Las ecuaciones de ajuste lineal correspondientes son: Las ecuaciones para las curvas crecientes y decrecientes son casi similares, y las dos curvas se alinean entre sí, como se observa en la Figura 8. Por lo tanto, se puede deducir que el transductor de presión no tiene ninguna histéresis. Se puede utilizar una única ecuación de calibración que relaciona la corriente con la presión (Ecuaciones 5 o 6) para el transductor, eliminando así la necesidad de utilizar el voluminoso sistema de manómetro de tubo en U para todas las mediciones de presión futuras.

Los transductores electromecánicos son reemplazos populares para algunos de los sistemas de medición más voluminosos. Sin embargo, los transductores deben calibrarse regularmente utilizando dispositivos de medición estandarizados para ser herramientas experimentales eficaces. En este experimento, se calibraba un transductor de presión electromecánico de tipo capacitivo listo para usar comparando las señ

Elegimos del menú indio después de confirmar que el chef era en efecto de la India. Qué delicia, 6 de nosotros tuvimos varias entradas que eran recién preparado, sabroso y abundante. Los platos principales eran...igual de buenos, de nuevo con opciones diferentes, todos nos dijeron que era una de las mejores comidas indias que hemos tenido. El chef (que es nuevo) salieron a ver si estábamos disfrutando de nuestra comida, lo cual hicimos, totalmente! El servicio era agradable y rápido. Si te gusta la comida sabrosa cocina india recién hecho, dar la TJA Kavi intentarlo. Nuestros amigos estaban alojados en el hotel y decía que el desayuno también era bueno.Más Parada sobre el hotel. . Cómodas camas, duchas. bueno, y la comida era excelente. El personal era amable y servicial. Decepcionante servicio y la comida era promedio Tuvimos que esperar más de 40 minutos para que los alimentos lleguen a pesar de restaurante sólo había unos pocos clientes. La comida era apenas tibia y decepcionante. Intentamos explicarle a camarero, pero su pobre inglés significaba que no podía entender lo que estaba tratando...de decir que cuando quería la comida climatizadaMás debsj71 Visitamos solos durante su estancia en el Ramada. Era muy gratamente sorprendido por la calidad de los alimentos. Menú conservador ofreció sólo relativamente suficiente donde elegir y a precios razonables para un restaurante de hotel. Yo opté por bhaji de cebolla y pollo tikka masala..... . regados con un pinot rose blush. Sencillamente divina. Personal muy atento, en particular, el director que era encantador. Gran final de un largo día :-).Más Entorno lúgubre y hosco personal Es una pena, porque me pareció que la comida india muy sabroso. He probado el cordero Masala y el cordero Karahi. Ambos excelentes. Pero el servicio era bastante chungo, sin olvidar nuestro pedido dos veces, sin olvidar llevar el arroz, ni siquiera comprobar si todo...estaba bien.

Gordó advierte de que sin acuerdo con Rajoy no habrá consulta 15 de abril de 2013 (12:27 CET) Con más detalle o menos, con interpretaciones distintas, en el seno del Govern comienza a ofrecerse un mensaje claro, el de aceptar las dificultades de convocar una consulta soberanista en 2014. Si el President Artur Mas aseguró, hace una semana, que el referéndum podría demorarse hasta el final de la legislatura, este lunes ha sido el conseller de Justícia, Germà Gordó, quien ha reclamado una cierta calma en el proceso. Gordó, en el Fórum Nueva Economía, con la presencia del mundo judicial y de dirigentes del Govern, ha afirmado que no ve posible la consulta sin un acuerdo con el Gobierno central. "Sólo se podrá hacer si llegamos a un acuerdo con el Gobierno, y ahora lo veo difícil, aunque nosotros tenemos un compromiso en el Parlament para convocar la consulta". En un tono moderado, buscando el consenso, Gordó ha insistido en que el proceso necesita una cierta calma, y, en una alusión a Esquerra Republicana –en el acto estaba el diputado de ERC, responsable del área económica, Pere Aragonés-- se ha referido al acuerdo de gobernabilidad con los respublicanos. Según Gordó, el acuerdo mantiene que, preferiblemente, la consulta se deberá celebrar en 2014, pero, en función de las circunstancias que se presenten, se podría convocar a lo largo de la legislatura. "No tenemos que ir todos acelerados ni nerviosos", ha pedido el conseller de Justicia. Gordó ha considerado que buscar "un punto de encuentro" con el Gobierno es la única opción, porque da por seguro que, en caso contrario, el Ejecutivo español acudirá al Tribunal Constitucional para que anule la ley de consultas catalana que permita el referéndum. Caspe o Pau Claris En una conferencia, en la que ha repasado las actuaciones del departamento, ha insistido en la necesidad de dialogar con Madrid. Ahora bien, "desde Madrid también se deben estar dispuesto al diálogo". Ello le ha llevado a situarse en una disyuntiva, en el contexto histórico. Entre Caspe y Pau Claris, entre el pacto, y la soberanía que supuso una República catalana que duró sólo treinta días, Gordó se ha situado al lado de lo que supuso el Compromiso de Caspe. "La sociedad catalana muy mayoritariamente está por Caspe, por la negociación, el pacto y el consenso". La posición de Gordó coincide con la de Josep Antoni Duran Lleida, que este mismo lunes se ha pronunciado en contra de una posible declaración de independencia unilateral desde el Parlament. Una posibilidad que también rechaza Artur Mas

La rescisión del contrato con la consultora económica se oficializará en esta semana | MUNICIPALIDAD DE COMODORO La rescisión del contrato con la consultora económica se oficializará en esta semana La rescisión del contrato entre el municipio comodorense y la consultora CP&GP, se oficializará esta semana cuando el Ejecutivo envíe al Tribunal de Cuentas la documentación que respalde la determinación que necesariamente debe ser visada por el organismo contralor. La consultora había sido contratada el año pasado para mejorar el sistema de recaudación de los impuestos Tal como adelantó en forma exclusiva El Patagónico en su edición del sábado, el Ejecutivo municipal decidió rescindir el contrato que para el cobro de impuestos morosos cerró el año pasado con la consultora cordobesa CP&GP. El contrato fue suscripto el 13 de abril de 2016 a tres meses de la conformación de la consultora en Córdoba y fue presentado como una excelente oportunidad para mejorar la recaudación e implementar un moderno software y programa de modernización administrativa. La contratación fue avalada unánimemente por el Concejo el 26 de mayo de 2016, incluso por los ediles del radicalismo y de Chubut Somos Todos, como Norma Contreras que inicialmente habían objetado a la consultora por entender que el cobro de impuestos debía seguir siendo llevado adelante por los equipos municipales. En los equipos municipales la contratación también generó objeciones y la renuncia del entonces titular de Hacienda, Diego Touriñan, quien incluso a posteriori pidió públicamente que el intendente Carlos Linares vetara la ordenanza del Ejecutivo. Esa solicitud no fue analizada y, en consecuencia, ya con Germán Issa Pfister a cargo de Hacienda, el municipio siguió adelante con la contratación. La última observación a la contratación fue realizada en ese momento por los vocales del Tribunal de Cuentas, Gastón Acevedo (UCR) y Carlos Relly (Chubut Somos Todos), que consideraron que la misma era "onerosa" y que surgía de "una contratación directa". "El acuerdo de cooperación y asistencia técnica referida, no es más que una locación de servicios onerosa", se indicó. "EXCESIVAMENTE ONEROSA" Tal como informó El Patagónico, en la reciente resolución del Ejecutivo que da de baja la consultora y que ahora deberá ser girada al Tribunal, se reconoce que "la ejecución del contrato se ha tornado excesivamente oneroso para las partes", quienes –agrega- no pudieron "ponerse de acuerdo en la fijación de las bases de cálculo para establecer la retribución a resultado de la empresa del periodo fiscal 2017". La recisión comenzó a ser operativa a partir del 31 de marzo de este año cuando, en medio del temporal, desde el Ejecutivo se entendió que el municipio no estaba para contar con la asesoría de este tipo de consultoras, que por los servicios presta

Obispo de Sardes, +180 Fiesta: 1 de abril Etim: Melitón, griego: "Dulce como la miel" Alabanza de Cristo Obispo de Sardes (Lidia), en Asia Menor (Turquía). Considerado uno de los padres apologistas. Según Tertuliano, fue un profeta muy estimado por los fieles. Estableció el primer canon cristiano del Antiguo Testamento siguiendo el canon aceptado en ese tiempo por los judíos: contiene solo los libros protocanónicos y el Libro de Ester. Presentó paralelos elaborados entre el Antiguo Testamento y el Nuevo Testamento. Posiblemente Melitón creía en el reino milenario de Cristo en la Tierra. En una carta de Polícrates de Éfeso al Papa Víctor cerca del año 194, mencionada por Eusebio de Cesaria (H. E. 5.24) dice que "Melitón el eunuco" fue enterrado en Sardis. Del santo obispo de Sardes solo se conocían breves citas de sus escritos, que estaba lleno del Espíritu Santo y que era célibe. Pero en el año 1940 se descubrieron su Homilía sobre la Pascua y la Apología (c. 170) dirigida al emperador Marco Aurelio, concerniente a la relación entre Iglesia y Estado. Temas principales de sus escritos: cristología y soteriológica; Declara la divinidad y pre-existencia de Cristo como también su encarnación y el carácter sacrificial de su muerte; las consecuencias del pecado y el triunfo de Cristo Resucitado; El carácter de la Iglesia: conjunto de los que viven la vida nueva de Cristo; Las figuras del Antiguo Testamento, especialmente sobre el Cordero. Homilía pascual, 71-73; SC 123, pag. 101 "Herido por el endurecimiento de su corazón." (cf Mc 8,17) El es el cordero sin voz, el cordero degollado, nacido de María, la cordera graciosa. El ha sido sacado del rebaño y llevado a la muerte... Fue asesinado. ¿Dónde? En el corazón de Jerusalén. ¿Por qué? Porque había curado a los cojos, purificado a los leprosos, iluminado a los ciegos y resucitado a los muertos. (Lc 7,22) Por esto ha padecido. En la Ley y en los profetas leemos: "Me devuelven mal por bien. Me acusan cuando busco el bien. Han tramado maquinaciones contra mí: Destruyamos al justo, porque nos resulta odioso." (cf Sal 37,21 y Jr 11,19) ¿Por qué has cometido un crimen que no tiene nombre? Has deshonrado al que te honra, has humillado al que te había exaltado, has renegado del que te había reconocido, has rechazado al que te había llamado, has asesinado al que te había dado la vida... Era necesario que él sufriera, pero no por tu causa. Era necesario que fuera humillado, pero no por ti. Era necesario que fuera juzgado, pero no por ti. Era necesario que fuera crucificado, pero no por ti. ¿No has dirigido esta oración a Dios?: "Maestro, si hace falta que tu Hijo sufra, será por tu voluntad, no por la mía!" (Núms. 65-71: SC 123, 95-101): Muchas predicciones nos dejaron los profetas en torno al misterio de Pascua, que es Cristo; a él la gloria por los siglos de los siglos. El vino desde los cielos a la tierra a causa de los sufrimientos humanos; se revistió de la naturaleza humana en el vientre virginal y apareció como hombre; hizo suyas las pasiones y sufrimientos humanos con su cuerpo, sujeto al dolor, y destruyó las pasiones de la carne, de modo que quien por su espíritu no podía morir acabó con la muerte homicida. Se vio arrastrado como un cordero y degollado como una oveja, y así nos redimió de idolatrar al mundo, el que en otro tiempo libró a los israelitas de Egipto, y nos salva de la esclavitud diabólica, como en otro tiempo a Israel de la mano del Faraón; y marcó nuestras almas con su propio Espíritu, y los miembros de nuestro cuerpo con su sangre. Éste es el que cubrió a la muerte de confusión y dejó sumido al demonio en el llanto, como Moisés al Faraón. Este es el que derrotó a la iniquidad y a la injusticia, como Moisés castigó a Egipto con la esterilidad. Éste es el que nos sacó de la servidumbre a la libertad, de las tinieblas a la luz, de la muerte a la vida, de las tinieblas al recinto eterno, e hizo de nosotros un sacerdocio nuevo y un pueblo elegido y eterno. Él es la Pascua nuestra salvación. Éste es el que tuvo que sufrir mucho y en muchas ocasiones: el mismo que fue asesinado en Abel y atado de manos en Isaac, el mismo que peregrinó en Jacob y vendido en José, expuesto en Moisés y sacrificado en el madero, perseguido en David y deshonrado en los profetas. Éste es el que se encarnó en la Virgen, fue colgado madero y fue sepultado en tierra, y el que, resucitado de entre los muertos, subió al cielo. Éste es el cordero que enmudecía y que fue inmolado; el mismo que nació de María, la hermosa cordera; el mismo que fue arrebatado del rebaño, empujado a la muerte, inmolado al atardecer y sepultado por la noche; aquel que no fue quebrantado en el leño, ni se descompuso en tierra; el mismo que resucitó de entre los muertos e hizo que el hombre surgiera desde lo más hondo del sepulcro. I La novedad del Verbo hecho hombre. Porque, "como una oveja fue llevado al matadero" (Is 53, 7), Lo que era figura pasó, mas la realidad está presente. resucitó de entre los muertos como Dios, Voy a explicar detalladamente las palabras de la Escritura (cfr. Ex 12, 3-28): cómo Dios ordena a Moisés en Egipto, cuando quiere, de una parte someter al faraón bajo el látigo, y de otra librar a Israel del látigo por la mano de Moisés.

Inicio Comunidad de Madrid Parla Rafael Simancas amenaza a Pablo Sánchez La gestora del PSM, presidida por Rafael Simancas, ha pedido al actual candidato del PSOE a la alcaldía de Parla, Pablo Sánchez Pastor –apoyado por Tomás Gómez–, que «dé un paso atrás» en su candidatura, o de lo contrario será destituido. La amenaza, según Efe, llega después de que ayer se hiciera público que varios miembros de dicha gestora, nombrada tras la destitución de Tomás Gómez, están llamando a los diferentes líderes locales del PSOE para pedirles que en las asambleas que van a celebrarse –desde hoy hasta el viernes– muestren su apoyo a Ángel Gabilondo La gestora liderada por Simancas ha tomado directamente las riendas de la agrupación parleña. Esta, a su vez estaba siendo dirigida por otra gestora presidida por la ex diputada en la Asamblea de Madrid Rosa Alcalá, que cesó su actividad la semana pasada. Alcalá fue nombrada el pasado mes de octubre para hacerse cargo del control político del PSOE parleño tras la detención en la operación Púnica y posterior expulsión del partido del entonces alcalde de Parla y secretario general socialista en la ciudad, José María Fraile. La maniobra de apartar a Pablo Sánchez Pastor favorecería a la actual alcaldesa, Beatriz Arceredillo, qu

Sobre todo si le sumamos los caminos perdidos en las últimas dos décadas por errores graves en la calidad formativa. Tan es así que hay una tendencia que va cobrando cuerpo con fuerza que nos dice que deberemos desaprender parte de lo aprendido, para no basarnos tanto en materias memorizadas como en saber emplear la intuición, las decisiones propias según el momento y la ocasión, la iniciativa y el trabajar en equipo. Y saber buscar en cada momento los lugares de los que tenemos que beber y aprender nuevos conocimientos. Saber desde donde hay que leer, ver, tocar, escuchar, observar lo que poco a poco va viniendo como novedades y que casi siempre es lo mismo pero readaptado. Todos estudiamos para ser más eficaces en nuestra vida, para nosotros y para la sociedad. Es decir, para trabajar. El trabajo es el que nos hará felices si tenemos la suerte de poder elegir lo que nos gusta, y además, de proporcionarnos lo necesario para vivir, y servirá para ayudar a la sociedad sobre la que vivimos. Pero ahora ya intuimos posible que no haya trabajo para todos, o el menos no para 40 horas semanales. Y sabemos también que gran parte de lo aprendido ya no sirve, sobre todo si no hemos sido capaces de seguir aprendiendo constantemente. La actualización de contenidos debe ser tenaz a lo largo de nuestra vida real, no solo de nuestra vida laboral. Las nuevas personas laborales con responsabilidad en puestos de calidad media o alta, deben ser multidisciplinarias, capaces de tomar iniciativas y decisiones sobre muchos temas bien distintos, y sobre todo capaces de saber encontrar las soluciones. En el mundo digital casi todo está ya publicado. Quedan fuera l

También se realizó secuenciación de bisulfito del genoma completo y secuenciación del ARN. El equipo utilizó la secuenciación del genoma en el tejido tumoral e identificó una translocación de material genético entre los cromosomas 4 y 9, que estaba presente en todos los carcinomas directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago células acínicas examinados. Típicamente, tales translocaciones en tumores conducen a una nueva combinación de genes, que luego adquieren nuevas propiedades oncogénicas. En el caso de los carcinomas de células acinosas, la translocación que se ha descubierto hace que los elementos reguladores del ADN se transfieran de una Adelgazar 30 kilos cromosómica activa a un oncogén normalmente inactivo. Cuando los cromosomas se reorganizan, estos elementos reguladores altamente activos se ubican cerca del gen del Miembro 3 del Grupo A directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago la Subfamilia 4 del Receptor Nuclear NR4A3que generalmente se apaga una vez que se completa el desarrollo embrionario.

Aunque se atribuían muchos defectos a la riqueza y la propiedad privada, ordinariamente la conclusión no era la abolición de estas instituciones en un mundo imperfecto. Para la multitud de la gente ordinaria, la conclusión no era la institución de la propiedad comunitaria sino directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago necesidad de la caridad. En esto los Padres insisten en los términos mas enérgicos. La propiedad privada era tolerada pero no se le consideraba sacrosanta. Por derecho humano, sin embargo, alguien dice, esta tierra es mía, esta casa es mía, este es mi sirviente. Por derecho humano, esto es por derecho de los emperadores. La tolerancia de la propiedad privada tuvo su directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago también en el reconocimiento del valor de ciertas actividades económicas. No se consideraba sin embargo que todas las actividades económicas fueran censurables. El valor y la dignidad del trabajo humano fue enfatizado por varios de los Padres de la Iglesia. Llegó a pensarse - como llegó a ser prominente con los escritos de Adam Smith quince siglos después - que las actividades económicas perseguidas con fines de ganancia privada pueden tener como resultado un beneficio para la sociedad. La Edad Media. Con los invasores. Estas guerras eran costosas. Equipar solamente a un caballero requería un desembolso equivalente a la compra de veinte bueyes, o el equipo de labranza de diez labriegos. Bajo el feudalismo la propiedad de la tierra no era absoluta y divorciada de ciertos deberes como la había sido en Roma y como ha vuelto a ser en los tiempos directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago. La propiedad original de la tierra era del rey, el señor todopoderoso. Pero su derecho estaba directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago a la prestación de cierto tipo de servicios, militar, personal, de trabajo, o entrega de los productos. Pero la propiedad feudal no era solamente sujeta de derechos. Era también la base del poder político. Los señores feudales estaban investidos de numerosas funciones gubernamentales, disposición que nacía de la debilidad de las autoridades centrales en tiempos de pobres comunicaciones e inseguridad general. La Escolastica. Proviene del latín schola y era, esencialmente:. La Propiedad Privada no es contraria a la Ley Natural. Reglamentación de la Propiedad. La Mayordomía de la Riqueza. Con respecto a la adquisición y disposición Adelgazar 10 kilos justifica la propiedad privada sobre la base de las razones dadas por Aristóteles. directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago Parabéns pela conquista e ótimo vídeo. Este deber, que refleja la idea de la mayordomía de la riqueza, puede ser cumplido mediante actos de caridad, liberalidad, y magnificencia. En un pasaje de sus escritos discute el deber de compartir con otros las propiedades cuando la ley humana es suspendida bajo condiciones de urgente directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago, cuando la apropiación de los bienes deja de ser un robo. Te reto a dar like con el codo Los Escolasticos tardíos o Salmantinos. Se radicaron principalmente en Salamanca. Su objetivo era el de comprobar si el derecho de propiedad privada estaba de acuerdo con la ley natural y la ley divina. Aquellos que se oponían a la propiedad privada frecuentemente se amparaban en el pasaje del joven rico. Muchos interpretaban que con esta actitud nuestro Señor Jesucristo directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago la posesión de riquezas. Valorar una cosa creada por encima de su creador, tal directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago lo hizo el joven rico al preferir las riquezas al mandato divino, es ir en contra del orden natural. Muchas personas cercanas a Cristo eran ricas. NOVIEMBRE LME | Potasio | Hibridación in situ fluorescente San Francisco de Sales, explicó la actitud de pobreza, aun siendo ricos, de esta. Justamente por ser estos bienes escasos fue necesaria la propiedad privada, porque cuando los bienes son de todos no son de nadie, nadie se preocupa por su mantenimiento, pero todos quieren usufructuarlo. Desaparecería la virtud de la liberalidad, porque quien no posee nada propio no puede ser liberal. También desaparecía la directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago de la hospitalidad. Se percata del hecho de que la propiedad privada es el mejor medio para mitigar la escasez de los bienes económicos. Juan de Mariana reconoce la importancia que tiene el interés personal para el bienestar económico. Cuando los bienes se tienen en privado es mas difícil que existan fraudes. Luis de Molina, en su obra De iustitia directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago iure incluyó muchos argumentos en favor de Adelgazar 20 kilos propiedad privada. La escasez se agravaría y la gente se pelearía por el uso y consumo de los bienes. Los poderosos explotarían inevitablemente a los débiles. Francisco de Vitoria daba gran importancia a la propiedad privada, porque esta permitía el uso moral de los bienes. Las limosnas se deben realizar con los bienes propios y no con los comunes. Las virtudes de la caridad, liberalidad, hospitalidad y generosidad se dificultarían enormemente en un mundo sin propiedad privada. No siguió la saga u.u como fan de Zelda sigo esperando otro capítulo Este, puede ser definido como aquella parte del sistema. Señalaba que estos principios no son evidentes por sí mismos, provienen de razones utilitarias. Sin propiedad privada los bienes serían mal cuidados y la paz entre los hombres se tornaría imposible. La propiedad privada hace posible un orden social justo. El mal existe porque. La propiedad privada es conveniente para mantener el orden en la sociedad y. Justamente con el pecado original aparece el problema de la escasez, que es el origen de los problemas económicos. El Mercantilismo. Con la aparición de esta corriente económica, que ha de durar años, que pretende que el interés nacional va de la mano con el de la clase mercantil, el concepto de propiedad y riqueza toman un aspecto mundano y secular. John Locke. Locke toca también el problema de la desigualdad de la riqueza, aunque sin resolverlo satisfactoriamente, en sus Dos Ensayos sobre el Gobierno Civil, su gran contribución a la filosofía política. Locke desarrolla esta teoría sobre el fondo de un estado natural directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago no es necesariamente una situación histórica, sino la que hubiera podido existir en ausencia de un gobierno y una sociedad civil. Para Hobbes, el estado natural hubiera sido directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago guerra de todos contra todos, donde la fuerza y el engaño hubieran prevalecido. Para Locke, sin embargo, el estado natural no sería un estado sin ley, sino ordenado por la ley natural. El fin principal de que los hombres creen este medio de convivencia es para la mutua defensa de sus vidas, libertades y pertenencias, o sea todo aquello a lo que Locke da el nombre general de propiedad. Gracias por enseñarnos como estar saludables, (El jugo de vegetales verdes ya lo estoy tomando, (((((estoy tomando medicamentos para la presión alta, aún así puedo agregar el jengibre ?. Bonjour Guy ! Merci pour votre combat ! La ansiedad se puede volver un problema cuando los síntomas, duran mucho tiempo, se convierten en graves y desagradable, cuando ocurren con demasiada frecuencia. websiovideo-2391. Locke usa la palabra propiedad tanto en su sentido amplio, en el que abarca una extensa gama de intereses y aspiraciones humanas, como en un sentido estricto, cuando se refiere a los bienes materiales. Al considerar que la propiedad es un derecho natural que se encuentra por encima del gobierno, Locke difiere de Hobbes, para quien la propiedad es una creación del gobierno soberano. Al hacerlo proceder del trabajo, discrepa también de otros exponentes de la ley natural, que consideran que depende de un consentimiento general o de un contrato. La Teoría del Valor Trabajo. Del mismo modo que el cuerpo es propiedad directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago cada uno, así directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago también con el trabajo de su cuerpo, y con la labor de sus manos. Al aplicar el trabajo a los productos de la naturaleza, el hombre se apodera de ellos y los hace su propiedad. El directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago no es solo el origen de la propiedad, sino que marca también la diferencia del valor entre las cosas. Locke considera que el trabajo representa el noventa por ciento del valor de las cosas, atribuyendo el resto a la naturaleza. Los Límites a la Acumulación. En el estado natural, el trabajo que crea la propiedad, contiene también en sí mismo uno de los límites a la acumulación: la capacidad de producción del hombre. EL otro límite es la capacidad consumo del hombre. Ambas son consideradas por Locke como lo suficientemente moderadas como para impedir que las mercancías se estropeen o desperdicien, o que los hombres se roben unos a otros. A living autotune. Outstanding Mediante estas limitaciones a la acumulación de bienes perecederos y los factores que los producen, era posible evitar lo que Locke consideraba como una ofensa contra las leyes de la naturaleza: el desperdicio. La introducción del dinero marca la culminación de este proceso. La introducción del dinero hace posible la acumulación ilimitada de propiedad sin que se produzcan pérdidas por el desperdicio. El mismo consentimiento de la humanidad que da valor al oro y a. Directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago la introducción del dinero se desvanecen los límites que la ley natural había puesto originalmente a la acumulación y a la desigualdad. Locke no admite explícitamente que haya un conflicto entre la ley natural y lo que el hombre ha dispuesto por consentimiento general. La Fisiocracia. El individualismo de los fisiócratas se complementaba con un profundo respeto directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago la propiedad privada. Como Locke, Quesnay funda la propiedad privada en el trabajo, pero funda también el trabajo en la propiedad: es la seguridad de que se va a poseer una Adelgazar 50 kilos de cosas, dice, lo que induce al hombre a realizar el trabajo necesario para el bienestar de la sociedad. Los fisiócratas directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago de la propiedad de un hombre como la medida de la libertad de la que disfrutan. Para ellos la función primordial del orden positivo era la protección del derecho de propiedad. Quesnay resalta que la libertad y la igualdad son incompatibles. Carlos Marx. Como Locke, Marx considera que el directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago y la propiedad emanan del trabajo. Afirma que el trabajador es despojado del valor por el creado y por tanto de su propiedad por el capitalista. Doctrina Social de la Iglesia Católica. La abundancia de esta doctrina sobre el tema de la propiedad es considerable. Por ello trasladaremos aquí sólo algunos de sus principales conceptos. El que no quiera a Pablo se muere Quadragesimo Anno, m. Pío XII, en cuyo pontificado apareció con mayor agudeza la amenaza de la destrucción total del hombre por los sistemas de poder del comunismo, nazismo. En esta relación se debe contemplar La buena dieta doctrina acerca de la propiedad:. Otorga ser humano la base de seguridad material que es tan importante para el. XII, Radio mensaje del 1 de. Para Pío XII, el aprovechamiento de los bienes terrenales que no sea personal, va contra la dignidad humana, ya que a la persona pertenecen también libertad y autodeterminación, que se extienden al aprovechamiento de los bienes materiales. Solamente quien impugne al hombre la dignidad directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago la libre personalidad puede reconocer la posibilidad de substituir el derecho a la propiedad privada Pío XII, discurso del 20 de Mayo de También el Concilio Vaticano II se dirige a la relación mutua entre libertad económica y libertad cultural, política directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago espiritual. Gaudium et Spes, n. Así como la Igleasia ha rechazado el objetivo socialista de la directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago de la propiedad privada por incompatible con la dignidad humana y el orden social humanamente digno, así tampoco ha dejado en duda que una reglamentación de la propiedad sin vinculación social iría en contra del hombre y de su obligación social. A este respecto destacan directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago planteamientos:. Paulo VI, Populorum Progressio, 22 y Noventa años después de directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago Rerum Novarum Juan Pablo II afirma que toda la vida socioeconómica debe estar presidida por un principio: la prioridad del trabajo sobre el capital. En la Rerum Novarum se busca en la propiedad privada el fundamento de todo el orden Adelgazar 40 kilos, mientras que en la Laborem Exercens la propiedad, sea privada o colectiva, no es mas que un instrumento al servicio del trabajo. Cada uno de esos principios éticos no tiene consistencia total por sí mismo, sino en cuanto forma parte de un sistema. Pero tampoco la afirman. La Justicia. Interesa captar el significado que de hecho ha tenido en la historia de Occidente a fin de señalar a continuación la validez que tiene en la actualidad. El significado de la justicia debe ser analizado a partir de las coordenadas ideológicas en que aparece. Pensamiento Judeocristiano. Introduce en la noción de justicia los rasgos de: mesianismo, escatología, utopía. Directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago el judío cristiano la justicia es una promesa divina y una decisión humana, es un ideal absoluto y una concreción de la Bondad. La Filosofía Griega. En boca de Glauco y Adimante pone la opinión de que los hombres buscan siempre su propia ventaja, y encuentran ventajoso el cumplir las leyes, lo que constituye la justicia. A cada uno la función social que merezca por el conjunto de sus cualidades físicas, intelectuales y morales: tal sería para Platón la definición de la justicia social. La justicia mantiene el orden entre las tres clases de ciudadanos filósofos, militares, trabajadores. Esta deducción de la definición de justicia se apoya en consideraciones utilitaristas. Pero esto no quiere decir que sean el fundamento de la justicia. Se debe reconocer que las virtudes de los ciudadanos son las que determinan las de la Ciudad. Y en especial la Ciudad no puede ser justa si no lo son los propios individuos. Ahora bien, existe una misteriosa correspondencia entre la estructura del alma y la Ciudad. El alma, a su vez, se compone de tres partes, que son, la concupiscencia, la cólera, directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago la razón. Es justa cuando sabe dar a cada una el directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago que le corresponde. Justicia Aristotélica Aristóteles. El principio de moderación, ya discutido, es central en el pensamiento de Aristóteles. Directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago él subyace el concepto Aristotélico de virtud. Se distinguen varios tipos de justicia, incluida la justicia distributiva y la justicia correctiva. La justicia distributiva tiene que próstata cea wert con la distribución de la riqueza y los honores en la sociedad. No son distribuidos de manera igual sino en proporción a los méritos o valor individual de cada ciudadano. Mientras que la justicia distributiva establece una diferenciación de esta manera, la justicia correctiva iguala. Se relaciona con la corrección de males por el juez al reducir la ganancia de una parte y la pérdida de la otra.

Así rezaba una de las obras maestras de Arturo Pérez Reverte. Un aplicable a la EDMSB en su inicio de temporada en Primera Regional. En el fútbol, como en la vida, no hay nada imposible. Todo depende de la capacidad para soñar en lo que uno realmente quiere alcanzar. Un objetivo conduce a una meta, más o menos complicada dependiendo del grado de ambición de cada uno. Y este grupo humano ha venido demostrando en las dos últimas temporadas que de eso anda muy sobrado. La bisoñez, en estos casos, se compensa con un ingrediente que nunca ha faltado en este vestuario: la ilusión. El otoño llegó hace unos días con algo de retraso tras un verano sin mucha prisa por dejarnos. Con él una plaga de lesiones provocó un 'overbooking' en la enfermería del primer equipo de la Escuela Deportiva Municipal de San Blas, que anda firmando sus primeros pinitos en la Primera Regional madrileña. Chema, que por segunda temporada consecutiva será el comandandante del barco sanblasero, hace balance de las once primeras jornadas de competición: "Está siendo un inicio de temporada un tanto irregular, en el que hemos alternado grandes partidos con otros no tan buenos. Las lesiones, sin duda, no nos están ayudando demasiado. En este aspecto creo que debemos ser pacientes. Tenemos un equipo con jugadores de mucho talento que, tarde o temp

La Reforma Educativa "ya chupó faros", promete el Presidente a los maestros desde la Huasteca – Por Esto! La Reforma Educativa "ya chupó faros", promete el Presidente a los maestros desde la Huasteca El Presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador encabezó hoy en Ciudad Valles, San Luis Potosí, la entrega de apoyos del Programa Integral de Bienestar de su administración, desde ahí le aseguró al sector docente que se cancelará la Reforma Educativa del ex Presidente Enrique Peña Nieto. "Por el bien de todos, primero los pobres", repitió hoy el Presiente. Foto: Gobierno de México. Ciudad de México, 31 de marzo (SinEmbargo).– El Presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador prometió a los maestros, desde la Huasteca Potosina donde realiza una gira, que "la mal llamada Reforma Educativa ya chupó faros". El mandatario se dirigió a las y los docentes, les dijo "estamos cumpliendo", y continuó: "Está por cancelarse la Reforma Educativa, eso ya chupó faros". López Obrador acudió hoy al Centro Cultural de la Huasteca Potosina, en Ciudad Valles, San Luis Potosí, a donde acudió para entregar apoyos de los Programas Integrales de Bienestar. Desde ahí refrendó su compromiso con las promesas de campaña. El viernes pasado el líder del Ejecutivo y el Secretario de Educación, Esteban Moctezuma Barragán, expusieron esta mañana las diferencias entre la Reforma Educativa y la reforma que busca eliminarla. El mandatario federal aseguró que buscan informar con las bases del magisterio, pues los líderes tienen sus propios intereses y no siempre actúan con principios democráticos. Indicó que los dirigentes tienen sus propios intereses y no siempre actúan con principios democráticos, pero dijo que "ya no hay ciudadanos imaginarios, ahora cada ciudadano es una persona consciente, con criterio". El Jefe del Ejecutivo Federal ofreció de nueva cuenta a los maestros dialogo y reiteró que no habrá "nada de represión". López Obrador defendió esta mañana desde San Luis Potosí los cambios que plantea su Gobierno: "No llegamos a la presidencia después de haber luchado tanto tiempo para hacer lo mismo, no les vamos a fallar", se comprometió. El Presidente anunció que envió hoy un mensaje a Esteban Moctezuma para pedirle su apoyo con un programa de bandas de guerra en las escuelas. "Tenemos que saber todos cómo está el presupuesto, antes no se sabía, pero hoy queremos que se sepa qué le corresponde al pueblo. Decirle que vamos a llevar acciones importantes para el bienestar, porque eso es lo más importante, que ellos tengan para lo indispensable. Hay que atender a todos, pero hay que darle prioridad a los humildes", expuso. Por eso, dijo que se dará apoyo como nunca a las personas. "Ahora tenemos la fórmula: acabar con al corrupción y la impunidad". Aseguró que antes solo se repartía riqueza a los pobres en época electoral, lo que su administración terminará. "Por eso vengo a decirles que no le vamos a quedar a deber nada al pueblo de México", dijo. "Son muchos los pendiente y retomando una frase de Madero, el pueblo de México está sediento de justicia" Festejó que el apoyo a adultos mayores sea de más de 2 mil 550 pesos, las personas indígenas lo reciben desde que tienen 65 años y en otros lugares del país desde los 68. Recordó que se realiza un censo para identificar a las y los adultos mayores y a las personas con discapacidad, así como con las personas jóvenes. "No pasar el dinero por el gobierno, ese fue un consejo que me dieron mis asesores, los adultos mayores, a los que escucho siempre, me dijeron, no entregues el dinero a través del Gobierno, por eso desde la tesorería bajará el dinero a quien lo necesite. Dijo que solo en Ciudad Valles hay 6 mil 021 estudiantes de nivel medio superior recibirán una beca de mil 600 pesos cada dos meses y serán 869 becas para estudiantes de universidades. Defendió la creación del programa jóvenes construyendo el futuro, donde se les pasará a los jóvenes mientras se les capacita como aprendices. Dijo que no hay limites para solicitantes porque se tienen contemplados 44 mil millones de pesos para dicho programa. Dijo que la pobreza se desató porque se abandonó al campo y los jóvenes, que la violencia no se enfrentará con más violencia. Aseguró que las cosas cambiarán con bienestar para el pueblo, garantizando que todas y todos tengan oportunidades de trabajo, lo que ayudará a resolver el problema de la inseguridad; y "pintar claramente la ralla aquí la delincuencia y aquí la autoridad, nada de que se algo mismo la delincuencia y la autoridad". Opinó que la huasteca es un ejemplo de la deficiencia de la política neoliberal, destacó la riquez

La automotriz Volkswagen anunció hoy el despido de 30 mil trabajadores en todo el mundo, de los cuales 7 mil serán en Argentina y Brasil, lo que agravará aún más la crítica situación que enfrenta el sector en el país por la recesión. En la Argentina, Volkswagen cuenta con 6.000 trabajadores en las dos plantas industriales en General Pacheco (Buenos Aires) y en Córdoba. Al igual que las demás terminales locales, la compañía alemana tuvo que adelantar vacaciones y suspender personal para enfrentar el estancamiento que tiene la industria y principalmente el rubro automotriz. "Si no protegemos la industria vamos a perder puestos de trabajo. Ahora no perdimos, pero hay licenciamiento. No sé después de fin de año, si esto no se revierte, hasta cuándo vamos a sostener el licenciamiento", indicó el gre

Reiki en Esclerosis Múltiple. – Asociación de Esclerosis Múltiple Madrid «Reiki» es una palabra japonesa que significa energía vital universal. En la actualidad, se utiliza para describir el sistema de sanación descubierto por Mikao Usui. «Rei» significa universal y se refiere a la energía presente en todas las cosas y lugares. «Ki» es la energía vital individual que rodea nuestros cuerpos y nos mantiene vivos. Está presente fluyendo en todos los organismos vivos. Fuente de la imagen: https://pixabay.com/static/uploads/photo/2014/03/11/22/57/wellness-285590_960_720.jpg El Reiki sería el proceso de encuentro entre estas dos energías. Es una energía semejante a las ondas de radio y puede ser aplicada tanto localmente como a distancia. Cuando hacemos uso de energía Reiki estamos aplicando energía luz para tratar de recuperar la salud física, mental, emocional y espiritual. Buscamos armonizar la totalidad del ser. Todos nosotros podemos ser canales de Reiki, no existe límite ni condiciones. No es un sistema religioso, de hecho, se utiliza por practicantes de diversas confesiones, y no desgasta al que lo practica ya que éste no aporta su propia energía sino que canaliza la del universo a través de sus manos. Está reconocido por la Organización Mundial de la Salud. Y para sorpresa de todos, está basado en postulados de la física cuántica, que propone que todo lo que existe es energía. Según los postulados de la física cuántica, ya que toda la materia del universo se encontraba junta antes del big bang, toda la materia del universo continúa relacionada después del big bang. Se ha demostrado en estudios de fotones separados de forma artificial, que en un inicio estuvieron juntos, que si se cambia el spin de un fotón, el spin de otro fotón cambia también aunque se encuentre separado de su compañero. Por tanto, según la física cuántica, la energía universal sería común a todo. Y esa energía, común a todo, podría canalizarse a través de las manos, en presencia, y también a distancia. Para explicarlo, recordemos un estudio controlado doble ciego de Masaru Emoto publicado en la revista Explore (NY), demostraba que se podían focalizar emociones positivas (energía) a distancia (de Tokio a California), y que estas emociones positivas podían modificar la estructura de moléculas de agua aisladas de radiaciones electromagnéticas en unas celdas de California.[1] Por tanto, la energía podía enviarse también a distancia, con un propósito sanador. Que no es más que lo que muchas veces hacemos desde la religión, sea cual sea aquella en la que creamos, y que puede beneficiar a la salud y modificar procesos fisiológicos cardiovasculares, neuroendocrinos e inmunitarios[2]. Cualquier persona puede ser canal de Reiki. El Reiki es una energía de amor que pasa a través de nuestro corazón y fluye a través de nuestras manos. Cuando nos convertimos en canal de Reiki, somos tan solo un medio a través del cual fluye la energía del amor universal. A partir del momento de la iniciación por un maestro Reiki, cada uno de nosotros podemos comenzar a canalizar esa energía a través de las manos: para nosotros mismos (autotratamiento), para otras personas, animales, plantas… o a distancia (cuando el receptor no se halla presente). Esa energía se envía "para lo que necesite el ser interior del receptor" ya que, al tratarse de una energía inteligente, sabe mejor que nosotros como debe actuar. Pero los efectos son siempre positivos. Produce un gran estado de relajación y tranquilidad; sensación de serenidad; mejora el sueño y a través del control del estrés, una armonización del sistema inmune. Sin apenas efectos secundarios, aunque está contraindicado en personas que sufran crisis epilépticas (podría desencadenarla), en fracturas que no hayan sido reducidas (pueden empezar a consolidar antes de tiempo), en el momento justo de una intervención quirúrgica (puede provocar que el paciente despierte) y en pacientes con marcapasos. Fuera de ello, no existen muchas más contraindicaciones. Sólo efectos positivos. En las enfermedades autoinmunes se ha observado también una gran mejoría en los síntomas de ansiedad y depresión. Existen algunos trabajos publicados sobre Reiki, pero existe mucha más experiencia de su uso clínico, sobre todo en pacientes oncológicos. En EEUU, para desvincularlo de connotaciones espirituales, en algunas ocasiones se denomina "therapeutic touch" (toque terapéutico). En Madrid se utiliza en Hospitales como el Ramón y Cajal y La Paz en servicios de oncología, en EEUU se utiliza en la prestigiosa Clínica Mayo también en programas de oncología integrativa. Hay algunos estudios que parecen indicar que sus efectos beneficiosos puedan estar relacionados con incremento de la banda de actividad theta en el cerebro, y con la sincronización de ambos hemisferios cerebrales[3]. Las ondas theta, con una frecuencia de entre 4 y 7 por segundo, se manifiestan principalmente durante el sueño (con ensueño). Aparecen también en los estados de meditación profunda, intensa creatividad, en los fenómenos de percepción extrasensorial y bajo los efectos de la anestesia. La sincronización de los hemisferios cerebrales es una herramienta utilizada en la neuropsicología aplicada, que restablece el sosiego y la serenidad ante distintas circunstancias de la vida. Esto podría explicar la intensa calma y paz que experimentan los receptores de Reiki, con disminución del cortisol y mejora de la función inmune. Aplicado a pacientes oncológicos en tratamiento con quimioterapia se ha observado mejorías en la calidad de vida y el estado de ánimo[4], excluyéndose que se debiera al efecto placebo[5]. Habrá quien todavía pudiera insistir en que estos efectos son debidos al efecto placebo. Un estudio muy interesante realizado en 2014[6] realiza una comparación de los efectos de tres técnicas sobre el dolor lumbar: manipulación espinal quiropráctica, movilización espinal y toque terapéutico (Reiki). Lo más llamativo no es solo que se produjese la misma mejoría con los tres procedimientos, sin diferencias entre los tres grupos, sino que al estudiar las zonas cerebrales mediante resonancia magnética funcional, se produjeron cambios en las mismas regiones cerebrales para los tres grupos de estudio. ¿El efecto placebo modificaría una resonancia magnética cerebral? Parece entonces que el Reiki aplicado a personas con enfermedades autoinmunes (Esclerosis Múltiple) podría inducir estados de relajación, disminución del estrés y mejora en los patrones del sueño, lo que conduciría a una mayor r

Científicos descubren que el coronavirus se transmitió a 8 metros de distancia en una planta procesadora de carne - La verdad oculta Inicio » sociedad » Científicos descubren que el coronavirus se transmitió a 8 metros de distancia en una planta procesadora de carne julio 26, 2020 La verdad oculta Imagen ilustrativaJorge Adorno / Reuters El estudio de un brote en la instalación reveló que las condiciones ideales para la transmisión del virus por aire a grandes distancias son: bajas temperaturas, ausencia de aire fresco y una fuerte ventilación. Científicos alemanes concluyeron que el coronavirus puede transmitirse a una distancia de más de 8 metros, según un comunicado del Instituto Helmholtz de Enfermedades Infecciosas de Alemania (HZI). Esta capacidad del virus letal se descubrió durante el brote de coronavirus en la planta procesadora de carne Tönnies en Renania del Norte-Westfalia, ocurrido en mayo y que se saldó con unas 1.500 personas infectadas. Un estudio conjunto del Instituto Helmholtz, el Centro Médico Universitario de Hamburgo-Eppendorf (UKE), el Instituto Heinrich-Pette y el Instituto Leibniz de Virología Experimental (HPI), reconstruyó los eventos de transmisión iniciales en mayo de 2020 y sus resultados fueron publicados en la plataforma SSRN. Se descubrió que el brote fue originado en un solo empleado, y de él se transmitió a varios trabajadores en un radio de más de ocho metros. La transmisión principal tuvo lugar en la sala de deshuese, con fuerte circulación de aire y una temperatura permanente de 10 ºC. "Nuestros resultados indican que las condiciones dentro de la sala de deshuese de la planta de procesamiento de carne –estos son la baja temperatura, el bajo suministro de aire fresco y la circulación constant

Este chico es un demonio: despiden a Gilbert Gottfried por hacer bromas sobre Japón en Twitter - Cooking Ideas Este chico es un demonio: despiden a Gilbert Gottfried por hacer bromas sobre Japón en Twitter «Japón es realmente avanzado. Ellos no van a la playa. La playa va a ellos». El actor Gilbert Gottfried Gilbert Gottfried no es Nacho Vigalondo; es más alto y se dedica desde hace mucho más al mundillo del vodevil. Y, de vez en cuando, también a soltar perlitas geoestratégicas en Twitter. Este eterno actor secundario norteamericano (que siempre recordaré por hacer de malo en la primer de "Este chico es un demonio") ha visto como de repente su cara aparece en todos los trendings del odio mundial, al ser despedido fulminantemente de Aflac Inc., la compañía que le tenía contratado desde principios de siglo para dotar de voz al «pato Aflac". El pato Aflac es un ganso que, al igual que el erizo de Génesis, se encarga dar la barrila en los spots a los posibles clientes de esta aseguradora norteamericana. Lástima que también de la casualidad que esta aseguradora tenga el 75% de su negocio en Japón y que se esté preparando para una avalancha de reclamaciones, que a buen seguro va a dejar al patito tiritando y sin plumas. Michael Zuna, director de la aseguradora declaró, después de mandarle el finiquito en un sobre pequeño, que los recientes comentarios de Gilbert sobre la crisis en Japón carecían de humor y, ciertamente, no representaban los pensamientos y los sentimientos de cualquier persona que trabaja Aflac

Elyas Machera | La Rueda del Tiempo Wiki | FANDOM powered by Wikia Hombres, Nacionalidad desconocida, Guardianes Primera aparición EODM 23 Última aparición URDL 40 Nombre completo Elyas Machera Alias Diente Largo Nacimiento ca. 943 NE Rango Hermano Lobo Afiliación Lobos Complexión Enjuto Pelo Castaño salpicado de canas Ojos Amarillos-dorados Rina Hafden (Aes Sedai) "Tarde o temprano siempre hay problemas cuando hay dos humanos cerca." Elyas Machera es un hombre maduro que ha decidido cortar todos los lazos con su vida anterior tras descubrir que es un Hermano Lobo y que puede comunicarse con los lobos. Ha evitado durante largo tiempo al resto de humanos y ha vivido los últimos años en compañía de estos animales en territorios salvajes, lo que ha incrementado aún más sus habilidades de supervivencia. En el lenguaje de sensaciones, olores e imágenes de los lobos, Elyas es llamado Diente Largo, por el cuchillo con el que siempre va armado. Es probable que Elyas supere los cincuenta años de edad, ya que en Nueva Primavera es un hombre joven, de complexión musculosa, hombros anchos y barba corta. Después de haber vivido al raso los últimos quince años y en compañía de los lobos, su aspecto ha desmejorado notablemente, su cuerpo es ahora más flaco y enjuto que en sus días de juventud y se ha vuelto más desastrado. Actualmente su pelo sigue siendo castaño aunque con varias canas, y lo lleva largo hasta la cintura y recogido en una coleta. También se ha dejado la barba larga, hirsuta e igualmente canosa. Viste enteramente con pieles, con un característico gorro de formas redondeadas y siempre lleva consigo un cuchillo, arco y flechas. Mas el rasgo distintivo por excelencia de Elyas Machera son sus ojos, de un sorprendente color amarillo-dorado que desconciertan y atemorizan a todo aquél que lo contempla por primera vez, hasta el punto de que algunos llegan a creer que se trata de un taimado Engendro de la Sombra. Elyas en su juventud Ya en la Guerra de Aiel Elyas Machera era uno de los Guardianes de la Aes Sedai del Ajah Verde Rina Hafden, junto a Waylin. Ambos hombres entrenaban juntos y eran considerados prometedores Gaidin, muy adecuados para una Aes Sedai joven como Rina. Las habilidades de Elyas en la espada eran tan buenas que llegó a entrenar a un joven Lan Mandragoran, después de que éste fuera vinculado por Moraine Damodred. Sin embargo, la vida de Elyas como Guardián de Rina tocó a su fin en torno al año 983 NE, cuando empezó a manifestar extrañas habilidades de las que no se tenía constancia en la Torre Blanca. Elyas comprendió más tarde que era un Hermano Lobo, que podía vivir, sentir y entenderse con los lobos y que debía aprender a aceptar esta dualidad entre humano y bestia. Cuando resultó patente por el color de sus ojos el cambio que se había operado en Elyas, el Ajah Rojo lo acusó injustamente de poder encauzar el Poder Único y trató de detenerlo, encerrarlo y amansarlo. Éste, en legítima defensa, mató a varios Guardianes y escapó de la Torre para nunca más regresar. La muerte de los otros Gaidin es un triste suceso que Elyas aún recuerda con pesar, mas no se arrepiente de lo hecho y no quiere volver a tener nada que ver con las Aes Sedai. Tras este suceso, se sabe que vivió un tiempo en Saldaea con una mujer llamada Merya y más tarde se retiró a las tierras agrestes a vivir acompañado por su propia manada de lobos. Durante todo este tiempo ha seguido existiendo el vínculo entre Elyas y Rina, mas ésta lo ha enmascarado y, que se sepa, no ha vuelto a establecer contacto con su Guardián. Elyas se traslada por las zonas escasamente pobladas del norte de Andor junto a una manada de lobos en la que se encuentran su líder, Moteado, y otros miembros como Quemado, Saltador y Viento cuando se topan con la pista de dos chicos jóvenes a todas luces perdidos. Al cabo de dos días de vigilancia, Elyas opta por mostrarse ante Perrin Aybara y Egwene al'Vere y les ofrece compartir su cena junto al fuego. Los dos muchachos aceptan agradecidos el buen trato de Elyas, aunque el desconcierto que sienten al ver a los lobos y conocer la historia de aquel extraño hombre es más que evidente. Elyas se muestra amistoso con ellos y no sólo les cuenta a rasgos generales sus andanzas sino que no se molesta cuando queda claro que la historia de Perrin y Egwene no es del todo cierta, y así se lo comunican los lobos. Los dos chicos han de llegar cuanto antes a Caemlyn, donde esperan reunirse con los amigos de los que se separaron accidentalmente unos días atrás, así que Elyas decide ayudarles y guiarles de vuelta a los caminos principales. Perrin y Egwene junto a Elyas y los lobos El Hermano Lobo explica a Perrin y Egwene que la capacidad de comunicarse con los lobos es muy antigua, aún más que las Aes Sedai, una habilidad que proviene de la noche de los tiempos que parece estar resurgiendo. Ante la estupefacción de los dos jóvenes, Elyas revela que los lobos han identificado a Perrin como una persona que también puede llegar a convertirse en Hermano Lobo. El muchacho de Campo de Emond se niega a creer al nómada, pero al cabo de unos días, y muy a su pesar, sus ojos empiezan a adquirir el tinte dorado y experimenta una metamorfosis interior que, con el tiempo, le permitirá comunicarse con los lobos y viajar por el Sueño del Lobo de la misma forma que lo puede hacer Elyas. Pese a ello, Elyas intenta ayudar en todo lo que pueda a Perrin y también mantiene una charla con él en la que le dice que no debe renunciar a su hacha hasta que haya dejado de odiarla y utilizarla sólo cuando no tiene otro remedio. Los viajeros se topan con una caravana de gitanos dirigida por Raen, un viejo conocido de Elyas. Éste accede a pasar un tiempo con ellos mientras los lobos se mantienen lo suficientemente alejados, aunque resulta obvio que las formas de vidas de él y de los plácidos Tuatha'an difícilmente podría ser más diferentes. La experiencia se interrumpe de forma súbita cuando Perrin vuelve a ser acosado en sueños por Ba'alzamon, pese al intento de los lobos de ocultarle. Sabiéndose perseguidos por un enemigo que los supera con creces, el grupo se despide de los gitanos y huye a toda velocidad por el campo mientras un enorme bandada de cuervos los acosa hasta que se refugian en un stedding abandonado. Allí apenas tienen descanso, pues al poco son descubiertos por un contingente de los Hijos de la Luz, y Perrin les ataca después de que uno de ellos mate a Saltador cuando el lobo trata de defenderles. Perrin y Egwene son hechos prisioneros, acusados de Amigos Siniestros y Elyas desaparece sin dejar ni rastro. Poco antes de ser liberados por Moraine y Lan, Perrin se comunica con Moteado y se entera de que Diente Largo se encuentra bien y recuperándose de las heridas sufridas. Elyas y Saltador (por Ariel Burguess) Cerca de dos años después de conocerse, Perrin y Elyas se reencuentran en circunstancias bien diferentes. En todo este tiempo, Perrin ha comenzado a asumir su naturaleza y sus nuevas capacidades, aunque aún le invade el miedo de perder su humanidad. Por si esto no fuera poco, se ha convertido en un auténtico líder político y militar, por más que le desagrade esto, y se ha trasladado a Ghealdan para restablecer el orden, a petición del Dragón Renacido. Elyas deja a los lobos y acude hasta Perrin, pues presiente que su joven amigo va a necesitar su ayuda y que la Última Batalla (o Última Cacería, como la llaman los lobos) está a punto de llegar. Perrin recibe con alegría a Elyas y no tarda en incluirlo en su círculo de más estrechos colaboradores. Así mismo, le habla de su esposa, Faile Bashere, y de las constantes discusiones que mantienen debido a la actitud celosa de ella. Elyas revela entonces que él vivió hace años con una saldaenina y está muy al tanto del belicoso carácter de estas mujeres, por lo que le da una serie de consejos que logran, inesperadamente, afianzar la relación entre Perrin y Faile. Elyas forma parte de la comitiva que acompaña a Perrin a su encuentro con el Profeta, Masema Dagar. A su regreso de Abila, el grupo recine una devastadora noticia: Faile y otras mujeres han sido capturadas y seguramente convertidas en gai'shain por los Shaido que vagan por la zona. Inmediatamente, Elyas se dirige hacia el sureste para explorar y dar con la pista a los secuestradores, acompañado por Aram, el nieto de Raen reconvertido en guardaespaldas de Perrin. Unos días después, Elyas y Jondyn Barran encuentran el rastro de un gran ejército que se dirige hacia el sur y, a través de las Far Dareis Mai y los Guardianes de las Aes Sedai que acompañan a Perrin, le hacen llegar la noticia mientras continúan la persecución. Finalmente, Elyas y Jondyn regresan ante Perrin con la noticia de que ya han encontrado la pista de los Shaido y han determinado, más o menos, hacia qué dirección se dirigen. Un devastado y obsesionado Perrin les recibe y les agradece sus esfuerzos, antes de mandarles de vuelta a las líneas de exploración para que descubran más cosas. Cuando Elyas regresa, Perrin ha descubierto huellas de una gran manada de Sabuesos del Oscuro que pasó muy cerca de su campamento y, ante una noticia tan preocupante, Elyas le recuerda que los lobos se sumarán a la Última Cacería y se enfrentarán con aquellos Engendros de la Sombra. Diente Largo informa además que los Shaido se han establecido en un lugar fijo, en Malden, y que están llegando al campamento varios septiares cuyos efectivos superan con creces las fuerzas de Perrin. Aram no se deja intimidar por ello y replica que deben atacar a los Shaido, mas Elyas le contesta con dureza que deben ser cautelosos. Perrin observa que Elyas y Aram no se llevan nada bien y que el joven gitano cada vez es más violento e irascible, sobre todo desde que comenzó a frecuentar la compañía de Masema. Elyas (por Solitarium) La tensión acumulada por no tener noticias de su mujer lleva a Perrin a extremos que nunca pensó que alcanzaría cuando corta la mano con su hacha a un Shaido capturado en medio del interrogatorio. Asqueado por ver en lo que se ha convertido, Perrin se marcha solo al bosque, pero Elyas habla con él. Perrin reconoce a su amigo que había empezado a disfrutar usando el hacha, aunque por sus palabras Elyas le responde que sólo se dejaba llevar por el fragor de la batalla. Pese a ello, cuando los dos vuelven a su campamento, Perrin deja tirada en medio del bosque su hacha, decidido a no esgrimirla nunca más. De cara al inminente ataque que van a lanzar las fuerzas de Perrin y los seanchan sobre los Shaido atrincherados en Malden, el joven Ojos Dorados envía a un destacamento a través del acueducto para que se infiltren entre las ruinas de la ciudad. Entre ellos se encuentra Elyas, quien en la posterior batalla sigue a Gaul, ansioso por ser el primero en encontrar entre las prisioneras a Chiad, la mujer con la que desea casarse. A lo largo de todo el camino de Malden hacia Jehannah Elyas continúa ejerciendo de explorador del ejército cada vez mayor que acompaña a Perrin, si bien por su especial posición como persona de confianza suya, es uno de los que es enviado a través de los accesos también a analizar la situación que se vive actualmente en Cairhien. A su regreso, Elyas mantiene una vigilancia constante sobre el campamento de los Hijos de la Luz enfrentado al de Perrin de cara a un posible enfrentamiento. Durante estos días Perrin pasa por muchas tribulaciones en el Sueño del Lobo que terminan fortaleciendo su carácter y determinando que por fin acepte su papel de líder, mas antes de ello mantiene una conversación privada con Elyas en la que le habla de su temor de perderse entre los lobos y acabar como Noam, un hombre a quien conoció que se comportaba como una bestia salvaje. Elyas le responde que sus temores son lógicos, pero que mientras se mantenga fuerte podrá decidir qué camino tomar, de la misma forma que hizo él en su día. Precisamente al hilo de estos pensamientos, Elyas se separa de Perrin al llegar a Puente Blanco, diciéndole que ya es hora de que siga su propia ruta hacia el norte, donde se están congregando los lobos. Los dos Hermanos Lobo se separan prometiéndose reencontrarse en la Última Cacería. Si bien es cierto que Perrin comienza la Última Batalla combatiendo con sus fuerce en el frente de Andor, no tarda mucho tiempo en trasladarse al Sueño del Lobo, consciente de que en él los seguidores de la Sombra campan a sus anchas y que será necesaria su presencia allí para poder proteger a Rand al'Thor cuando éste se enfrente al Oscuro. Acompañado de su fiel amigo Gaul y de varios espíritus de lobos, Perrin se encuentra con su cuerpo físico en el Sueño del Lobo en el reflejo del valle de Thakan'dar, custodiando la entrada a Shayol Ghul ahora que Rand ha entrado allí y que el temible Verdugo sigue siendo una amenaza en aquel lugar. Desde su privilegiada posición en el Sueño del Lobo, Perrin descubre que Hessalam está dominando mediante sutil Compulsión la mente de los cuatro Grandes Capitanes, desbaratando la estrategia en todos los frentes de batalla a favor de la Sombra. Después de que los lobos le revelen que tras la apariencia de una vieja espantosa se encuentra en realidad el alma de Graendal, Perrin está ansi

bicicleta, cuchara, manzana | jabola y su cuaderno, el blog del bolo o el boloblog sideral Posted in JABOLANCIAS by jabola on 27 enero, 2011 En la entrada anterior os hablaba de un bello rincón que de un viejo solar se ha habilitado en Zaragoza en el encuentro de las calles Castelar, Santa Rosa y Maura. De entonces a ahora, hoy, he aprendido muchas cosas sobre el movimiento "estonoesunsolar" gracias a mis pesquisas y a la impagable orientación de Gordonkly ¡y que viva por siempre Dom Blecua! Amén. Y así, he sabido por la prensa que el tal no solar está dedicado a los niños y a los ancianos con alzehimer por lo que me siento doblemente concernido. Ese rincón es mi rincón: me gustan mucho los niños y lo proclamo a los cuatro vientos en estos tiempos tan azarosos y empiezo a tener agujeros en mi memoria que ríete tú de los del ozono antártico.

En noviembre de 2016 a Steven Seagal se le concedió la nacionalidad rusa y desde 2018 es representante de la Cancillería de dicho país. Por Cristián Meza 4 de Mayo, 2021 › 23:23 hrs En la oportunidad, el reconocido intérprete de películas de acción y artes marciales le hizo entrega de una espada samurái. Nicolás Maduro recibió en el Palacio de Miraflores de Caracas al conocido actor Steven Seagal, quien visitó Venezuela en su rol de representante especial del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de Rusia. En la oportunidad, el reconocido intérprete de películas de acción y artes marciales le hizo entrega de una espada samurái, lo que fue reconocido por el gobernante. "Complacido de recibir la grata visita del actor estadounidense, Steven Seagal. Sin duda alguna, Steven no es solo uno de los grandes del cine, también, es un dedicado luchador por la Paz de los pueblos. ¡Bienvenido!", indicó Maduro en redes sociales. Junto con ello, celebró el obsequio, planteando que la espada de origen japonés es un "símbolo de liderazgo. La recibí con mucha emoción de parte de un gran maestro y experto en artes marciales. ¡Qué Gran Honor!".

ProFoss para soja es un análisis de proceso y solución de control que proporciona mediciones continuas de humedad, proteína y contenido de aceite en la harina de soja directamente del proceso de producción. Le ayuda a mejorar la eficacia en una serie de puntos clave en el proceso de producción y al mismo tiempo mejorar la calidad y el beneficio. Obligatorio * Ahorre mas de 100.000€ al año reduciendo las variaciones en proteína.Ahorre mas de 100.000€ al año reduciendo las variaciones en humedad.Ahorre mas de 200.000€ al año reduciendo las variaciones en producción de aceite. Disminución de la variación de proteínas Al mover la proteína más cerca del objetivo un 0,5%, usted puede ahorrar 150.000 dólares EE.UU. al año (unos 100.000 €) (en base a una producción anual de 100.000 toneladas y un precio de harina de soja de EE.UU. $ 340/Ton). Debido a la exactitud y fiabilidad de ProFoss también puede tener plena confianza en las especificaciones de bajo, medio y alto contenido de proteínas en sus entregas. Disminución de la variación de humedad Del mismo modo, las mediciones continuas de humedad pueden ahorrar 150.000 dólares EE.UU. al año para ayudar a mover la humedad más cerca del objetivo del 0,5%, (en base a una producción anual de 100.000 toneladas y un precio de harina de soja de EE.UU. $ 340/Ton). La precisión de ProFoss permite que esto se haga con la confianza en relación con el contenido de humedad requerido del 12,5% o menos para evitar problemas de hongos en el almacenamiento y el transporte. Disminución de la variación del petróleo Los ahorros también se pueden hacer por mejorar el rendimiento a través de mediciones de contenido de aceite para asegurar el mejor equilibrio posible entre el contenido de aceite en la comida y la cantidad de petróleo extraído de primas para el consumo humano. Por ejemplo, ahorrar 300.000 dólares EE.UU. al mejorar el rendimiento de aceite en un 0,5% (basado en la producción anual de 100.000 toneladas y el precio de aceite comestible de 900 dólares EE.UU. y el preci

¿Por qué no habrá segundo aguinaldo? - Gary A. Rodríguez A. 2019-12-05 - 22:33:38 A fines de octubre pasado el Instituto Nacional de Estadística (INE) dio a conocer el indicador del crecimiento interanual del Producto Interno Bruto (PIB), un dato añorado por unos y temidopor otros, ya que -de superar el 4,5% entre julio de 2018 y junio de 2019- implicaría el pago de un segundo aguinaldo en esta gestión, acorde al D.S. 1802. Quienes esperaban que el INE confirmara una expansión de la economía boliviana superior al 4,5% eran los trabajadores, mientras que -paradójicamente- los que temían tal confirmación -y hasta algunos "cruzaban los dedos"- eran los empresarios, principalmente Mipymes, al ser los más vulnerables a la hora de honrar tal obligación. Para tristeza de unos y alivio de otros, el INE informó que el PIB boliviano solo creció un 3,38% entre julio/2018 y junio/2019, por lo que este año no habrá doble aguinaldo. Cabe aclarar que sobre dicho resultado no influyeron, ni los incendios en varios Departamentos así como tampoco el paro cívico ni la convulsión social que vivió el país, pues tales sucesos se dieron fuera del período interanual considerado, aunque su impacto negativo sobre el PIB del 2019 está, absolutamente, fuera de toda duda. La desaceleración de la tasa de crecimiento del PIB es un hecho: en 2013 creció 6,8%; en 2014 un 5,5%; el 2015 bajó al 4,9%; en 2016 disminuyó al 4,3%; entre 2017 y 2018 se estancó en un 4,2% y para este año las cosas no iban mejor con una tasa de apenas 3,13% al primer semestre del 2019, como informara el INE. Ya para mediados de año el pronóstico del FMI, Banco Mundial y CEPAL era bajista (3,8% al 4%), pero hoy es peor. Un escenario externo complicado con presiones sobre los precios hacia la baja (disputa comercial EEUU-China, baja del dinamismo de la economía, recesiones, devaluaciones en derredor, menor demanda de gas natural), un año electoral en Bolivia (que siempre afecta la economía, por la incertidumbre) y los dramáticos sucesos ya referidos (incendios, paro cívico, convulsión social), dieron al traste con el pronóstico del 4,5%. De confirmarse la optimista tasa del 3% estaríamos ante el quinto menor creci

Después de una larga siesta, donde costaba distinguir un vino de otro, una nueva generación de Chardonnay chilenos despierta nuestro entusiasmo, profundizando en la cepa y en las particularidades de sus distintos terruños. El presente de la cepa es promisorio, pero lo mejor aún está por venir. Estuvo descuidado. Perdido. Travestido. El Chardonnay, una de las cuatro cepajes fundamentales de la vitivinicultura posmoderna, no encontraba su justo medio. Jugaba en los extremos, con un ritmo cansino, predecible, empujado por las modas imperantes, sin desarrollar una personalidad propia ni menos profundizar en sus distintos orígenes. Cuando se plantó en Casablanca, a principios de la década del 80, pensábamos que su fortuna cambiaría. Incluso, intuíamos, que sería la principal cepa del primer valle costero de Chile y la bandera de los blancos chilenos. Sin embargo, se cometieron muchos errores. Algunos de ellos por omisión, pero otros derechamente fueron un impúdico atentado contra su naturaleza. Alentados por el estilo californiano que dominó a partir de la década del 90, vinos gorditos y dulzones, maquillados con una madera con desvaríos hollywoodenses, los Chardonnay chilenos se convirtieron en un commodity, en una pachanga tropical, en un homenaje a la vainillina, en unos fisiculturistas con músculos decorativos, incapaces de correr 50 metros planos sin presentar síntomas de ahogo. La receta se fotocopiaba y pasaba de mano en mano en las bodegas. Cosechar bien entrado el otoño, fermentaciones reductivas en estanques y luego un upper cut de barrica nueva que nos dejaba en la lona. Otro problema fue el material vegetativo. Como el Chardonnay estaba de moda, se propagaron indiscriminadamente las plantas que estaban más a la mano. Se trataba del tristemente célebre clon Mendoza, una selección masal que atravesó la cordillera sin dar nunca pruebas de blancura. Con aromas demasiado estridentes, y una mezquina acidez, no era el clon para estrenar la nueva generación de Chardonnay chilenos. Hoy se pagan los platos rotos. Muchas de aquellas plantaciones, luego de superar la adolescencia, muestran signos de una vejez prematura, obligando a los viticultores a labores de replantes y a un desesperado juego de ensayo y error con la importación de nuevos clones franceses. El Chardonnay ya no goza de la incontrarrestable popularidad de antaño -el Sauvignon Blanc lo ha eclipsado incluso en Casablanca-, pero este cepaje vuelve a resurgir con mucha fuerza en los últimos diez o quizás cinco años. La introducción de plantas clonales y patrones, que se han adaptado a las distintas condiciones de suelo y tolerantes a plagas como los nemátodos, sumado a la búsqueda de nuevos conceptos enológicos, han provocado un vuelco cualitativo que se deja sentir en nariz, pero sobre todo en boca. Aunque aún no logra su consolidación definitiva, y aún encontramos una masa uniforme que baila al ritmo de las cambiantes preferencias de los mercados, cada vez son más los enólogos que han decidido tomarse el Chardonnay en serio, buscando su propio camino, su propia identidad. La vuelta de los fudres y tinajas, de fermentaciones más lentas y oxidativas, y en general el objetivo enológico de construir bocas más firmes y profundas, no sólo permiten alcanzar nuevos umbrales de calidad, sino vinos que pueden crecer con el tiempo, alcanzando otros sabores, otros matices, otras complejidades. El descubrimiento y consolidación de nuevas zonas vitícolas, como los valles de Limarí, en el norte, y Malleco, en el sur, también han abierto el abanico de posibilidades para esta cepa que hoy se reinventa para mostrar la mejor de sus caras. El respeto al tiempo durante el proceso, la pérdida del miedo al oxígeno, el uso más razonable de la madera, y un genuina búsqueda por resaltar las particularidades únicas de los distintos orígenes, han dado vida a una nueva camada de Chardonnay que despierta entusiasmo y, en ciertos casos, incluso logra emocionar. Es el vino que más me gusta de esta joven bodega del Limarí. Es el más radical y jugado de la dupla conformada por Felipe Müller y Héctor Rojas. Intenso y fresco, como pocos, quizás como ninguno. Cítrico y con un retrogusto salino que hace salivar, invitándonos a beber una nueva, una nueva, una nueva copa. Proveniente de la zona de Fray Jorge, a sólo 12 kilómetros del océano, este vino es hijo de la tiza, la camanchaca y el viento. A 19 kilómetros del mar, al norte del río Limarí, Quebrada Seca se ha convertido en un barrio de lujo para los Chardonnay chilenos. Y De Martino y su enólogo Marcelo Retamal han sabido resaltar las características de este paisaje desértico, donde las parras son manchones verdes en un suelo de tonos anaranjados y blancos. En un año de mucha concentración, este vino muestra su lado más potente y mineral. Es el vino que lidera el portafolio de Maycas. Y con todos los merecimientos. Es un Chardonnay intenso y concentrado. Mientras su nariz es elegante, llena de sutilezas, su boca muestra todo su poder y profundidad de sabores. Sin duda el enólogo Marcelo Papa ha consolidado su relación amorosa con el valle y la cepa. Es un vino bien trabajado, que abre el apetito, que invita a esperar… a disfrutar de su gran potencial de guarda. Proveniente del viñedo Las Petras, a sólo 10 kilómetros del mar, este Chardonnay es todo un referente del valle. No sólo reafirma la vocación de Casablanca por la cepa, sino que muestra una nueva dimensión en términos de fineza y profundidad. La mano de Ignacio Recabarren se hace notar. Es un vino de mucha complejidad aromática, pero por sobre todo con una exquisita textura. Este vino es un tributo a la paciencia. Al respeto por la cepa y sus tiempos. Charly Villard no tiene prisas y lo demuestra con este Chardonnay que demoró casi un año su proceso de fermentación en barricas de roble francés. Con uvas de Tapihue y Ovalle, en el corazón de Casablanca, seduce por su cremosidad, por su complejidad de sabores, por su consecuencia. Este vino de domicilio. Casablanca por Manzanar (Aconcagua Costa). Y ganó en complejidad, pero sobre todo en frescura y profundidad de sabores. Fermentado con levaduras nativas, el enólogo Francisco Baettig revela otros aromas, explora otros registros. Con sus tonos lácteos y notas de flores y miel, sumado a una potente acidez, juega con nuestros sentidos, mostrándose a veces goloso, a veces profundamente fresco. Proveniente del viñedo San Juan, ubicado a 900 metros de altura, este vino es el buque insignia de la nueva generación de blancos del llamado Muy Alto Maipo. Es un vino austero en aromas, pero con una tremenda estructura. Vinificado por el enólogo Felipe Uribe, este Chardonnay profundiza su relación con la precordillera, encajonando sus vientos para emprender una larga travesía por nuestro paladar. En el sector de Coya, entre las montañas del Alto Cachapoal, donde los días son más cortos y la relación con la naturaleza es más íntima, nace este Chardonnay que vuelve a los orígenes de la enología. Fermentado en barricas de roble francés, este vino coquetea con el oxígeno para entregar aromas y sabores voluptuosos, dulces, pero apoyados por una firme acidez. Es un vino hecho a la antigua, como le gusta decir a su enólogo Francois Massoc. En Itata se fundó la vitivinicultura chilena y hoy se reinventa, estiliza, reencuentra con sus raíces para demostrar su tremendo potencial. Este Chardonnay de la zona de Larqui, cuyas plantaciones se remontan a 1992 y se manejan a la ant

Jirga - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre Para el pueblo en Irán, véase Jirgah. Una jirga regional en Jalalabad, Afganistán. Una jirga (ocasionalmente jarga o jargah; pastún: جرګه) es una asamblea tradicional de líderes que toman decisiones por consenso y de acuerdo con las enseñanzas del Islam. Es anterior a las leyes escritas de hoy en día y se lleva a cabo para resolver las disputas entre el pueblo pastún, y en menor medida entre otros grupos cercanos que han sido influenciados por los pastunes (históricamente conocidos como los afganos). Su objetivo principal ha sido evitar las guerras tribales. La mayoría de las jirgas se llevan a cabo en Afganistán, y también entre las tribus pastunes en el vecino Pakistán, especialmente en las Áreas Tribales bajo Administración Federal (ATAF) y Jaiber Pajtunjuá. El consejo de la comunidad puede servir de instrumento para dirimir una disputa entre dos personas; siendo parte del mecanismo de resolución de controversias en este tipo de casos. Los litigantes suelen empezar con la búsqueda de un mediador, que suele ser un importante líder religioso, un notable local o un especialista en mediación (un kan o malik). El mediador escucha a las dos partes y luego forma una jirga de ancianos de la comunidad, teniendo cuidado de incluir partidarios de ambos lados. La jirga entonces considera el caso y, después de discutir el asunto, llega a una decisión acerca de cómo manejar la situación, que el mediador entonces anuncia. La conclusión de las jirgas es obligatoria. La jirga también fue utilizada como tribunal en los casos de conducta criminal, pero este uso está siendo sustituido por los tribunales formales en algunas zonas pobladas de Pakistán y Afganistán, aunque en regiones tribales todavía se la utiliza como tribunal. La jirga tiene el prestigio de un tribunal en las áreas tribales de Pakistán. Aunque existen agentes políticos nombrados por el gobierno nacional para mantener la ley y el orden a través del Reglamento de Crímenes de la Frontera, lo hace con la ayuda de la jirga, residiendo el poder real en esta última. El agente político mantiene la ley y el orden en su región tribal con la ayuda de las jirgas. La jirga puede imponer la pena capital, como la muerte por lapidación en caso de adulterio, o la expulsión de la comunidad. El Tribunal Superior de Sindh decretó una prohibición de la celebración de jirgas en abril de 2004,[1]​ debido a las condenas a veces inhumanas otorgadas a las personas, especialmente hacia las mujeres y los hombres que se casan por su propia voluntad. La prohibición, sin embargo, ha sido ignorada.[2]​ En las recientes operaciones militares contra Al Qaeda y los talibanes en las zonas tribales problemáticas de la frontera sur de Pakistán con Afganistán, las jirgas jugaron un papel clave como moderadoras entre el gobierno y los militantes. La tradición de la jirga también ha sido adoptada por los musulmanes en el valle de Cachemira en la zona administrada por la India.[3]​ Una jirga exclusivamente femenina ("consejo de hermanas") se formó en Pakistán, constituida por 25 miembros.[4]​ Fue encabezada por Tabbassum Adnan, y ayudó a 11 mujeres que recibieron justicia a partir de 2013.[4]​[5]​ Loya jirga ("Gran jirga"), una gran jirga llamada para discutir un caso particularmente importante. Wolesi Jirga ("Jirga Popular"), la cámara baja de la legislatura afgana. Meshrano Jirga ("Jirga de Ancianos"), la cámara alta de la legislatura afgana. Paz Jirga Afgana 2010 Nanawatai (nanawate), que significa "santuario". Shura, el equivalente árabe de la jirga. ↑ SBLR 2004 Sindh 918; e

Enloszapatosdesan: junio 2014 Hola y feliz finde a todos. Como me gusta combinar cualquier prenda roja con los labios rojos. Me parece que lucen muchísimo más que con cualquier otro color de ropa, aunque unos labios rojos siempre dan el toque sexy. Esta camisa me encanta, tiene una caída increíble, la forma de los bolsillos y los detalles en los hombros la hacen diferente y sobre todo ese tono de rojo que tiene, rojo pasión. Las blusas son una prenda perfecta y que nunca puede faltar en un fondo de armario, por lo menos en mi caso, me saca de muchos apuros cuando no encuentro que ponerme. Short y bolso: Primark Publicado por Sandra Ferrando en 16:14 No hay comentarios: Hola. Aunque no pudimos sacar muchas fotos ayer, quería mostraros este vestido, llamado "GANGA". Cuando estuve en Tenerife, pase un día por Benetton y ví este vestido, me gustó porque era fresquito, la forma de la parte de abajo me pareció súper original, con los bolsillos haciendo una especie de falda y el color es precioso. Lo mejor, su precio, que da vergüenza hasta decirlo. Estaba a 1 euro, y no recuerdo su precio original, pero eran más de 30 euros, seguro. Así que no me lo pensé, salí de allí contenta y con la cartera solo un poco menos cargada. Como digo siempre "Quien no se viste, es porque no quiere" Y encima, a mi chico le encantó cuando me lo puse, y no es fácil.

Warhamster Society: septiembre 2009 Peanas de molde Hoy me he puesto a hacer pruebas de pintura con mis enanos ( ya la publicaré) y al pegarlo a la peana he recordado que hace tiempo hice el tutorial de como hacer peanas de molde y aun estaba por ahi, asi que aprovecho y lo cuelgo aqui :P. Pongo sólo el link en lugar de las fotos porque son muchas! Tras mucho tiempo pensando en como haría las peanas de mis enanos y las de mis elfos de warhammer, llegué a ver la luz el otro día. las voy a hacer tal que así: http://usuarios.lycos.es/eltallerderiklok/fotos%20ws/peanas%20enanos%20wip%20a.JPG Pero hacer todas las peanas una a una me llevaría mucho tiempo, las miniaturas son difíciles de sujetar a la pizarra, y el dueño de una casa que yo me sé se quejaría de goteras al faltarle un trozo de su tejado, por lo que decidí hacer moldes pare poder hacerlas rápidamente.

La humedad de cimientos tiene consecuencias importantes para la salud, genera gastos en costosas reparaciones, disminuye considerablemente el valor del inmueble, incrementa el consumo de energía y además resulta en manchas y lesiones antiestéticas en las paredes de su propiedad. El exceso de humedad puede provocar alergias y aumenta la posibilidad de contraer enfermedades respiratorias. En personas que ya padecen asma, alergias, bronquitis o enfermedades reumáticas, un ambiente húmedo puede agravar aún más el problema y acentuar dolores. En una casa con humedad siempre estará gastando dinero en reparaciones contínuas de las lesiones. El consumo energético de los aparatos de calefacción aumenta de forma notable. Algunos objetos de valor como cuadros, muebles y pisos de parquet se deterioran con facilidad. El moho es un organismo microscópico vegetal que se reproduce en presencia de humedad por la difusión de esporas en el aire, las cuales pueden originar asma o agravar el estado de quienes la padecen. La humedad puede reducir hasta en un 30% o más de valor de un inmueble, especialmente si padece de humedad de cimientos. Es por ello que un tratamiento adecuado contra la humedad de cimientos es siempre una inversión rentable. La ironía y el humor resultan hech

El Papa concede personalidad jurídica canónica pública a Caritas Internationalis 2004-11-17 11:36:55 Juan Pablo II ha concedido la personalidad jurídica canónica pública a Caritas Internationalis, vinculándola más estrechamente a Su persona y a la Santa Sede. Y favoreciendo así una colaboración más eficaz con el Pontificio Consejo Cor Unum, dicasterio al que el Santo Padre ha confiado la tarea de promover y coordinar las iniciativas de las instituciones católicas en el campo humanitario. Cor Unum "contribuirá así a mantener vivo el espíritu eclesial en la Confederación de Caritas, dado el papel eclesial de esta benemérita institución, y en particular vigilará la actividad de los miembros de la misma, que se desarrollará en coordinación internacional y en colaboración directa con las Iglesias locales y sus Pastores". Asimismo, Caritas Internacional por su actividad caritativa a nivel mundial, sobre todo ante los organismos internacionales y en zonas del mundo en dificultad, siempre hará referencia a la Secretaría de Estado. Por la especial vinculación de Caritas Internationalis con la Santa Sede, la lista de los candidatos a la función de presidente y secretario general de la Confederación tendrán que ser sometidos a la aprobación del Papa. El Santo Padre ha confirmado los Estatutos y el Reglamento de Caritas, que, sin embargo, tendrán que ser interpretados a la luz de lo que establece el quirógrafo 'Durante la Última Cena'. Documento p

Sam Neill, Laura Dern y Jeff Goldblum estarán en 'Jurassic World 3' | Las Horas Perdidas Sam Neill, Laura Dern y Jeff Goldblum estarán en 'Jurassic World 3' 25/09/19 a las 8:19 Algo más de 25 años e, imaginamos, un cheque considerable, es lo que ha hecho falta para volver a juntar a los tres protagonistas de Jurassic Park en una nueva entrega de la saga. El anuncio se ha oficializado en una proyección del corto Battle at Big Rock, en la que la propia Dern ha sido la encargada de confirmar su regreso y el de sus compañeros. Los tres actores habían aparecido en distintas secuelas de la saga, pero nunca juntos. El último de ellos fue Goldblum, en lo que casi era un cameo, en la Jurassic World: El reino caído. Parece que en esta ocasión sus personajes serán algo más relevantes, pero no sabemos aún hasta q

Mueven a Morelia por la Paz con certificación de instructores de Feeling dance – La Pagina Noticias Mueven a Morelia por la Paz con certificación de instructores de Feeling dance Morelia, Michoacán.- El alcalde de Morelia, Wilfrido Lázaro Medina, encabezó la mañana de este sábado, el arranque de la segunda etapa de certificación para instructores de Feeling Dance en el municipio, reconocimiento que durante su primera fase obtuvieron 70 entrenadores que a través del baile movieron por la paz a ciudadanos de 36 colonias. "En la vida todos somos maestros y todos somos alumnos al mismo tiempo; tenemos algo que dar y mucho que recibir con humildad. Ustedes están dando muestra de que nos educamos juntos y trabajamos en solidaridad", afirmó el edil moreliano luego de hacer la entrega simbólica de certificados en la plaza Melchor Ocampo de la capital michoacana. Ante decenas de mujeres y hombres que acudieron al Centro Histórico para participar también en una mega clase de Feeling Dance, Lázaro Medina expresó: "Yo los convoco para que, orgullosos de ser morelianos, mantengamos esta actitud de tender la mano, de ayudarnos entre nosotros. Que si alguien tiene una necesidad, entre todos los vecinos vayamos y apoyemos" Feeling Dance fue creada por José Navarro Magallanes y forma parte del programa federal Redes de Organización Vecinal que opera la Dirección de Enlace Ciudadano del Ayuntamiento de Morelia para mover al muni

EPISOL accionista de Covioriente, fue sancionada e inhabilitada para contratar por 10 años, ésta pendiente de fallo del Consejo de Estado. – Violeta Stereo Casanare Home » Noticias » EPISOL accionista de Covioriente, fue sancionada e inhabilitada para contratar por 10 años, ésta pendiente de fallo del Consejo de Estado. EPISOL accionista de Covioriente, fue sancionada e inhabilitada para contratar por 10 años, ésta pendiente de fallo del Consejo de Estado. Covioriente, sociedad integrada por las empresas colombianas EPISOL (con el 60% de participación) y CONCECOL (40%), ambas firmas de Corficolombiana, están a cargo de la ejecución del contrato de concesión bajo el esquema de Alianza Público Privada APP No 010, cuyo propósito es desarrollar el eje viario que conecta la capital del departamento del Meta, Villavicencio, con la capital del departamento de Casanare. Sin embargo, el pasado el pasado 14 de diciembre la misma Corporación Financiera Colombiana S.A. Corficolombiana, advirtió a sus filiales de la decisión de primera instancia del Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca, sobre la acción popular que la Procuraduría General de la Nación instauró en contra de la Agencia Nacional de Infraestructura, la Concesionaria Ruta del Sol S.A.S. ("CRDS"), sus accionistas y algunas personas naturales. Donde expone que: "El accionista mayoritario de CRDS es la firma Odebrecht, quien confesó el pago de sobornos en éste y en otros proyectos ejecutados en varios países" que, "Según el fallo, EPISOL, filial de Corficolombiana y accionista minoritario de CRDS, al igual que otras personas jurídicas y naturales, es declarado responsable solidariamente por la supuesta vulneración de los derechos colectivos a la moralidad administrativa y a la defensa del patrimonio público, por un monto de $800.156.144.362,50 pesos.

Sanz afirma que ANV no tenía que haber estado en los ayuntamientos y considera "acertado" que se adopten medidas | Últimas noticias de la actualidad cultural en Diario de Navarra Sanz afirma que ANV no tenía que haber estado en los ayuntamientos y considera "acertado" que se adopten medidas El jefe del Ejecutivo foral propuso que se planteen mociones de censura "tras acuerdos adoptados por los partidos democráticos allá donde se pueda" Actualizada Viernes, 5 de diciembre de 2008 - 12:22 h. El presidente del Gobierno de Navarra, Miguel Sanz, afirmó hoy que ANV no tenía que haber estado en los ayuntamientos y que le parece, por tanto, una medida "acertada" que se reclame la disolución de los consistorios gobernados por la formación ilegalizada. Según dijo en declaraciones a los medios de comunicación, es preciso "utilizar todos los mecanismos legales a nuestro alcance para poder apartar a ANV de las instituciones y si no existe posibilidad de hacerlo a través de la aplicación de la ley, que se haga a través de iniciativas políticas". En este sentido, propuso que se planteen mociones de censura "tras acuerdos adoptados por los partidos democráticos allá donde se pueda porque ANV no tenga mayoría absoluta" o bien se adopten otro tipo de iniciativas "para no dejarse apoyar tampoco por este partido para tomar ciertas cotas de poder". A su juicio, "es muy frecuente que a las horas de cometerse un atentado como el asesinato de Ignacio Uría todos los partidos salgan diciendo que van a rechazar a ANV, pero a los dos o tres días se han olvidado de todo". "Las iniciativas y el pensamiento y las posiciones políticas tienen que estar basadas en la coherencia", manifestó. Miguel Sanz afirmó que UPN siempre ha dicho que no apoyará ni se dejará apoyar por ANV. "Y no posibilitaremos que nadie de nuestra organización acceda a las instituciones basándose en posiciones pasivas o activas de ANV, de todos aquellos que no creen en la democracia y en las libertades", dijo. El presidente navarro se mostró además "completamente de acuerdo" con la iniciativa del PSN de pedir a Nafarroa Bai que no se apoye en ANV. "NaBai, que tiene algunos ayuntamientos gracias al apoyo de ANV, activo o pasivo, debería reconsiderar esta posición y hacerlo de la manera más rápida posible", señaló. "Incluso en algunos ayuntamientos, investidos del carácter de independientes, está ocurriendo lo mismo", dijo par

Mayo 28, 2019 - 18:05 Bogotá, 28 may (EFE).- El Gobierno colombiano y representantes del sector privado presentaron este martes una alianza para sustituir por café los cultivos ilícitos sembrados en una localidad del departamento de Nariño, fronterizo con Ecuador. "Familias que antes estaban atormentadas por los cultivos ilícitos han encontrado aquí un espacio para dejar el camino de la ilegalidad y entrar al de la legalidad", afirmó el presidente colombiano, Iván Duque, en la presentación de la alianza, en la que también participa la Federación Nacional de Cafeteros (FNC), Nespresso y la Fundación Howard Buffett. Duque destacó que se contempla un esquema de agricultura por contrato en el que se establece un "precio fijo, justo, que les permite tener sostenibilidad en el tiempo" para mejorar su calidad de vida. "Por otro lado es una oportunidad que queremos se expanda en todo el territorio nacional", acotó el jefe de Estado, quien agregó que el programa va a fu

Dubái tendrá una flota de taxis drones en julio - America Noticias Volar en un taxi-dron será una realidad en esa ciudad de los Emiratos Árabes Unidos. ¡Qué envidia! Volar en un taxi será una realidad en Dubái No, no se trata del carro volador de Harry Potter. Dubái contará con taxis drones voladores que transportarán a personas a partir de julio próximo, así lo anunció el fabricante chino de drones EHang, encargado de suministrar este tipo de transporte a la capital de los Emiratos Árabes Unidos. El objetivo de Dubái es que el 25% del transporte sea sin conductor en el 2030. Asimismo, agilizar los desplazamientos y terminar con la contaminación. (Video tomado de PlayGround) En caso de problemas técnicos en vuelo, los vehículos están programados para posarse en la zona segura más cercana, y la comunicación entre las máquinas y el centro de control está encriptado, según la compañía. Dubái, la mayor ciudad de los Emiratos Árabes Unidos, quiere convertirse en una ciu

LA FERIA DE LA INFORMACION: Cultura: YO LEO, ¿TÚ LEES? ¿NOSOTROS LEEMOS? Cultura: YO LEO, ¿TÚ LEES? ¿NOSOTROS LEEMOS? Joaquín Salvador Lavado(Quino) Ayer por la tarde, más por obligación que por gusto mío, empecé a arreglar mis estantes de libros. No se trata precisamente de una biblioteca, pues son muy pocos mis libros para llegar a ser una: apenas unos doscientos libros de todas las épocas. Limpiando cada uno de ellos recordé las horas de placer que me han regalado y el refugio que han representado para mí en diferentes momentos de mi vida, grandes compañeros que me dieron grandes lecciones. He leído desde que aprendí que las pequeñas letras podían significar algo y nunca he parado. Mi abuelo sí tenía una biblioteca, toda una habitación llena de libros que nunca me pidió leer: él, aun al borde de la ceguera, sólo leía frente a mí, y eso fue más que suficiente, empecé por imitarlo y acabé disfrutándolo. Tardes y tardes enteras nos sentamos en un cuarto miniatura de dos por tres metros, a leer cada cual un libro... ocasionalmente me comentaba algo de lo que él leía y despertaba mis deseos de leer el libro que él había elegido. A veces se dormía con el libro en la mano, de tan viejito que estaba y yo aprovechaba para averiguar el título y anotarlo en una libretita que tenía con el nombre: "Los libros que el abue

Hyper Light Drifter - Análisis del juego de Switch - Revogamers.net Portada » Análisis » Hyper Light Drifter Javier Aranda 6 septiembre, 2018 0 me gusta Nintendo Switch se está convirtiendo en una consola que está acumulando todos los éxitos indies (y unos cuantos AAA) de los últimos años. Es como si dijésemos que está siendo la consola en la que está saliendo todo lo que no llegó a Wii U, además de títulos que también pasaron por la consola del GamePad. Además, esto trae consigo, en más de una ocasión, la versión definitiva del juego en cuestión, como es el caso de Hyper Light Drifter, que llega a la híbrida de la mano de los españoles Abylight. El extraño viaje de The Drifter En este título nos encontramos en un mundo abierto con cierta similaridad con los The Legend of Zelda clásicos, lleno de áreas secretas y con un gran número de atajos muy bien implementados (teletransportes) y un sistema de combate con espada – aunque añadiendo una pistola y un potente dash que permite no solo esquivar, sino también "saltar" pequeños abismos. El juego comienza presentando sus mecánicas con un breve y lineal tutorial y, una vez lo completamos, entramos en faena a tope. Poco a poco veremos nuevos tipos de enemigos que nos obligarán a mejorar nuestro arte de la esquiva y nuestra precisión con la espada y nuestras limitadas balas (que se recargan derrotando enemigos o rompiendo ciertos elementos del escenario). El juego tiene un gran equilibrio en los combates, sin llegar al exceso de ser un juego en el que solo se puede golpear 2 segundos tras un minuto esquivando. La dificultad está bastante ajustada, aunque bien es cierto que hay muchas ventajas que permiten que no haya que ser un maestro para jugar, como la posibilidad de poder curarse (si tenemos energía suficiente), el hecho de que hay una gran cantidad de checkpoints, y la inclusión de objetos especiales como las espadas duales, la túnica localizadora de coleccionables o disparos congelantes, extras de la versión de Nintendo Switch que conseguiremos tras completar cierto desafío. Una Special Edition para un gran juego El mundo de Hyper Light Drifter nos tendrá ocupados cerca de una decena de horas, aunque sus secretos pueden tenernos ocupados durante más tiempo; y si somos fans de los grandes retos, el modo Nuevo Juego + nos ofrecerá una visión más complicada de esta aventura. El universo nos atrapa de principio a fin gracias a su ambientación post-apocalíptica en la que máquinas y naturaleza conviven, y las secuencias que narran la historia son bastante llamativas, pero sí que es posible que tras jugarlo nos dé la sensación de que la historia podría haber sido más potente para el juego que nos ocupa. En cuanto a representación, estamos ante un juego precioso. Puede que muchos usuarios empiecen a hartarse del pixel-art, pero en esta ocasión se trata de un ya denominado clásico indie, que sabe ofrecer unos fondos preciosos utilizando su estilo gráfico particular. La banda sonora (propia de una gran película de ciencia ficción) y los efectos de sonido son un complemento bastante importante que terminan de coronar a esta aventura que funciona a 60 fps tanto en portátil como en modo TV.

La cartera se mantiene estable - ELESPECTADOR.COM La cartera se mantiene estable 19 Oct 2013 - 10:43 AM Según el último reporte de Estabilidad Financiera, el panorama de las actividades de los establecimientos de crédito es positivo. Luego de la desaceleración que se venía presentando desde finales de 2011, la cartera volvió a recuperar su ritmo y los resultados son consecuentes con la estable evolución que han mostrado los indicadores de calidad y de mora con respecto al año pasado. Según el más reciente reporte de Estabilidad Financiera del Banco de la República, "la cartera bruta creció a una tasa real anual de 13,3% en junio del año en curso, cifra superior a la observada en diciembre de 2012 (12,5%)". El documento reveló además que los empresarios del sector corporativo privado poco están pidiendo préstamos y que el mayor desempeño está en los altos niveles de endeudamiento y en la carga financiera de los hogares. De acuerdo con el Emisor, las distintas clases de entidades presentan un moderado crecimiento en las pérdidas potenciales por riesgo de mercado. Este comportamiento se explica por el alto uso de créditos de consumo distintos de las tarjetas de crédito, pues en los últimos meses se han registrado mayores exigencias por parte de las entidades financieras para aprobar préstamos. También, se debe a que la situación económica de los hogares es favorable según los indicadores de niveles de riqueza y de expectativas de los consumidores. Asimismo dejó ver que la disminución en el ritmo de crecimiento del margen de intereses y la caída de ingresos por valorización de inversiones provocó que la utilidad de los últimos 12 meses registrara menor dinámica que en 2012, en los pasivos resaltó el incremento de los bonos y los depósitos de cuentas corrientes y de ahorros. El reporte mostró que el crecimiento de las instituciones financieras no bancarias tuvo menor movimiento dentro del marco de desvalorizaciones de deuda púb

Diálogo UPR | UPR Bayamón adquiere poderoso "drone" para adiestrar a la Policía 9 de julio de 2021 Por DiálogoNoticias Con el propósito de adiestrar a Policía de Puerto Rico y personal de otras agencias del gobierno, la División de Educación Continua y Estudios Profesionales (DECEP-UPRB) de la Universidad de Puerto Rico de Bayamón (UPR-Bayamón) adquirió dos naves aéreas no tripuladas el "DJI Matrice 300 RTK V2 Combo" y DJI Mavic 2 Enterprise (Dual)". La adquisición de estos innovadores equipos se realizó con fondos provenientes del Programa de Capacitación de Servidores Públicos, establecido mediante alianza entre la Oficina de Administración y Transformación de los Recursos Humanos (OATRH) y el Sistema UPR, informó el rector, Dr. Miguel Vélez Rubio.

27 septiembre, 2013 Artículo escrito por: Diana Garcés Antes de que empieces a leer responde esta pregunta: ¿Qué es lo primero que se te viene a la cabeza cuando escuchas las palabras: "Amor líquido"? Resulta que aunque nunca lo hayas escuchado, este término fue desarrollado por el Sociólogo polaco Zygmunt Bauman y trata acerca de la fragilidad de los vínculos humanos, y con ello se describe el tipo de relaciones interpersonales que se desarrollan en la postmodernidad. Éstas, según el autor, están caracterizadas por la falta de solidez, calidez y por una tendencia a ser cada vez más fugaces, superficiales, etéreas y con menor compromiso… Las relaciones personales de nuestro tiempo Aunque nos cuesta reconocerlo, la verdad es que las relaciones ahora no duran lo que hace algunos años. Hoy en día, hay mucha más infidelidad, aunque yo a esto le agregaría, sobre todo, que se descubre mejor a los infieles que tiempo atrás. También hay menos personas resignadas, sobre todo las mujeres. Ellas hoy en día aguantan menos aquellos detalles que le incomodan y aunque muchas relaciones se sostienen por los hijos o la dependencia económica, cuando los primeros crecen, las separaciones no se hacen esperar. Además, debemos tener en cuenta que gracias a que los tiempos han cambiado y hay tanta información, las mujeres, sobre todo, ya no se casan sin saber qué esperar. Muchas de ellas viven antes con sus novios, para luego dar el paso definitivo, cosa que hace algunos años no se hacía y las mujeres se casaban vírgenes, "desinformadas" o con el primer hombre que le ofreciera seguridad y algo de estabilidad, así no hubiese afinidad y mucho menos amor. Igualmente, las personas no aguantan la desigualdad, con esto de que tanto hombres como mujeres trabajan por igual y a veces son ellas las que ganan más, hace que los hombres se sientan innecesarios y por ende inconformes en las relaciones que sostienen. La monotonía, también juega un papel importante en las relaciones hoy en día. Hace algún tiempo se aguantaba, porque "no había más", hoy en día es mal vista la monotonía y muchas personas huyen de ella a la primera oportunidad, o algunos años después cuando adquieren el valor necesario para decir que no aguantan más. El maltrato, tanto físico como psicológico, es algo con lo que se sigue luchando pero que cada vez se denuncia más o por lo menos hay más información de su existencia, dándole así una posibilidad de escapar de ello. A todo esto, hay que sumarle el tema del consumismo actual en nuestra sociedad, lo que hace que el amor Líquido sea tan común y parte de nuestra vida diaria, ya que muchas relaciones se construyen a través del frágil mundo de Internet. Algunas de estas relaciones no llegan a ser reales y otras se construyen durante años, para luego terminar en desilusión porque a la final no se conocía realmente a la otra persona. Aunque aquí, también hay que reconocer que hay algunas relaciones exitosas. Estoy segura que El señor Bauman no pensó en todo esto cuando creó el concepto, por eso lo que acaban de leer no se acerca a lo que realmente significa el Amor líquido. Esto es lo que yo imagino cuando pienso en ello. Pondré entre mis pendientes leer más al respecto, porque me parece que es un término interesante para referirse a las relaciones interpersonales que podemos ver hoy en día. Tras responder la pregunta inicial y leer esta nota ¿se parece en algo lo que tu pensabas del concepto de amor líquido a lo que yo pienso de él? Te recomiendo este post de Francisco Fortuño que habla sobre la clase de amor que a mí me encanta imaginar que es posible: Deja que el amor te mueva 2 agosto, 2016 at 5:15 Hola! vaya, yo creía que el amor líquido tenia algo que ver con eso de fluir y dejarse llevar y resulta que es eso mismo pero con el consumismo y con la falta de solidez de la pareja. Bueno pues disfrutemos de lo que tenemos mientras podemos aunque la verdad es que ese concepto no va mucho conmigo. Besos!! 6 agosto, 2016 at 11:10 Guapa, creo que es como nosotros entendamos al final la palabra. Yo también tuve mucha confusión con ella, pero no me quedo con lo que otros dicen solamente, a veces puedes darle tu toque a estas palabras "raras" 🙂 2 agosto, 2016 at 22:48 coincido con María, pensé que el amor líquido se refería básicamente a eso… Dejarse llevar, fluir en consonancia… Vamos, no me hacía al hecho de ser algo negativo. Claro que hoy en día, existe mucha infidelidad, mucho egoísmo también, entre otras cosas. Es más, a mi más de una ocasión, me preguntaban que si yo estaba con mi marido por el dinero… Cuando ambos cuando empezamos a salir estábamos trabajando por cuenta ajena y sin apenas nada…. Pero oye, que hay mucha negatividad. Ahora que eso sí, es imprescindible vivir y disfrutar cada momento, cada día y de todo cuanto tenemos en nuestra vida en nuestros días. Considero que si hubiese más respeto todo sería más bello… Pero bueno, hay de todo en la viña del señor, ¿verdad? 6 agosto, 2016 at 11:17 Guapa, es muy cierto si respetáramos más y dejáramos de meternos tanto en la vida de los demás y disfrutáramos más de la nuestra, si aprendiéramos más sobre nosotros mismos más que sobre los demás, seríamos más felices, confiaríamos más en la felicidad auténtica y sobre todo viviríamos de otra manera las relaciones que tenemos. Un abrazo guapa y gracias por tu comentario, siempre aprendemos de aquí y de allí 🙂 3 agosto, 2016 at 1:29 Coincido con que la monotonía desgasta mucho las relaciones y las hacen aburridas, tambi

Sello Safe Travels: ¡El sello internacional como un destino turístico seguro para viajar ante el Covid-19! – Blog Viagens Machu Picchu Este 1 de noviembre en medio del imponente Machu Picchu, Perú recibió el Sello Safe Travels, que acredita que está considerado como uno de los destinos más seguros para visitar y hacer turismo. Esta certificación fue entregada en medio de una ceremonia especial andina encabezada por autoridades peruanas y desde Londres, y de manera virtual por la presidenta del Consejo Mundial de Viajes y Turismo o WWTC. Con este título, Perú se convirtió en el tercer país latinoamericano en recibir esta distinción como país seguro para viajar, luego de Ecuador y Brasil. Luego de cumplir con los lineamientos e implementar los protocolos de higiene y seguridad con los más altos estándares del sector privado global. El objetivo de esta certificación es contribuir a la recuperación del sector de turismo; una vez que la autoridades y lo hayan determinado y cumplan con las condiciones necesarias para la reactivación del sector. Así el gobierno del Cusco hizo las gestiones necesarias para cumpliendo las medidas y siguiendo las directrices y lineamientos de la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) y del Centro para el control y prevención de enfermedades, que cuenta con el respaldo de la OMT. Así Perú se suma a la lista de los países más distinguidos según el WWTC, y además encabeza la lista de los destinos de viaje m

Conectar Igualdad: más social y cultural que educativo - Marcha - Una mirada popular de la Argentina y el mundo Conectar Igualdad: más social y cultural que educativo Educación Miércoles, 01 Agosto 2012 00:05 Tweet Maximiliano Duquelsky, un investigador de la UBA que estudia la relación entre comunicación y educación, conversó con Marcha acerca de uno de los programas más ambiciosos del Estado nacional.. - ¿Cómo analizás el programa "Conectar Igualdad"? ¿Se lo puede caracterizar como una política educativa, una política social o una política cultural? ¿O es una mezcla de las tres? Comienzo por afirmar mi acuerdo con que se distribuyan netbooks entre la población que no puede acceder a esta tecnología por motivos económicos, pero resaltar continuamente esta acción como el aspecto principal de una política educativa ya es otra cuestión. Si tuviera que definir el programa Conectar Igualdad (CI) con una fórmula, diría que tiene mucho más de política social y cultural, que de política educativa. No es la primera vez que se intenta en Argentina o en Latinoamérica encarar la solución de problemáticas educativas, sociales o culturales mediante acciones de modernización tecnológica. Diría entonces que CI posee varias características de una política social tendiente a disminuir el impacto de las desigualdades económicas en el ejercicio de un derecho. Me refiero al acceso a las nuevas tecnologías y al mundo virtual y digital, mediante una acción del Estado. Por supuesto, no es posible llevar adelante una política educativa en este terreno sin una infraestructura acorde. Pero cuando uno ingresa al portal del programa puede comprobar inmediatamente que el discurso está claramente sostenido sobre las cifras de netbooks entregadas, como si fueran cantidades de calles asfaltadas o casas con cloacas. Esto genera, en el corto plazo, un enorme impacto positivo para el Gobierno y el Estado en el plano simbólico como consecuencia del imaginario tecnológico que atraviesa nuestra era y hace que veamos la modernización como positiva en sí misma, dificultando reflexionar sobre cuestiones efectivamente edu

Los vecinos del ático. Before & After de un proyecto lleno de inspiración – El ático de Daniela – Estudio Es increíble como, a veces, sin pretenderlo, sirves de inspiración a otros para realizar un cambio de vida y lograr la casa de sus sueños. Esto es lo que les sucedió a unos buenos amigos, que conocieron nuestro ático hace un año y medio, en una fiesta de inauguración en la que quisimos compartir nuestra emoción de estrenar doble ático, nuestro piso y el ático de Daniela. A medida que les enseñábamos los distintos rincones, veíamos un brillo en sus ojos. Esa noche, salieron del ático con la semillita que les haría plantearse el gran cambio. Tras meses dando pasos con la propiedad de nuestro edificio, eligiendo el piso adecuado y celebrando que comenzaban este nuevo proyecto, me dieron la gran alegría de saber que querían que me ocupara de todo el proyecto integral! 185 m2 de maravilloso piso en ruinas! Nos inspiramos en líneas limpias y marcadas, que acentuaban el luminoso blanco de las paredes para conseguir un Minimalismo Chic, presente en toda la decoración. Las maravillosas piezas y accesorios de House Doctor nos ayudaron a potenciar, sin duda, la personalidad de la estructura de la casa, con ese toque de sobriedad y contundencia que les caracteriza. Bocetos del diseño Todo el almacenaje es de IKEA (Mueble TV Besta, Vitrina Billy y Aparador Stockholm). Las lámparas de comedor, aparador, butaca terciopelo + puf en Green, Troley de bebidas y accesorios son de House Doctor. Cortinas grises en tejido de visillo de Gancedo a medida. Mesas y sillas de la firma Dhomeklub. En toda la casa se han conservado y restaurado las puertas y molduras originales. Como en toda la casa, el negro y blanco acompaña al diseño, ademas de dos lámparas globo a distintas alturas con bombillas de filamento vintage. El gran armario de la entrada se restauró para conservar este útil rincón de almacenaje. El aparador es el famoso IKEA PS metálico. Banco con capitoné en piel de House Doctor, lámpara articulada de Singular Market y cuadro con elevaciones de edificios de New York de la firma Sueca My Guide to. Cambiamos la puerta de entrada a la suite hasta el pasillo para ganar luz en este extremo de la casa. El gran tamaño de esta estancia nos permitió crear varios ambientes, la zona de descanso, el vestidor y mi rincón preferido, el Make up Corner, una petición que me hizo Mónica para maquillarse con luz natural cada mañana. Cortinas blancas en tejido de visillo a medida de Gancedo. Lámparas, mesillas, alfombra, cojines, urna, mesa make up y espejo House Doctor. Butaca Maisons du M

Entre otros, la Hidroeléctrica del Río Sogamoso, proyecto estimado en $ 2 billones y cuyo embalse entrará en operación comercial a finales del 2014; la Ruta del Sol, una de las obras de infraestructura más importantes de Latinoamérica por su recorrido e impacto sobre los tiempos y costos de transporte y que, con una inversión de alrededor de $ 6 billones, une el centro del país con la Costa Atlántica, y la Gran Vía Yuma, con una inversión de $ 260 mil millones, que conectará el oriente con el occidente del país. La lista sigue: están el Proyecto de Plataforma Logística Multimodal, el Plan Maestro de Industria, el Plan Portuario para Barrancabermeja y lo que se ha denominado la Súper Vía, que es la conexión Barrancabermeja / Bucaramanga. A la par con el inicio de estos proyectos se encuentra el Plan de Modernización de la Refinería de Barrancabermeja. Esta ampliación aprobada por la Junta Directiva de Ecopetrol, permitirá que la refinería procese 180 mil barriles de crudo pesado cada día, aumente en 20 puntos su factor de conversión, produzca combustibles ambientalmente amigables y sea autosuficiente para producir la nafta que la mayor producción de crudo pesado del país está demandando. Cuando concluya el proyecto, la Refinería estará en capacidad de procesar crudos pesados, con altos contenidos de azufre, ácidos y otros componentes. Esto obliga a la adopción de tecnología de punta y procesos altamente especializados que garanticen su conversión en productos valiosos como la gasolina y cumpliendo los más exigentes estándares de calidad. La producción de crudos cada vez más pesados en Colombia está haciendo necesaria la modernización y ampliación de la infraestructura de refinación de Ecopetrol. La misma razón está presente en el Plan Maestro de la Refinería de Cartagena (Reficar S.A.), otra empresa del Grupo Empresarial Ecopetrol. «El proyecto de modernización de la refinería de Barrancabermeja es una oportunidad valiosa para que se dé un salto cuántico respecto a la forma como venimos haciendo las cosas. Cuando uno piensa en grande y busca metas grandes logra resultados distintos. Con este proyecto buscamos ir en grande, pero no solo nosotros, sino también con la región en la que estamos, con Barrancabermeja, con el Magdalena Medio y con nuestro país», aseguran directivos de Ecopetrol en el puerto petrolero. Actualmente, la Refinería de Barrancabermeja tiene un factor de conversión del 76%, lo que ubica a esta instalación industrial en una clasificación de conversión media y orientada a procesar principalmente crudos livianos. Con la modernización pasará a un esquema de conversión profunda o alta conversión, con un factor del 96%. Al mismo tiempo, el proyecto busca ampliar la capacidad de carga de crudos pesados y una producción de combustibles más limpios, de mejor calidad y mayor rentabilidad. 90 años en un parpadeo. El 18 de febrero de 1922 llegaron al caserío La Tora, hoy Barrancabermeja, los primeros equipos procedentes del Perú de la International Petroleum Company para procesar una carga de 1.500 barriles diarios. En sus inicios la Refinería de Barrancabermeja entregaba cuatro productos. La historia de la refinería se ha construido a la par con la historia de Barrancabermeja. Para ese entonces el pueblo tenía 404 viviendas y 3 mil habitantes. Su primer alcalde, Juan Bautista Reyes, fue nombrado mediante decreto del gobernador de Santander de la época, José María García Hernández. Nació el Instituto Santander, el primer colegio privado en este poblado a orillas del Magdalena Medio que empezaba a ganar reconocimiento nacional por el campo La Cira Infantas. Justamente para procesar el crudo de La Cira fue creada la refinería de Barrancabermeja. Desde que Ecopetrol la recibió, un poco después de la reversión de la Concesión De Mares, cuando había asegurado la capacidad técnica y humana para manejarla, ha invertido poco a poco en la consolidación de sus procesos, la modernización de sus instalaciones y el mejoramiento de las competencias de sus trabajadores. Para cuando llegó a manos de la empresa, la capacidad de procesamiento de la refinería había pasado de esos 1.500 iniciales a 22 mil barriles diarios. En 1953 entraron en funcionamiento la unidad de destilación, la unidad de cracking modelo IV y la primera viscorreductora, y comenzó la ampliación de Servicios Industriales. La capacidad de carga de la refinería fue creciendo y sus instalaciones también lo hicieron. En 1.967 se puso en operación la segunda unidad de destilación, cracking orthoflow, la unidad de destilación al vacio y la planta de lubricantes. En 1972 la carga superó los 100 mil barriles diarios y empezaron a funcionar las plantas petroquímicas: Aromáticos, Parafinas, Polietileno I y Alquilos. En 1980 inició operación la Unidad de Balance (Cracking UOP I, Demex, Unibón) y las plantas Etileno II y Polietileno II. En 1995 se inauguró la nueva Cracking UOP II y se logró la modernización de la planta U-200. En 2000, con la Planta de Alquilación, empezó a producir gasolina de alto octanaje. En 2010, con la Pla nt a de Hidrot rat a miento de Combustibles (HDT), entró a operar la nueva planta de tratamiento de gases residuales (Unidad de clauspol), que redujo significativamente las emisiones de dióxido de azufre (SO2) a la atmósfera en el puerto petrolero. Esta planta recupera los gases residuales y los convierte en azufre para luego comercializarlo en el país. Así se evita su quema en los incineradores y las teas, para que Barrancabermeja y el país respiren un aire mejor. 10 nuevas plantas serán construidas en terrenos aledaños a los de la actual refinería. Ahora la Refinería de Barrancabermeja se prepara para asumir otro gran reto: el Plan de Modernización. El precio del diesel y su consecuente mayor demanda en Colombia, el incremento en la producción de crudos pesados y la disminución de los livianos, junto a regulaciones ambientales cada vez más exigentes para los combustibles, hacen que la refinería se vea en la necesidad de adecuar su esquema de producción mediante la modernización de sus procesos e infraestructura. El diesel que se distribuya en todo el país deberá tener menos de 50 partículas por millón de azufre y la gasolina contará con menos de 300 partes por millón. Actualmente el combustible con esa calidad se entrega en Bogotá, Medellín a los sistemas de transporte masivo de Colombia. Asegurar a largo plazo ese suministro de mejores combustibles al país, sin necesidad de costosas importaciones, es uno de los objetivos del proyecto. La modernización asegurará también autosuficiencia de nafta, producto esencial para el transporte de los crudos pesados por oleoducto, y garantizará el abastecimiento de la demanda proyectada de combustibles en la zona de influencia de la refinería más allá del 2020 y, dada la envergadura de la inversión, jalonará el desarrollo de las empresas nacionales de servicios del sector que cumplan los estándares exigidos por Ecopetrol para convertirse en aliados estratégicos futuros de la refinería. El proyecto ya superó las fases de prefactibilidad técnico / económica y de ingeniería conceptual, selección de tecnologías, ingeniería básica y plan de ejecución. La Junta Directiva de Ecopetrol sancionó el proyecto y aprobó su ejecución. Luego viene la ingeniería de detalle, las compras, la construcción, el montaje y la puesta en marcha de las nuevas unidades. Con la modernización se logrará el aprovechamiento del 96% del crudo que llega a la refinería. Para ello se instalarán plantas como la Unidad de Coquización Retardada, que mediante un proceso de eliminación de contaminantes a lo largo del proceso hará posible obtener 60 mil barriles adicionales de combustibles, prioritariamente diesel y gasolina. O la Hidrocraking, una planta con capacidad de 200 millones de pies cúbicos de hidrogeno, que será la encargada de la eliminación del azufre. La Planta de Amina, la Planta de Hidrodesulfurización y la Planta Despojadora de Aguas Agrias, también harán parte de la nueva configuración estructura. El complejo industrial de Barrancabermeja al cuadrado. En total serán 10 unidades nuevas, 6 tanques de almacenamiento de materia prima, una nueva subestación eléctrica interna con capacidad de 120 megavatios, el reemplazo y modificación o reubicación de 17 tanques existentes, nuevos sistemas de teas, enfriamiento de agua y almacenamiento de coque (el carbón térmico y el metalúrgico que quedan tras la refinación completa del crudo), entre otros. Pero lo anterior no es tan sencillo si descomponemos esos totales en sus actividades principales: habrá que mover 6 millones de metros cúbicos de tierra e instalar 1.508 equipos, algunos de los cuales tendrán más de 1.200 toneladas de peso. Serán necesarios 183 mil metros cúbicos de concreto, 23 mil pilotes, 37 mil toneladas de tubería, 28 mil toneladas de estructuras metálicas, 320 mil metros cuadrados de pintura y por lo menos 25 millones de horas / hombre para los trabajos de ingeniería y construcción. El Plan de Modernización consiste en sumar todo un complejo industrial al actual complejo industrial que es la Refinería de Barrancabermeja. A ese grupo de plantas siempre creciente y en mejora, que incluso en alguna de las estructuras anteriores de Ecopetrol en 60 años de historia se llamó precisamente así: el distrito Complejo Industrial de Barrancabermeja (CIB). Poner en marcha este proyecto requiere, además de disponer y poner en funcionamiento todas esas plantas antes mencionadas también interconectarlas adecuadamente con la refinería actual. En manos de Ecopetrol, la refinería no ha dejado de transformarse. La última planta instalada, la de hidrotratamiento, estuvo lista en diciembre de 2.010. Con la modernización, la Refinería de Barrancabermeja entraría al grupo de las mejores de Latinoamérica por la utilización de tecnología de punta, una operación confiable, segura y eficiente y, principalmente, por operar con un mínimo impacto ambiental. Sus instalaciones quedarán en capacidad de procesar más de 180 mil barriles diarios de crudos pesados, proveer hasta 50 mil barriles diarios de nafta (el diluyente requerido para el transporte de crudos pesados) y garantizar el abastecimiento de la demanda proyectada de combustibles en la zona de influencia de la refinería más allá del 2020. ¿Cómo se puede vincular Barrancabermeja con la Modernización de la Refinería? «El proyecto tiene clar

Las mejores jugadas de la madrugada NBA vienen cargadas de un recurso cada vez más usado en el baloncesto moderno. El bloqueo directo. Los 'highlights' de la jornada vienen marcados por las continuaciones de los pívots tras jugar un dos para dos. El más beneficiado de ello, DeAndre Jordan. El pívot de Los Ángeles Clippers se benefició de las asistencias del siempre solidario Chris Paul para aparecer por partida doble en el Top10. Los angelinos vencieron de forma clara en Washington.

Doughnut Drive-Thru – La Caverna lúdica 6 de Març de 2017 6 de Març de 2017 ~ Davidet Estamos en una panadería y debemos preparar los Donuts y otros dulces que nos van pidiendo los clientes. Aprender y recordar las recetas es primordial para preparar y servir los productos. Los clientes satisfechos nos premiarán con sus propinas. Es el 7º juego de "The Mike Line" publicado por Grail Games después de una campaña de mecenazgo en Kickstarter. Es una versión de un juego japonés publicado en 2015,"Let's Make Bread!! (Panpakapan)", cuya versión original era también una panadería, pero haciendo diferentes tipos de pan. En Doughnut Drive-Thru, los jugadores están trabajando para hornear y vender lo más rápidamente posible Donas (y otros dulces) a los clientes. El jugador que consiga más propinas al final de la partida será el ganador. 4 cartas de cocina. 4 cartas de panadero con ayuda al juego en el reverso. 24 cartas de receta. 8 Donuts de madera. Autor: Ikaga-ya. Ilustraciones: Heiko Günther. Editorial: Grail Games. Se colocan en el centro de la mesa las cartas de cocina (Aprender receta, preparar, servir y pausa para café). Dependiendo del número de jugadores utilizaremos la cara de la carta correspondiente para 2/3 jugadores o para 4 jugadores. Cada jugador recibe una carta de receta de valor 0$, las que no se usen se dejan fuera de la partida. También reciben a 2 jugadores 3 donuts de madera y a 3/4 jugadores 2 donuts de madera. Se barajan el resto de cartas de receta y se dejan boca abajo formando una pila junto a las cartas de cocina. El dado también se deja junto a las cartas de cocina. El último jugador que haya comido un donut será el jugador inicial. En su turno cada jugador puede realizar una de las 3 acciones posibles. El jugador puede poner 1 o 2 donuts en los platos de una carta de cocina, para realizar la acción de la carta. Las acciones de las cartas son las siguientes. Aprender una receta. Si ponemos 1 donut cogeremos 2 cartas y elegiremos una, la otra la descartaremos boca arriba formando una pila de descarte. Si ponemos 2 donuts cogeremos 3 cartas y elegiremos una, descartando igual las otras 2. La carta que elijamos la pondremos boca arriba en nuestra zona de juego. La carta de receta: Valor de la propina. Tirada mínima del dado para preparar la receta. Tirada mínima del dado para servir la receta. Preparar un receta. Colocando 1 donut en la carta tiramos el dado para poder preparar la receta. Si hemos puesto 2 donuts sumaremos +1 en nuestra tirada. Si conseguimos como mínimo el valor marcado en la carta, debemos girarla 90 grados hacia la derecha, quedándonos el valor de servir la receta a la izquierda de la carta. Servir una receta. Colocando 1 donut en la carta tiramos el dado para poder servir la receta. Si hemos puesto 2 donuts sumaremos +1 en nuestra tirada. Si conseguimos como mínimo el valor marcado en la carta, hemos servido la receta y volteamos la carta dejándola en vertical en nuestra zona de juego. Una vez servida una receta, podremos usar la carta para añadir un +1 a nuestra tirada girando la carta 90 grados a la derecha. Podremos utilizar y girar la cantidad de cartas que necesitemos de las disponibles en nuestra zona de juego. Pausa para café. Se puede colocar 1 solo donut por turno, para girar una carta de receta servida usada y poder volverla a usar para obtener un +1 en una tirada. ¡Importante! En cualquier tirada que nos salga un donut (valor 1 del dado), se considera tirada fallida y no se puede sumar ninguna bonificación, perdiendo entonces el turno. Coger donuts En su turno, un jugador también puede elegir recuperar hasta 2 donuts de una sola carta de cocina. Pero nunca podrá superar la cantidad máxima de donuts que haya tenido al principio de la partida. Pasar Si un jugador no quiere o no puede realizar una acción deberá pasar. Cuando un jugador sirve su 5 receta, la partida termina acabando el turno en juego el resto de jugadores. Se suman los valores de la propinas servidas y el jugador con más propinas será el ganador. En caso de empate el jugador que haya servido más tipos diferentes de recetas, letras marcadas en la parte inferior izquierda de las cartas de receta. Si continua el empate, los jugadores comparten la victoria. Variante cartas de panaderos Hay 4 cartas de panadero, cada una tiene una habilidad especial que podremos usar durante la partida.

Acciones de concienciación ambiental – AlmaNatura Acciones de concienciación ambiental 30/09/2014 Por Juanjo Manzano Debemos hacer una reflexión sobre lo que podemos aportar personalmente para evitar ser complices del gran desastre natural que se está produciendo sobre la tierra. Escrito por Sara Esteve; La ambición por conseguir dinero sin límites por parte del hombre ha conseguido acabar de forma irreversible con una gran parte de los recursos naturales existentes en nuestro planeta. La acción del hombre sobre la naturaleza y el Planeta, que a fin de cuentas es nuestra casa, está favoreciendo la aparición de numerosos problemas que van desde la extinción de numerosas especies hasta el cambio climático con las complicaciones que esto acarrea. Estamos hablando de un problema muy grave y que por culpa de esa avaricia, la destrucción de nuestro planeta avanza sin límites cada día que pasa. Son muchos los organismos u organizaciones medioambientales que llevan décadas avisándonos del este problema que nos acecha pero hasta hace apenas unos años la mayoría de los habitantes del planeta no les haciamos mucho caso. Para evitar toda una serie de problemas que tarde o temprano acaban afectandonos se tiene que llevar a cabo sobre la población mundial programas de concienciación sobre el medio ambiente. De esta manera evitaremos realizar tareas que a la larga acabaran perjudicandonos a nosotros y a todos los que nos rodean. Existen diferentes proyectos alrededor del mundo para llevar a cabo una concienciación medioambiental eficiente y de los cuáles podemos tomar como ejemplo para realizar proyectos similares en nuestros entornos, como por ejemplo el Proyecto ECOVIDA en la ciudad mexicana de Mexicali, que tiene como objetivo buscar planes de educación ambiental que desarrollen habitos y herramientas para la conservación del medioambiente en una comunidad. Dentro de las acciones que podemos realizar cada uno de nosotros para favorecer la conservación de nuestros entornos más cercanos encontramos las siguientes: Cada dia generamos miles de toneladas de residuos sobre toda la tierra. Especialmente las ciudades son lugares donde no son capaces de almacenar tantos residuos en sus vertederos. La transformación de los desechos que generamos en otros materiales supone un beneficio muy grande para nuestro medio ambiente ya que reduce los residuos del planeta así como los problemas medioambientales. Los materiales que se pueden reciclar son muchos, como la ropa, el papel y cartón desechable, el cristal o el plastico de envases…etc. Cada vez más se están incorporando en los diferentes municipios de España diferentes tipos de contenedores de residuos para ayudar en el reciclaje. Si utilizamos este tipo de recipientes estaremos favoreciendo la conservación del medio ambiente en nuestro entorno. Para ello sería conveniente tener en nuestra casa diferentes cubos de basura con diferentes espacios que nos permitiera cada vez que tiramos la basura introducir cada residuo en su espacio correspondiente. Este tipo de agricultura ecológica cada dia está tomando más pulso entre los agricultores ya que tiene muchos más beneficios que la huerta moderna e intensiva. El uso de este tipo de huerto permite favorecer la fertilidad de la tierra y a evitar el uso de peligrosos fertilizantes ya que este tipo de producción está destinada a un uso más saludable de la alimentación por parte del consumidor. Otro aspecto importante es que las semillas que se utilizan no han sido modificadas genéticamente y por lo tanto el resultado es la producción de alimentos muchos más sanos. Existen cooperativas de huertas ecológicas como la cooperativa BAH! de Galápagos en Guadalajara. Todos los productos ecológicos deben estar regulados por la normativa europea (Reglamento CE 2092/91) donde se establecen las normas de producción, de etiquetado así como del control que deben seguir estos productos desde su huerta hasta el consumidor. El conocimiento de la huerta ecológica está también presente en los estudios universitarios de los ingenieros agrónomos. Muchas universidades ya cuentan con sus propios huertos ecológicos donde los estudiantes pueden aprender a utilizar las herramientas más adecuadas, las semillas más favorables…etc. Es curioso pero en los últimos tiempos la creación de este tipo de huerta está siendo recomendada como terapía medicinal llamada " Terapía hortícola" y sus beneficios están siendo comprobados ya que generan entre los pacientes una mayor autoestima, genera motivación, concentración, etc. En España actualmente hay muchas personas que están compartiendo sus coches con los compañeros para ir al lugar del trabajo generalmente para ahorrar en combustible, pero ese no debería ser únicamente el objetivo de este tipo de uso. El principal objetivo que debería tenerse es el reducir las emisiones de CO2 ya que producen un alto grado de toxicidad sobre la atmósfera que nos rodea produciendo graves problemas de salud entre las personas e incluso entre la naturaleza. También existen diferentes empresas encargadas de organizar viajes a través del uso compartido del coche como por ejemplo la compañía blablacar la cuál pone en contacto a diferentes personas que tienen como objetivo viajar al mismo destino. Este tipo de actividad no sólo reduce costes del viaje sino que también ayuda a disminuir la contaminación mediambiental. Usar la bicicleta Ya hace años que en ciertos países como Holanda o Francia las personas utilizan sus bicicletas para transportarse de un lugar a otro ya sea al lugar de estudios, de empleo o incluso para realizar pequeñas compras por sus ciudades o pueblos. Esta actividad es muy beneficiosa no sólo para ahorrar en transporte, sino también para realizar ejercicio o para reducir las emisiones de CO2 que se llevarían a cabo si se utilizara el coche o incluso el transporte público. Existen municipios donde ya se están habilitando las infraestucturas necesarias para favorecer el transporte en bicicleta como son los carrile

Buenos días Capitán: Inflación y boquerones En Alemania, entre enero de 1922 y noviembre de 1923 la tasa de inflación acumulada ascendió a un billón por ciento. Para hacernos una idea del significado de esa cifra piénsese que el dinero suficiente para adquirir todas las viviendas del término municipal de Málaga no bastaría un par de años después para pagar una ración de boquerones.

Cómo podría ser el nuevo Los Andes que imagina Cavalieri :: Diario La Unión | Informando desde 1897 Cómo podría ser el nuevo Los Andes que imagina Cavalieri Se arma. Con seis refuerzos hasta el momento, Los Andes cuenta hoy con un plantel de 20 futbolistas y, de a poco, comienza a darle forma a un once titular. El nuevo plantel ya cuenta con 20 futbolistas. Con las recientes contrataciones de Rivas y Mbombaj, Los Andes suma seis contrataciones en el actual mercado de pases y, de a poco, el nuevo equipo del técnico Germán Cavalieri comienza a tomar forma. Hasta el momento, el Milrayitas incorporó cuatro defensores, dos laterales (Minervino y Vaca) y dos zagueros centrales (Cepeda y García), y ahora sumó dos mediocampistas más, uno creativo (Rivas) y otro por la izquierda (Mbombaj), para cumplir los huecos que tenía el plantel tras la salida de varios futbolistas el 30 de junio. Así, de esta manera, Los Andes ya tiene una base importante de lo que será el plantel para afrontar la definición de la tercera categoría. En total hay 20 futbolistas confirmados y aún se aguarda por una resolución favorable en relación a las continuidades de Turraca, Levato y Peppino. Por eso, en caso de que estas negociaciones se resuelvan de buena manera, sólo le quedaría contratar un delantero, un volante por derecha y posiblemente un arquero, de acuerdo a las pretensiones del cuerpo técnico. Por este motivo, y con la cantidad de jugadores ya tiene a disposición, Cavalieri puede empezar a imaginarse un equipo titular en la cabeza y con los posibles suplentes. Con 20 futbolistas, Los Andes tiene gran parte del plantel armado y aguarda por la resolución favorable por Turraca, Levato y Peppino para buscar los últimos refuerzos. En la línea defensiva, con los refuerzos y las continuidades aseguradas, es

Rayados: Los que nunca volvieron, parte 1 | Zona Rayada Expresión Rayada enero 30, 2013 comentarios Enrique Cavazos Antonio De Nigris, Guillermo Franco, Monterrey, Rayados Con la noticia de que Guillermo Franco se retiraba de las canchas, el trágico pensamiento de que jamás volvería a ver al ídolo con el que crecí gritando mis primeros cantos de gol con la camiseta albiazul inundaban mi mente. Sí, es cierto, aún siendo un pequeño ya tenía noción de las cosas con el Monterrey de Mohamed y compañía, así como también de Antonio De Nigris, del cual quiero hablar hoy, pero no fue hasta con la imagen de un delantero corriendo hacia la tribuna con su mano estirando la camiseta y gritando efusivamente "gol" cuando el amor por el fútbol lo encontré en su máximo esplendor. Enfocando el tema en dos hombres que se ganaron el cariño de la gente regiomontana, es como daré mi opinión sobre dos jugadores que mi deseo -y pienso que el de muchos otros- era verlos jugar, nuevamente, con la indumentaria rayada. Primero quiero hablar, en esta primera parte, de Antonio De Nigris, ser humano que de tan solo pronunciar su nombre la piel se eriza y con justa razón. El "Tano" fue una pieza clave en el ataque rayado a principios de década. Haciendo uso de su potente remate de cabeza, Toño cautivó a toda la hinchada rayada y con un gran corazón y amor al equipo, la afición albiazul lo tomó como un jóven ídolo. De Nigris emprendió una exótica aventura la cual contrajo consigo campeonatos en Colombia, participación sigilosa en México y goles al por mayor en Europa. Se habló en buena cantidad de ocasiones que el Ta

ITC-BT-52, el reglamento que normalizará las instalaciones de carga en edificios, acaba de ser aprobado en Consejo de Ministros y ya está publicada en el Boletín Oficial del Estado (BOE). De este modo, después de un tiempo de espera, al fin ya disponemos de la legislación necesaria para la instalación de puntos de recargar de vehículos eléctricos en aparcamientos colectivos públicos y privados y en la vía pública. En ella se fija la obligatoriedad de una preinstalación mínima en aparcamientos y estacionamientos colectivos privados, que permita a cada propietario conectarse sin "incurrir en costes más altos" que incluye dejar preparados los huecos y las canalizaciones necesarias.

El tribunal, encabezado por Lorenzetti, recibió el reclamo de 34 senadores En un fuerte gesto de diálogo institucional, que contrasta con la postura que el Gobierno mantiene con el Congreso, tres jueces de la Corte Suprema de Justicia recibieron ayer a 26 senadores nacionales de la oposición, que pidieron participar en las causas que varias provincias mantienen contra la Nación por la distribución de fondos de la coparticipación federal. Atento a la trascendencia del hecho y a no prejuzgar, lo que le podría valer una recusación, Lorenzetti destacó que ésta era "la primera vez en toda la historia que la Corte recibe a un grupo tan importante de senadores", lo cual aclaró "causa cierta conmoción". El presidentedel máximo tribunal de justicia de la Nación, agregó: "Esta es una reunión institucional, protocolar y muy positiva. Es un diálogo entre poderes que nunca se hizo".

Fedecámaras: Mesas de trabajo no son suficiente para hacer frente a la crisis - Noticiero Digital Fedecámaras: Mesas de trabajo no son suficiente para hacer frente a la crisis Mensaje por redaccion_lg » 10 May 2019, 19:23 ND / 10 may 2019 – Ricardo Cussano, primer vicepresidente de Fedecámaras, habló en torno a las mesas de trabajo que se comenzarán a implementar y entrarán en vigencia desde el próximo lunes en el país. "Porque no hicieron caso cuando el país estaba menos deteriorado, cuando esta medida podía haber tenido éxito. Hoy es como colocarle un champú anticaspa a un calvo, no hay estructura, hoy tienes a una banca minimizada en su capacidad crediticia, entre otras cosas porque la economía venezolana se minimizó, y porque la banca se nutre de la clientela, y la clientela cada vez tiene menos bolívares, porque en título personal gana menos, o porque en personas jurídicas producen menos", expresó Cussano en una entrevista al programa En vivo de Unión Radio. Para Cussano es clave que haya una independencia del banco central en torno al tema, "La realidad es que es una medida totalmente insuficiente que no está inserta en políticas fiscales, monetarias y cambiarías que. por cierto, deberían ser dictadas por la independencia de un banco central que hoy se limita simplemente a darle a un botón para imprimir masa monetaria que, por demás, va es a suplir el déficit fiscal del gasto del sector público". Asimismo aseveró que el principal problema del país es estructural, ya que "se sufre el problema de infraestructura vial, en aeropuertos, crisis severa de luz eléctrica en el interior del país, disminuciones del talento humano, falta de financiamiento y falta del poder adquisitivo del salario, en definitiva se sufre el modelo de socialismo del siglo 21". "Yo creo que hoy, quienes tienen el poder desde el ejecutivo nacional, no tienen capacidad para remendar el daño que han hecho en la economía, lo que no significa que no puedan formar parte de un proceso de modelo distinto, aunque hoy los mercados financieros a los cuales necesitas accesar no dan credibilidad y es bastante complejo que se solven

Aviación Comercial Mundial Swiss introducirá a partir de mayo alimentos y bebidas sin gluten ni lactosa para alérgicos Swiss International Air Lines introducirá a partir del próximo mes de mayo una serie de productos que están diseñados específicamente para mejorar el vuelo de las personas alérgicas. Estas innovaciones consisten en alimentos y bebidas sin gluten y lactosa, junto con otros cambios en el interior de la cabina. Swiss se ha asociado con el Centro Europeo de Investigación de la Alergia (ECARF) para ofrecer a sus clientes productos más personalizado, que están orientados a los viajeros con alergias. De forma que los alérgicos podrán tomar crema de café libre de lactosa, además de la popular barrita de chocolate, también libre de lactosa. Dependiendo de la duración del vuelo, los pasajeros con alergias o intolerancias pueden solicitar mediante pago bocadillos especiales, yogur o pasteles sin lactosa o gluten. Asimismo, los pasajeros de vuelos de larga distancia y los de la clase de negocios dentro de Europa podrán solicitar con 24 horas de antelación al vuelo que se les sirvan comidas especiales adaptadas a sus necesidades. Por otra parte, Swiss está realizando modificaciones en los asientos de clase First y Business para que los pasajeros dispongan de almohadas rellenas con materiales sintéticos como alternativa a la versión de plumón. Swiss también está eliminando de la cabina el uso de flores decorativas y ambientadores que pueden causar irritaciones de nariz y garganta. Por último, en los lavabos introducirá jabones que son particularmente suaves en la piel . «El número de personas que sufren de alergias han aumentado en todo el mundo industrializado en los últimos años», comentó el profesor Torsten Zuberbier, director de la ECARF, que tiene su sede en Berlín. «Más del 30% de la población de Europa padece una o más alergias, por no hablar de los afectados indirectamente, como sus familias. Sin embargo, sólo alrededor de un 10% de los pacientes recibe el tratamiento médico adecuado y las alergias con frecuencia no se toman en serio, incluso por los propios enfermos». 23/04/2014, 09:33 Delta Air Lines ha completado la instalación de los asientos cama completamente planos con acceso directo al pasillo en BusinessElite en toda su flota de fuselaje ancho internacional, convirtiéndose en la única compañía aérea de los EE.UU. en ofrecer este tipo de asientos y la conveniencia del acceso directo desde el pasillo en todos los vuelos transoceánicos. -el lanzamiento del servicio internacional de Wi-Fi y completó la instalación de Wi-Fi en todos los vuelos domésticos de doble clase y en los jets regionales, ofreciendo este servicio a más de 400.000 clientes por día, por encima de los 10.000 pies en más de 870 aviones. -la transformación de la experiencia de dormir en el aire al ofrecer ropa de cama Westin Heavenly In-Flight para clientes en la cabina BusinessElite. -la actualización del kit de amenidades para BusinessElite con elegantes estuches de Tumi y la marca de productos para el cuidado de la piel Malin + Goetz. -la conformación de un equipo de chefs celebrados y reconocidos con el Premio James Beard para ofrecer a los clientes excelentes comidas y vinos seleccionados a 30.000 pies de altura. -la introducción de un kit para dormir en clase Turista internacional y el agregado de amenidades para los clientes de clase Turista en vuelos transoceánicos y a Sudamérica. Delta ha invertido miles de millones de dólares en la experiencia del cliente, incluyendo la actualización de los interiores con más espacio para equipaje y acceso a fuente para recarga eléctrica a lo largo de 225 aviones de fuselaje angosto hasta el año 2016, una nueva Terminal 4 en el JFK de New York y la terminal internacional Maynard H. Jackson Jr. en Atlanta. Delta también ha gastado más de $ 100 millones para ampliar, renovar y consolidar las Terminales C y D en el aeropuerto de LaGuardia de Nueva York, abrió sus Sky Deck en los Delta Sky Clubs de JFK-Nueva York y Atlanta en el 2013. Además, los clientes han visto la inversión de Delta en sus más de 50 Delta Sky Clubs en todo el sistema, las fuentes para recarga eléctrica en decenas de aeropuertos, las continuas actualizaciones de la aplicación Fly Delta, incluyendo características tales como seguimiento de equipaje y registro desde el dispositivo móvil.

De los 58,1 millones de empleos que garantiza el sector, 8,7 millones están dentro de la propia industria: empleos en aerolíneas, en aeropuertos y en la industria aeronáutica. Los proveedores de esas compañías garantizan otros diez millones de puestos de trabajo en servicios como el catering, el suministro de combustible, finanzas y componentes para la aeronáutica. El informe estima que los salarios de estos empleos directos e indirectos generan una cifra de alrededor de 4,6 millones de empleos en la economía general. Los autores del reporte de ATAG señalan que, con base en las actuales tasas de crecimiento y las tendencias de la industria, esta garantizará 103 millones de empleos y aportará 5,8 billones de dólares dentro de 20 años. Ello dependerá, según explicó Gill, de cuánto apoyo recibe el sector. "El transporte aéreo está creciendo rápidamente, particularmente en Asia-Pacífico, América Latina y Oriente Medio, en economías en expansión y con clases medias emergentes que sacan provecho de los beneficios de los viajes aéreos. Sin embargo, a nivel global, el análisis indica que incluso un crecimiento de la aviación a una tasa 1% menor podría reducir en 12,4 millones el conteo de empleos previstos para 2032". "El crecimiento debe ser concebido de una forma más holística, combinando los factores económicos, sociales y ambientales. Por ejemplo, la buena planificación de infraestructuras puede hacer la diferencia 20 años después. La asociación entre los sectores público y privado es clave si las economías de 2030 desean explotar al máximo los beneficios de la aviación", concluyó. http://www.caribbeannewsdigital.com/...ento-economico 08/05/2014, 10:23 Etihad se inventa una nueva primera clase en sus A380 La aerolínea de Emiratos Árabes Etihad ha dado el do de pecho en la configuración interior de su nuevo A380, que recibirá a finales de este año. La compañía se inventa una primera superior, a la que ha llamado Residence, y que incluye incluso un baño privado en cada una de las suites que componen esta cabina. Una experiencia similar a la de volar en un avión privado, con la diferencia de que te acompañan casi 500 personas. Cómo no podía ser de otra manera, ha sido una aerolínea de Oriente Medio, Etihad, la que ha dado un salto cualitativo en lo que todos conocemos, aunque sea de oídas, por una primera clase. La aerolínea de Emiratos se inventa una primera superior, a la que ha bautizado como Residence, que pretende transmitir la experiencia de un vuelo en jet privado, con la única salvedad de que en el mismo avión viajan otras 498 personas, eso sí, en categorías distintas. Todo indica que la aerolínea ha hecho un auténtico esfuerzo para diferenciarse en el servicio de un avión, que aunque sigue siendo un referente en el transporte aéreo, ya lleva siete años operando con las aerolíneas más punteras del mundo. Así, donde se ha dado el do de pecho es con esta cuarta clase, que casi podemos decir que es un avión privado a bordo del A380. Se trata de una única cabina, que pude ser ocupada por uno o dos viajeros, con 11,6 metros cuadrados, y que cuenta con tres habitaciones: los asientos "normales", un cuarto de baño privado con ducha (sesiones de 4 minutos de agua); y un dormitorio. Los dos asientos, un sofá para la aerolínea, tienen 1,53 metros de ancho. El monitor de televisión es de 32 pulgadas. Los otros servicios son similares a los de primera clase: otomán con cajones para objetos personales, nevera, puertas… El dormitorio, situado en la parte delantera de la cabina, separado de los asientos por el baño, cuenta con una cama doble de 2,08 metros de largo y 1,20 m de ancho, con espacio de almacenamiento debajo de esta, mesa auxiliar, distintos tipos de luces auxiliares; un monitor de TV de 27 pulgadas y armario. Se incluye un servicio personal de mayordomo, posibilidad de menús a la carta y traslados a y desde el aeropuerto en limusina. Todo ello, eso sí, a un precio: 15.200 euros para un vuelo Abu Dhabi-Londres (sólo ida), que es la primera ruta en la que el A380 de Etihad operará desde diciembre de 2014. Además de ese primer ejemplar, Etihad recibirá otros cuatro A380 en 2015, tres en 2016 y dos en 2017. El segundo ejemplar reforzará los vuelos a Londres, que será finalmente el primer destino del avión desde Abu Dhabi. A lo largo de 2015, según lleguen los aviones previstos para ese año Sydney y Nueva York también serán servidas con el A380. BOEING 787 TAMBIÉN A FINAL DE AÑO Otro de los nuevos aviones que incorporará la aerolínea a lo largo de este año será els Boeing 787. El primero de ellos entrará en servicio en diciembre de 2014 entre Abu Dhabi y Dusseldorf, seguido de Washington y Mumbai en enero de 2015. Son 71 los B-787 pedidos por Etihad -41 B-787-9 y 30 B-787-10-, de los que dos llegarán antes de que finalice 2014, 3 en 2015, tres en 2016 y nueve en 2017. El resto legarán hasta el año 2023. La configuración interna a la que hemos hecho referencia en el texto por ahora sólo ha sido confirmada por la aerolínea para las cinco primeras unidades que recibirá. 09/05/2014, 08:04 Air France también apuesta por una primera superior Air France ha presentado su nueva cabina de primera clase, una auténtica suit privada, que la aerolínea empezará a equipar en sus 19 Boeing 777 a partir de septiembre de 2014. Así, la aerolínea francesa intenta dar la batalla a la exclusiva oferta de las aerolíneas asiáticas y de Oriente Medio. La nueva cabina de primera de Air France pone a disposición de sus más exclusivos clientes una suit de 3 m2 Parecía que la oferta en la primera clase de las principales aerolíneas europeas no daba más de sí. Grandes espacios, oferta gastronómica de lujo, productos beauty de alta gama…Todo parecía estar inventado. Pues no es así, ese lujo que es el espacio en un avión comienza a redefinirse en las primeras clases, y ahora es Air France la aerolínea que ha presentado su nueva cabina de primera, La Premiére, como la llama la compañía francesa, que se compone de cuatro suites individuales, que permite el aislamiento total del pasajero, si así lo desea, de 3 m2 cada una de ellas. Entre el equipamiento de estas cuatro suites que empezará a incorporar la aerolínea en su flota de Boeing 777-300 a partir de septiembre de 2014, se encuentra una pantalla táctil de 24 pulgadas, con imagen de alta definición. Pero sin duda el elemento estrella es la cama. Con 77 centímetros de anchura y 2,01 m de largo, completamente plana, cuando el pasajero desea dormir los tripulantes de cabina instalan un colchón sobre el asiento, una almohada con funda de hilo de algodón y un ededrón Sofitel my bed. La privacidad de cada una de estas suites está garantizada, informan desde la compañía, gracias a unas gruesas cortinas, qeu se sujetan por alzapaños de cuero, que si se cierran dan una sensación de total intimidad. La suite puede acoger a dos personas, ya que frente al asiento principal se ha colocado un banco para el invitado. El asiento de la nueva primera se convierte en una cama de 2,01 m de largo Como no podía ser de otra forma, todo ello envuelto en tejidos de primera calidad, madera, cuero, toques metálicos, guardarropa individual, persianas eléctricas con sistema de apertura y cierre accionable con una ligera presión del dedo, acceso directo al pasillo central y, un gastronomía al más alto nivel, con diseño personalizado de los menús pensados por los más famosos restauradores del país galo con estrellas Michelin. La presentación de la nueva cabina de la flota de largo radio ha comenzado el 8 de mayo en Shangái, mediante un shorw room que la compañía ha bautizado como "Air France, FRance is in the air" que pasará también por Nueva York del 26 al 28 de junio, para aterrizar en París del 20 al 21 de septiembre, cuando esta nueva primera clase ya haya empezado a ser instalada en los Boeing 777. 11/05/2014, 11:30 Bolivia: Ministro afirma que TAM será una empresa estatal Con la promulgación del decreto reglamentario de la Ley de Empresas Públicas, Transporte Aéreo Militar (TAM) se convertirá en empresa estatal y será controlada por la Dirección General de Aeronaútica Civil (DGAC), anunció ayer el ministro de Obras Públicas, Vladimir Sánchez. "El TAM va a entrar paulatinamente a un proceso de ser una institución que va estar controlada por el Estado, en la medida que salga el reglamento de la Ley de Empresas Publicas. El TAM se va a transformar en una empresa estatal y va a ser controlada y supervisada por la Dirección General de Aeronáutica Civil (DGAC)", dijo. Entre junio y julio de este año, el TAM empezaría a operar como una empresa aérea puesto que actualmente se realizan los estudios para determinar su estructura, organización y normas que darán paso a la compañía, informó el pasado 2 de febrero el viceministro de Transportes, Raúl Vizcarra. En la actualidad el TAM no está regulado por la DGAC. De acuerdo con el artículo 5 de la Ley de Empresas Estatales 466, la empresa pública tendrá carácter estratégico cuando desarrolle su actividad económica en los sectores de hidrocarburos, energía, telecomunicaciones, transporte y otros de interés estratégico para el país, "que sean identificados por el Consejo Superior Estratégico de la Empresas Públicas (Coseep) en el marco de la Constitución Política del Estado". Estas empresas tendrán la finalidad de producir excedentes económicos para potenciar el desarrollo económico productivo "y financiar la atención de políticas sociales del país". En la página web de la Autoridad de Control y Fiscalización de Telecomunicaciones y Transportes (ATT) se difundió el año pasado un comunicado emitido por la Asociación de Líneas Aéreas (ALA-Bolivia), que señala que el 24 de abril de 2013 el Ministerio de Obras Públicas, la ATT y la Fuerza Aérea Boliviana (FAB) acordaron que el TAM ingrese de forma paulatina al sistema de fiscalización, control y regulación aeronáutica en el plazo máximo de un año. Ministro afirma que TAM ser una empresa estatal 11/05/2014, 11:37 La aerolínea EasyJet utilizará drones en sus inspecciones La aerolínea de bajo coste easyJet utilizará drones a partir de 2015 para realizar las inspecciones externas de sus aviones en menos tiempo y "potencialmente con más detalle", anunció hoy en un comunicado. "La tecnología de los drones puede ser extremadamente efectiva para nosotros de cara a mejorar la supervisión de los aviones, chequeos que normalmente se dilatan más de un día podrían realizarse en un par de horas y potencialmente con más detalle", explicó el jefe de Ingeniería de la compañía, Ian Davies. Los drones, que están en fase de desarrollo, estarán programados para escanear y evaluar la flota de easyJet y para enviar un informe a los ingenieros sobre cualquier fallo, lo que "agilizará" la solución de incidencias y "disminuirá los retrasos en los vuelos" por fallos técnicos, según la aerolínea. Esos aviones no tripulados se usarán en la inspección de 220 aeronaves de los modelos Airbus A319 y A320. Para poder implementar los drones, easyJet tiene que modificar la tecnología existente, para lo q

Tras pacto, EU envía a México ocho mil migrantes - Ciudadanos por México El titular de la Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores (SRE), Marcelo Ebrard, aseguró que tras la negociación con Estados Unidos (EU) mediante la que se evitó la aplicación de aranceles a los productos mexicanos, el Gobierno federal ratificó el envío de la Guardia Nacional a la frontera Sur para contener el éxodo ilegal y adelantó que se recibirá a ocho mil migrantes procedentes de la Unión Americana mientras se define su situación legal en esa nación. "México no ganó todo, pero sí se logró que no haya imposición de aranceles a los productos mexicanos y se salió con la dignidad intacta", dijo Ebrard en Tijuana, durante el Acto de Unidad en Defensa de la Dignidad de México y en Favor de la Amistad con el Pueblo de los Estados Unidos. Ebrard reiteró que en esa negociación se acordó que además de que no habrá gravámenes, México se comprometió a que todas las personas que lleguen a suelo mexicano serán registradas y tendrán un proceso regular. "No levanto un puño cerrado, sino una mano abierta y franca. Reiteramos la disposición a la amistad, el diálogo y la colaboración", Andrés Manuel López Obrador sobre Donald Trump Aunque las autoridades mexicanas no confirman abiertamente hablar del concepto de tercer país seguro, los comentarios del titular de Exteriores dan ese sentido al convenio alcanzado en Washington: los indocumentados, de Centroamérica, por ejemplo, que soliciten asilo a la Unión Americana serán devueltos a México donde permanecerán mientras se resuelve su trámite. Añadió que, a petición del Presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador, por los principios y convicciones de fraternidad de México, mientras los extranjeros estén en el territorio "vamos a ser solidarios con ellos y vamos a proteger sus derechos humanos". "No levanto un puño cerrado, sino una mano abierta y franca. Reiteramos la disposición a la amistad, el diálogo y la colaboración", dijo López Obrador durante el acto en Tijuana que se desarrolló con un tono más conciliador del esperado y arropado miembros del Ejecutivo, gobernadores y representantes del Congreso. El Mandatario también avisó a su homólogo estadounidense, Donald Trump: "Los compromisos se cumplen", en referencia a lo pactado; México se comprometió a enviar a la frontera Sur a seis mil elementos de la Guardia Nacional, el cuerpo de seguridad creado inicialmente para reducir la violencia en el país. Trump agradeció a su par mexicano los esfuerzos de su Gobierno para lograr un acuerdo migratorio e impedir la imposición de aranceles, y urgió a la ratificación en su país del tratado comercial con México y Canadá (T-MEC). LEER TAMBIÉN: López Obrador dice que extiende la «mano abierta» a Trump Acuerdo viola los derechos: Nancy Pelosi La dirigente de la Cámara Baja afirma que el acuerdo es inconveniente para los inmigrantes. EFE El acuerdo migratorio de la Casa Blanca con México viola los derechos de los solicitantes de asilo, aseguró la lideresa demócrata de la Cámara de Representantes, Nancy Pelosi, quien criticó al presidente Donald Trump por su política de negociar con "amenazas y rabietas". El acuerdo de administración de Trump con México viola los derechos de los solicitantes de asilo bajo la ley federal estadounidense "y no aborda las causas fundamentales de la migración centroamericana", apuntó Pelosi en una declaración citada por medios estadounidenses. La presidenta de la Cámara de Representantes criticó asimismo las tácticas de negociación usadas por Trump con México, que describió como "una amenaza imprudente para imponer tarifas a nuestro amigo cercano y vecino del Sur". "Las amenazas y las rabietas no son una forma de negociar la política exterior", apuntó Pelosi, quien aseguró que con ello, Trump "h

El Senado provincial aprobó un sistema para la atención integral de personas con Alzheimer - Lu24 Actualizado: 19 Ene, 2021 8:38 pm El Senado provincial aprobó un sistema para la atención integral de personas con Alzheimer 7 diciembre, 2016 Leido: 21 La Cámara de Senadores Bonaerense aprobó un proyecto que crea el "Sistema Provincial de Atención Integral para las personas que viven con la enfermedad de Alzheimer u otras demencias", a través del cual el Estado deberá garantizar el tratamiento para las personas diagnosticadas y la contención del grupo familiar. La iniciativa presentada por el senador Federico Susbielles (FPV) fue girada el jueves pasado a la Cámara de Diputados para su posterior tratamiento. "La falta de dispositivos que atiendan integralmente a ésta enfermedad, deja a la persona que sufre Alzheimer y a su grupo familiar en situación de total desamparo. Estudios científicos demuestran que después de los 85 años de edad se acerca al 50% el índice de prevalencia, eso significa que una de cada dos personas que supere esa edad podría sufrir alguna enfermedad neurodegenerativa y por eso es imprescindible dar este paso tan importante en nuestro sistema de salud", señaló Susbielles. La propuesta obliga a la Provincia a garantizar el tratamiento socio-sanitario integral para las personas diagnosticadas que lo requieran, debiendo ser suministrada atención farmacológica, desarrollo de terapias integrales psicosociales y recreativas, contención del grupo familiar y acceso próximo, igualitario e irrestricto a Centros de Día, Residencias de Larga Estadía -antes llamados geriátricos- o Cuidadores Domiciliarios. Si la iniciativa se convierte en ley, se deberá incorporar la Cobertura Médico-Asistencial integral a las prestaciones de IOMA, de la

Sobre el rio negro. - SkyscraperCity Sobre el rio negro. The Bridge! por Giraldo., en Flickr Excelente, muy bueno, un 10. Buena composici�n el procesado no es de mi agrado pero bien logrado. 9/10 September 15th, 2012, 09:44 PM �Qu� bueno que est�s de vuelta, Giraldo! Al igual que Pty, el procesado, especialmente el contraste, no me agrada del todo. Quiz� porque las partes oscuras salen demasiado oscuras. Eso le vino bien a la estructura met�lica del puente, pero no tan bien a los pilares y la vegetaci�n. Por otra parte, y esto es pura preferencia personal, el color me hubiera gustado menos intenso, menos v�vido. Y es que llega a competir con las formas por la atenci�n del ojo. El colo no mucho me gusto, lo demas muy bueno. Muy interesante, Vagamundo.

Cristina anuncio nuevos creditos hipotecarios y remarco crecimiento economico | VivoBaires La jefa de Estado señaló que "una importante cadena de supermercados" le informó que después de "disminuir muy fuerte los gastos de publicidad" consiguió no sólo un aumento en sus ventas sino también "un aumento significativo en el margen de rentabilidad". Cristina llamó a empresarios y trabajadores a "realizar un gran esfuerzo", y resaltó que "hemos tenido olíticas de cuidar mucho la producción nacional, potenciando la industrialización del país, y esto se debe al mercado interno, al desendeudamiento". "Lo más importante para un dirigente sindical es garantizarle a su representado que va a seguir teniendo trabajo", agregó. "Que no se froten las manos los importadores. Vamos a hacer un sistema en el cual no se queden ellos con la diferencia" y para que los productos "lleguen a la gente", aclaró la Presidenta. Además, repasó la mejora de los índices de la Argentina en materia de reducción de la pobreza y crecimiento económico, entre otros, y realizó "un llamado a todos los argentinos para cuidar esto que estamos haciendo" Destacó el crecimiento de la actividad económica en el país, pese al contexto de la crisis financiera internacional, y señaló que el aumento pasó del "1,9 a fines del año pasado a 3,2 en e

De los 57 trabajadores que han perdido la vida en los primeros seis meses del año, 38 han muerto debido a un accidente ocurrido durante su jornada laboral (un 31% más que el año anterior) y 19 han fallecido al ir o volver del trabajo (

El día que llegó a Calamar – La Cola de Rata · 17/03/2019 ·7 Minuto de lectura·62 views La violencia, esa que por más de medio siglo ronda calles y montañas, se ha convertido en algo tan común que terminamos por acostumbrarnos a sus consecuencias. Texto / Jhonattan Arredondo – Fotografías / Andrés Felipe Mosquera Lo primero que hizo apenas llegando al municipio de Calamar, Guaviare, fue buscar un balsero. Lo encontró organizando algunas canecas con gasolina en la orilla del río Unilla. Había más de cinco hombres sentados junto a sus pequeñas embarcaciones, pero, por precaución, eligió preguntarle a uno solo: un negro alto y fornido que tenía tatuado en la espalda el rostro de una mujer y que, por suerte, se hallaba a un par de metros del grupo. De modo que le preguntó si lo podía llevar al lugar donde se encontraban sus hermanos, pero antes que pronunciara el nombre de la vereda donde debían ir, el balsero respondió con otra pregunta: "¿Tiene el permiso?". Mi padre, quien no sabía nada de dicho permiso, recuerda que en ese instante se preguntó desde cuándo las personas que vivían en su país tenían que solicitar un permiso para transitar de un lugar a otro. Para entonces, ya había escuchado en la radio algunas noticias sobre el conflicto armado en la zona, sin embargo, fue hasta el lugar de los hechos donde vino a estrellarse con este tipo de exigencias. Sin otra salida, mi padre se dirigió al pequeño aeropuerto municipal con una tristeza que ja

Vea nuestro noticiero "Desde Cuba" de CubadebateTV | Cubadebate En este artículo: Cuba, Cubadebate, CubadebateTV, Fidel en Vietnam, Internet, Medios de Comunicación, Páginas Web, Reforma Constitucional en Cuba, Televisión Detalles del proceso de debate popular sobre el Proyecto de Constitución, el 45 aniversario de la primera visita de Fidel a Vietnam, el evento sobre los nuevos desafíos de la economía latinoamericana que tuvo lugar en el Palacio de las Convenciones, así como tópicos del acontecer cultural y deportivo en Cuba durante la última semana son los temas centrales de la primera emisión del noticiero de Cubadebate en el mes de septiembre, "Desde Cuba". me lo perdí pues ni tengo facebook ni youtube, imagino la mitad de Cuba ni se entere de esto pues no tenemos acceso Yo pienso que ni el 10% de la población de Cuba tenga acceso a ver este noticiero por internet, pero bueno, al menos los de otros paises pueden verlo 17 septiembre 2018 a las 15:13 Este noticiero poco a poco nuestros estudiantes de las escuelas conectadas lo podran ver al menos en lka hora del almuerzo y en actividades complementarias imagen hacia el exterior!!!?? Como no tengo Youtube, voy a decir lo que pienso a traves de este medio es bueno que el pueblo participe y opine sobre la constitucion porque quien mejor que el pueblo para hacer valer esta constitucion. Por supuesto que no podemos verlo, no se para quien será 18 septiembre 2018 a las 8:13 ¿?¿?¿?será ta

Las 10 entidades federativas con mayor incidencia con el Estado de México con 785 muertes por accidentes de tránsito, le sigue Jalisco con 524, Michoacán 491, Veracruz donde este martes se registró un fatal accidente cuando un autobús literalmente aplastó dos autos con un saldo fatal de dos víctimas, hasta el mes de julio se habían contabilizaron 404 casos. Le sigue Sinaloa con 392, Guanajuato 385, Ciudad de México 362, Nuevo León 322, en el noveno lugar con 309 el estado de Oaxaca, mientras que en el décimo lugar se ubica Chiapas con 292. En contra parte, de acuerdo a los datos del Secretariado Ejecutivo del Sistema Nacional de Seguridad Pública (SESNSP), los estados que presentan menores números Tlaxcala con 20 Baja California Sur 35, Campeche 45, Aguascalientes con 79, Nayarit 80, Colima 94, Yucatán 98, Coahuila 118, Quintana Roo 127 y Durango 138.

Sobre la clonacion puedo pensar que un ser clonado es como que no es de nadie y ahi me va la frase de que es un desalmado, creo que Parra dice que es un desdichado vivo-muerto porque carecera de alma. Pero porque sera negado ese cuerpo en el mundo espiritual? pienso en algunas razones...como que no expresa originalidad no es unico e irrepetible entonces ese ser en el mundo espiritual no seria unico y eso no es posible, no es posible copiar a Dios!.

El sitio de mi recreo: junio 2016 Publicado por Juan en 22:19:00 El país que nunca encontrarás en un Atlas Publicado por Juan en 23:40:00 Hace tres años redescubrí los comics. Un buen amigo me puso sobre la pista de los fabulosos nuevos mundos de creación que la novela gráfica contemporánea está explorando y, como soy compulsivo, en cuanto comencé a nadar en ese mar terminé sumergido hasta el fondo. Ahora una cuidada colección de tebeos franceses, anglosajones, españoles o incluso indios y coreanos, ocupa cuatro baldas de mi librería. La selección incluye casi todos los clásicos del canon (Watchmen, Mouse, El Inkal, Persepolis…), las joyas del underground gringo (Burns, Clowes, los Hernández…), el cómic-reportaje actual (Sacco, Delisle, Davodeau…), lo mejor de las aventuras seriadas francófonas (Cosey, Bilal, Marini), las autobiografías intimistas que tanto se prodigan hoy en el mundo de la historieta (David B, Truong, Gallardo, Thompson) y hasta los metacómics y otras experimentaciones de autores como McClaud, McGuire o Sousanis. Manga, en cambio, he leído poco. Conozco Japón y me fascina su cultura, pero un prurito de prejuicio y pánico a transformarme definitivamente en un friki me mantienen distante del mundo del noveno arte nipón. Pero como me las quiero dar de marisabidillo comiquero, no he tenido más remedio que incursionar un poco en el subgénero. Eso sí, lo he hecho con cuidado, tímidamente, y sólo dispuesto a catar obras consagradas. Aquí dejo pues tres recomendaciones de obras clásicas del manga, atípicas las tres. Tebeos, sí, pero de una densidad creativa apabullante. Pies Descalzos, de Keui Nakazawa, viene a ser al manga lo que Mouse es al tebeo occidental: Como la obra de Spiegelman, narra en viñetas una tragedia histórica de dimensiones apocalípticas. Pies Descalzos nos cuenta, en primera persona, la detonación nuclear de Hiroshima y la vida de los supervivientes en los días subsiguientes a la debacle. Nakazawa, que vivió de niño en carne propia todo lo que describe, nos regala un relato sin muchos epítetos ni exageraciones (en todo caso, es difícil exagerar un horror mayor que el que realmente sucedió). Todo está contado con imágenes infantiloides y una narrativa sencilla que provocan un aterrador efecto de contraste entre la inocencia infantil y el horror sin límites. Es, simplemente, un libro imprescindible, cuya lectura debería ser obligatoria en todas las escuelas del mundo, si es que de verdad estamos interesados en crear sociedades pacíficas. Es imposible no oponerse a las armas nucleares después de haber leído Pies Descalzos. Uno nunca vuelve a ver el tema con los mismos ojos. Es un cómic que transforma algo dentro de ti. Pesadillas, de Katsuhiro Otomo, es una obra muy diferente. Para empezar, se trata de pura y dura ficción, o, para ser más específicos, de una novela negra. Ambientada en una arquitectura de geometrías claustrofóbicas, este manga, maravillosamente ilustrado, combina el hiperrealismo descriptivo del Japón urbano contemporáneo con un guion fantasioso e inquietante propio, efectivamente, de la más junguiana de las pesadillas simbólicas. El hombre que camina es el contrapeso perfecto a la anterior. Su autor, Jiro Tanigchi, logra reducir el cómic a un sencillo (y a la vez profundísimo), ejercicio zen: Un tipo camina por un barrio periférico en Japón, en la frontera entre la ciudad y el campo. En cada paseo afronta historias nimias, tales como encuentros con perros y gatos, observaciones del cielo nocturno, baños furtivos en una piscina pública al caer la tarde… intrahistorias cuya profundidad radica, precisamente, en su liviandad. El gran secreto escondido en Un Hombre que camina se llama observación, ese arte complejísimo que los cómics nos enseñan a cultivar. Cada cual de estas novelas gráficas arroja luz sobre un aspecto especifico de ese mirar al mundo tan único del Japón: narrativa realista en la linde entre la infancia y el peso de la historia en el caso de Pies descalzos; inquietantes mundos interiores de anónimos urbanitas en Pesadillas y evocación del misterio y la estética de lo sencillo en El hombre que camina. Si queréis retozar un poco en ese otro mundo cultural que es el País del Sol Naciente y echaros a las alforjas una buena dosis de sapiencia y placer intelectual, no dejéis de leerlos. Publicado por Juan en 11:38:00 Etiquetas: arte, comic, Japón, manga, tebeo Cada vitriólica diatriba de El País contra Podemos, cada griterío desaforado de Felipe González, Cebrián o Aznar (que tanto montan) demonizando a la alianza de izquierdas, en lugar de desinflarla (como supuestamente pretenden) sirven para engordarla. En lugar de tratar el fenómeno Podemos con naturalidad política e intentar acotarlo (si es ese su objetivo) con la fuerza de la razón, la lógica del debate y el realismo de la palabra, prefieren arrojarlo a los infiernos y calumniarlo con sandeces. Y es que, el asunto de fondo es que eso que antes cursimente se llamaba el Establishment y otros, yendo más al grano, llaman IBEX, aun no quiere despertar del sueño y asumir de una vez por todas que una porción sustancial del electorado español se siente hasta las mismísimas de la clase política, y abandonada a la deriva de un estado del Bienestar que nunca llegó a ser tal. El problema no se llama Pablo Iglesias, ni Podemos, ni Colau, ni Zapata. El problema se llama intereses creados, pobreza, corrupción, paro, falta de futuro. Todo lo demás son solo síntomas,derivados, efectos. Si tienen miedo a Podemos, combatan las causas, no las consecuencias. Publicado por Juan en 11:42:00 Etiquetas: Aznar, economia, elecciones, Felipe González, Podemos, política Hay en el silencio un algo lejano, A veces estar solo es como encontrarse a un viejo amigo: al comienzo da reparo, una luz se enciende. Y ya no piensas. Solo vives. Publicado por Juan en 19:20:00 Etiquetas: poema, poesia, soledad Me equivoco tantas veces… Yerro en los recuerdos creyendo que el color de la tarde iluminaba los rostros siempre. Falto a la verdad con estos versos que quieren agarrar este segundo. Miento dejándome llevar Falseo el verde de ese árbol, el pálido azul de un cielo triste, y la transparencia de este cuarto. Finjo, simulo, exagero… Si fuera fiel a una verdad, a una tan solo (tal vez pequeña) entonces callaría. Publicado por Juan en 19:16:00 Etiquetas: poema, poesía, tarde Durante siglos la esclavitud fue un ingrediente natural de las relaciones socioeconómicas de Occidente, hasta que un puñado de individuos en el siglo XIX, tenidos al principio por locos o antisociales, comenzó a combatirla con la fuerza de sus argumentos y sus convicciones. Pudo no haber sucedido. Sin esos valientes tal vez todavía hoy millones de seres humanos nos serían considerados personas. Pero sucedió. No por azar o por una evolución natural de las cosas. Ocurrió porque hubo quienes fueron capaces de alzar su voz y jugarse su posición social, su prestigio o incluso su vida por aquello que consideraban justo. Hasta hace no muchas décadas la pena de muerte se aplicaba cotidianamente en casi todo el planeta. Hoy, afortunadamente, ha sido erradicada de Europa, América Latina y muchos otros países del mundo. No fue tampoco aquí el cambio resultado de un proceso espontaneo; fue obra de la visión profundamente humanista inicialmente de unos pocos. La prohibición del trabajo infantil en muchas partes del mundo, el surgimiento e la conciencia medioambiental, el comienzo del fin de la opresión de minorías sexuales… todas las grandes transformaciones sociales en curso son el resultado del impulso de aquellos capaces de trascender la inmediatez, levantarse y gritar con su voz y su ejemplo: 'Así no, basta ya, esto hay que cambiarlo." Son siempre personas con nombres y apellidos, de carne y hueso, las que están detrás de los grandes cambios a favor de la democracia, de la libertad, de la justicia, del respeto, de la igualdad. A veces conocemos sus nombres, y terminan siendo aceptados en el elenco de lo

ARBOL DE GUERNICA (GUERNIKAKO ARBOLA) Desde la localidad de Cortézubi se llega a la Cueva de Santimamiñe y desde aquí al Valle de Oma, muestra de la armonía entre la naturaleza y la presencia humana. Agustín Ibarrola es un pintor español, nacido en Basauri (Vizcaya) en 1930. A los 16 años realizó su primera exposición. En 1948 la Diputación de Vizcaya y el Ayuntamiento de Bilbao le concedieron una beca para estudiar en Madrid, adonde se trasladó hasta 1955. Realizó diversas exposiciones en España y en 1955 se trasladó a París. En 1957 formó parte del grupo Equipo 57 junto a Duarte, Serrano y Cuenca, entre otros. Esta es la época del constructivismo. Detenido por su militancia anti-franquista, permaneció varios años en la prisión de Burgos. En 1963, se celebró una exposición de su obra en Londres donde sus trabajos merecieron que la crítica le comparase con el papel que desarrolló Goya en su obra Desastres de la Guerra. En la década de los 80 inició su actividad escultórica y su singular visión de la obra pictórica con el Bosque de Oma, cerca de Guernica, quizás su trabajo más conocido. Su obra conjuga el espíritu vasco con el compromiso social con los trabajadores, las gentes más humildes y tiende hacia el expresionismo. Una de sus últimas y espectaculares obras es Los Cubos de la Memoria, en el puerto de Llanes. La más pura esencia del País Vasco En el Valle de OMA, dentro de la reserva Natural de Urdaibai, los tonos Verdes dominan Todas las Vistas. El Bosque Pintado de Ibarrola pone la nota discordante con su vivo colorido. En Bizkaia, dentro de la preciosa Reserva Natural Urdaibai. Esta Reserva Natural, que barca una superficie de unos 230 Kms. cuadrados obtuvo en el año 1

Pentium, P.I (Politically Incorrect): Jesucristo es mi señor Jesucristo está en todas partes....en el canto de los pájaros..en el azul del cielo...en el buen vecino que ayuda a las viejitas a cruzar las calles. Jesucristo no está con los ladrones, con los violadores, los drogradictos, los aumentos en la gasolina y la Calle de la Amargura... Estamos mal. Pero la solución a estos males de la patria no está en la educación, en un cambio de actitud, ni mucho menos en una reforma a las leyes que benefician a los "malos" y hunden a los "buenos". No. La solución es el convertir a Jesucristo en Señor de Costa Rica!! Un proyecto de Ley presentado por 26 payasos del circo nacional, digo, diputados de la Asmablea Legislativa pretende convertir a Jesucristo en señor del país, pues "la persona de Jesucristo es elemento de unidad nacional al ser los habitantes de este país en su inmensa mayoría cristianos" (Al Dia. Nacionales. 10 de setiembre). Claro!! es que no era ciencia china!! Como nadie lo pensó antes?? Es que el dia que Jesucristo sea coronado nuestro señor soberano tanto en el espacio aereo, maritimo y terrestre, ese dia, como por arte de magia, se acabarán todos los problemas que nos están carcomiendo!!! Porque entonces la gente, antes de delinquir, de robarse la plata, de agredir, de violar, de matar; va a decir: "no! Jesucristo es nuestro señor y nos está viendo. Entonces mejor me porto bien!!" Y por arte de magia, dejarán de haber aumentos, los diputados trabajarán y todo el mundo actuará como siempre debió de actuar!!" ¡Qué sencillo es lavarse las manos y dejar todo en manos de Dios y "sus familiares"! ¡Qué fácil es delegarle las responsabilidades a los poderes divinos e ignorar el poder de discernimiento y libre alberdrío que se nos fue concedido!!! Una más de las maravillosas ideas de nuestro "padre patrios", por los cuales serán recordados con el pasar del tiempo. Parece que acaban de deshauciar a la Virgen de los Angeles...la pobre no pudo hacer nada por nosotros.... Publicadas por Pentium III de 750 MHZ a la/s 9/11/2005 02:32:00 p. m. oops. spamean tu blog, amiga. Pon word verification. :) Ridiculo el caso que relatas. Ignoraba el dato. Justo lo que el pais necesitaba: menos separacion entre religion y estado. deberian nuestros diputados ponerse a trabajar en proyectos practicos y de sentido comun. con resultados visibles a corto y mediano plazo. Creo que eso seria pedirles demasiado. :rolleyes: Estoy a favor de la tolerancia religiosa, todo el mundo tiene derecho a creer en lo q quiera, pero cuando vi esto, no pude + q pensar: Q VIEJOS + RIDICULOS!!!!! No puede ser posible, son unos bombetas! y sólo lo hacen por hacerse notar, y q le esten dando espacio p ser discutido en la asamblea me da rabia! Creo q hay cosas + importantes q decidir si Jesus es o no patrón d Costa Rica (en todos sus territorios)... RIDICULOS!!!!!!! T

Todos los componentes ideológicos de las humanidades salen a flote en esta clase de discusiones, y nos ayudan poco a comprender el verdadero meollo de la cuestión[20]. Otros, dichosamente, cumplen a plenitud con el propósito cierto de toda ciencia social y humanística, es decir ayudar a la gente a entender mejor el mundo en el que le ha tocado vivir. En los pequeños países del capitalismo periférico como Costa Rica se nota que algunas cosas están cambiando violentamente, porque casi de la noche a la mañana, quiso saltarhombre Nike Kevin Durant ext "tejida" deportivo de moda casual zapatillas 806393 001, hacia el futuro de progreso y prosperidad prometido por los ideólogos del neoliberalismo, orientando una parte importante de su estructura económica hacia la producción, promoción y expansión del turismo; pero, sin sorpresa, se encuentra hoy con que casi la mitad de sus hoteles, playas y centros de recreación para turistas está vacía. Ese mismo país se vio a sí mismo con el problema entre sus manos de que, habiendo sido tradicionalmente agrario, un grueso importante de sus exportaciones de frutas se ha contraído de manera decisiva. El desempleo lo está afectando, y con ello la criminalidad se apura a superar el ritmo que traía, debido a la desprotección de una legislación obsoleta para atender los nuevos retos que las mafias internacionales le han planteado. Esas son algunas de las consecuencias que la estrecha y paralizante dependencia de la economía norteamericana le ha ocasionado a este pequeño país que se llama Costa Rica. Mas esta serie de problemas económicos, los cuales tienenhombre SZ 14 Nike tren ultrarrápido Flyknit gris / verde zapatos para correr 843694 006, repercusiones sociales, políticas y culturales importantes en nuestra población, tienen un origen muy Caja nueva nike free tren versatilidad TB para hombres zapatos blanco negro talla 12,5 cuero,preciso. Estamos en crisis decimos: no hay créditos porque el dinero es muy caro, o sea, las tasas de interés son muy altas, se ha contraído la construcción de casas, los combustibles suben, la comida cada día es más cara, a los jóvenes se les han reducido las posibilidades de encontrar trabajo, en la profesión que tantos años de estudio les ha tomado, y, finalmente, se corre el riesgo de perder el empleo, que se ha vuelto el bien más preciado que tiene una persona hoy día. Pues bien, toda esta situación, que tanta inseguridad e incertidumbre le producen al costarricense promedio, procede de los Estados Unidos. Y veamos por qué. La economía norteamericana salió excepcionalmente fortalecida de la SegundaDS Nike Air huarache 2018 correr se "cáñamo" Phantom 10,5 retro presto Rift Woven Max, Guerra Mundial (1939-1945). Incluso se dio el lujo de crear instituciones que vigilaríanHombres Puma Future Cat M1 Citi zapatillas, nuevo BLK leather sport zapatos para caminar de 8,5, el comportamiento del capitalismo financiero de ahí en adelante, tales como el Fondo Monetario Internacional y el Banco Mundial, que fueron pensadas, en gran parte, para impedir que Estados Unidos perdiera su hegemonía sobre el sistema económico mundial. Y se dio una época de prosperidad sin precedentes en ese país, entre los años de 1948 y 1966 debida, con mucho, a las fuertes inversiones de recuperación económica que los norteamericanos habían impulsado en Europa y Asia, a través del mal conocido Plan Marshall. No sólo llegó a ser el principal acreedor del planeta, sino que también las mayores reservas de oro del mundo quedaron en sus manos. Contra tanta riqueza, los Estados Unidos empezaron a emitir masas descomunales de dólares, con los cuales prácticamente inundaron el mercado mundial, unahombre adidas Originals i-5923 inki Runner zapatos blanco / negro nuevo, estrategia pensada para compensar los indicios de contracción de su capacidad de pago en oro, debida a las demandas procedentes de las economías europeas y asiáticas que buscaban reactivar y fortalecer sus actividades bancarias y financieras. De esta forma, en la década siguiente, los años setenta, el dólar entró en crisis, y aceleró una revisión del sistema monetario y del sistema internacional de pagos. Con la guerra de Viet-Nam (1969-1975), Estados Unidos intentó contra pesar el impacto que la situación estaba generando en su capacidad de acumulación y en el proceso de reproducción capitalista, puesto que la crisis del dólar (1974-1977) era simplemente el síntoma de un mal mayor: la acerada tendencia que tiene la economía norteamericana al sobre endeudamiento y al sobre consumo, a través de los cuales se crea a sí misma cuellos de botella que son, finalmente, desbloqueados por la economía internacional. Es decir, Estados Unidos desvaloriza el dólar y dehombre nike air max invigor Negro Talla 9 buen estado,esta manera les pasa la factura a las economías emergentes y dependientesAdidas Yeezy Boost 350 V2 mantequilla comodo, o semi coloniales[21]. La crisis de la deuda en América Latina (1980-1982) formó parte de este proceso, con el cual la economía norteamericana buscó remontar sus propios problemas financieros internos. Cuando, durante estos años, los países latinoamericanos se declararon insolventes, fue porque las corporaciones bancarias internacionales, con residencia en Estados Unidos, habían acelerado el proceso de endeudamiento de estos países para financiar su propio patrón de crecimiento. Esto no ha cambiado hasta el presente. De acuerdo con los neoliberales dicha estrategia financiera era perfectamente normal, puesto que, desde finales de los años setenta, venían sosteniendo que hombre Nike Max Uptempo' 95 en QS 922932-400 comodo,la menor ingerencia del Estado en los negocios, era la actitud más saludable para que deudores y acreedores saldaran sus desacuerdos sin traumas ni conflictos escandalosos. Resulta, sin embargo, que el endeudamiento externo hizo colapsar a la economía latinoamericana, provocando un retroceso descomunal en áreas tan decisivas, socialmente hablando, como vivienda, acueductos, educación y salud. El desplome de economías, otrora tan progresistas como la argentina, la mexicana y la brasileña, fue un espectáculo que dejó lecciones todavía insalvables, y que explican mayormente, el auge de la economía social que se está operando en América Latina hoy. Los años ochenta, por su lado, la década perdida en América Latina, son también, al mismo tiempo, aquellos durante los cuales cristalizó una readecuación importante Adidas zx Flux negro / Power Morado mujer Talla 8 Athletic zapatos,de las economías hegemónicas a escala internacional. Con su fracaso en la guerra de Viet-Nam, los Estados Unidos tendrían que negociar con la vieja Unión Soviética y con China la distribución geoestratégica que le esperaría al mundo del siglo XXI, donde una Alemania y un Japón con nuevos bríos emergerían para participar, como en el pasado, en el reparto del botín. Igualmente en la URSS, con la Perestroika de 1984, tendría lugar un ajuste de Hombres Adidas EQT de Apoyo de mediados de ADV PK cq2999 primeknit negro / amarillo - reducción de precios,cuentas sin precedentes en la historia universal de los imperios, puesAuthentic nike air jordan 1 Mid 811124-035 Air Jordan 1 retro de mediados de alta baja, se trataba del primero que cometía suicidio y repartía los pedazos al mejor postor. En 1989, China también experimentaba la primera gran sacudida de un modelo de desarrollo económico-social y político que empezaba a operar en dos vertientes, no siempre armónicas, la economía y la institucionalidad política, como se verá después, durante los años noventa, cuando la restauración capitalista despegaba con consecuencias sociales todavía por verse. En la década siguiente, en los Estados Unidos, Gran Bretaña, Japón y otrasCg2976 adidas mujer ultraboost OLIVA OLIVA x noche trazas carga Tech Rust, potencias industriales, así como en China, el nuevo "taller del mundo", se desataba un auge espectacular de la construcción, que solo hacía más notoria una de las contradicciones históricas del sistema capitalista: el problema de la sobre producción y el sub consumo. El sobre endeudamiento y el sobre consumo, por su parte, como corolarios de aquella contradicción básica, evidenciaban, que la llamada "burbuja financiera", el capital ficticio, que no siempre tiene relación directa con la economía real, era una nueva forma de expresarse la sincronía alcanzada, a través de la globalización financiera, de las economías centrales a escala mundial. La crisis asiática de 1997 y el "efecto tequila", procedenteEfimera Racer Azul / blanco Hombres Nike talla US 5 nuevos 100% autentico, de México en 1995, así lo hacían notar. En pocas palabras, lo que queremos decir Hyperdunk 2018 Nike baloncesto Carolina Tarheel Azul / blanco talla 8,5,es que hoy, más que nunca antes, una crisis en el centro capitalista, tiene efectos directos en las otras economías ancilares y periféricas del sistema. Y para continuar hablando de burbujas, la "burbuja inmobiliaria" será también uno de los detonantes de la crisis en Japón y México. Hubo momentos en que en el centro de Tokyo un metro cuadrado de construcción costaba US$300,000. Para construir, sin embargo, se requerían grandes masas de crédito, y para que éste estuviera disponible se necesitaban ciertos patrones de consumo y rentabilidad y ésta, a su vez, estaba en relación directa, supuestamente, con la capacidad productiva de la economía que la hacía posible. Pero, si el grueso del dinero en los bancos y financieras norteamericanos es capital-dinero procedente de inversionistas asiáticos hombre Adidas ultra Boost St hombres corredores / zapatillas de deporte / fitness / zapatillas de entrenamiento,y europeos, o de corporaciones multinacionales con sede en los Estados Unidos, para hacerlo circular hay que pagarle elevadas tasas de interés al verdadero propietario de tales capitales, con lo cual el sistema bancario norteamericano se torna en uno de los más endeudados del planeta y su población asume igual condición de endeudamiento. En algún punto de la cadena crediticia, esta situación hará crisis puesto que la capacidad productiva Adidas Yeezy Boost 350 v2semi frozenAmarillo reducción de precio,de la sociedad, sus patrones de acumulación, quedarán por debajo dehombre Nike Air Zoom Baseball / softball de metal nuevo comodo, las demandas y expectativas del capital financiero, de tal forma que la brecha se superará de forma ficticia acudiendo al sobre consumo y estrangulando a la gente con préstamos y más préstamos…¡Es la edad de oro de las tarjetas de crédito, de los automóviles de lujo del año, de las grandes mansiones con piscina, de los viajes turísticos familiares a carísimos hoteles en las playas de Costa Rica!

Speech of Insulza to the 5th SIRG ministerial Dirección de América del Norte, Central, Caribe y Asuntos Hernisféricos DISCURSO DEL MINISTRO DE RELACIONES EXTERIORES DE CHILE, SEÑOR JOSÉ MIGUEL INSULZA EN LA XVII REUNION DEL GRUPO DE REVISION DE LA IMPLEMENTACION DE CUMBRES (GRIC) CIUDAD DE GUATEMALA, 7 DE JUNIO DE 1999 Es para mi un agrado inaugurar la segunda reunión a nivel de Cancilleres del Grupo de Revisión de la Implementación de Cumbres, después de la Cumbre de Santiago. El propósito de nuestro encuentro es efectuar una revisión general del proceso de implementación y seguimiento de los mandatos contenidos en el Plan de Acción de la II Cumbre de las Américas e intercambiar puntos de vista respecto a nuestro trabajo futuro. Desde nuestra reunión de Caracas, hemos avanzado vigorosamente en el cumplimiento de los compromisos asumidos por nuestros Jefes de Estado y de Gobierno en Santiago. Ello ha quedado de manifiesto en las reuniones realizadas por los Coordinadores Nacionales en octubre de 1998 en Washington y en marzo de este año en República Dominicana, en las que revisaron los avances en diez de los veintisiete temas de Plan de Acción. Para implementar el capítulo "Educación: La Clave para el Progreso", los Ministros de Educación de las Américas se reunieron en Brasilia, en julio de 1998, y aprobaron el Plan de Implementación del Capítulo Educación del Plan de Acción de la Cumbre, y su Mecanismo de Seguimiento, para cumplir con los mandatos de los Jefes de Estado y de Gobierno en este ámbito. Aprobaron, asimismo, el Programa Interamericano de Educación, en cuyo contexto se han concretado ya seis iniciativas; y consideraron el trabajo del Grupo Interagencial que busca facilitar la cooperación de los organismos internacionales para el financiamiento de proyectos en materia educativa. En relación al caplítulo sobre "Preservación y Fortalecimiento de la Democracia, la Justicia y los Derechos Humanos", se revisaron los avances en diversos temas. En materia de Corrupción, se realizó en noviembre de 1998, en Santiago, el Simposio para el Fortalecimiento de la Probidad en el Hemisferio, que permitió el intercambio de experiencias sobre las instituciones y normas nacionales de los Estados miembros sobre probidad y ética cívica, consideró la experiencia de los organismos internacionales en la lucha contra la corrupción, la cooperación para el fortalecimiento institucional y la participación de la Sociedad Civil en este propósito. Mañana la Asamblea General considerará el seguimiento de estas actividades. En materia de lucha contra las drogas ilícitas, en el ámbito de CICAD se han realizado avances importantes en la aplicación de la Estrategia Antidrogas del Hemisferio. El Grupo de Trabajo sobre el Mecanismo de Evaluación Multilateral (MEM) ha dado pasos decisivos en la conformación de los indicadores y procesos de operación del MEM. Después de cinco períodos de reuniones se está por concluir el mandato que le fuera encomendado y el año 2000 comenzaremos a ponerlo en aplicación. La II Conferencia Especializada Interamericana sobre Terrorismo, celebrada en noviembre de 1998 en Mar del Plata, Argentina, recomendó la creación de un Comité Interamericano contra el Terrorismo, con el propósito de prevenir, combatir y eliminar los actos y actividades terroristas. Mañana la Asamblea General de la O.E.A., establecerá este nuevo órgano de cooperación interamericano. Para avanzar en el cumplimiento de los mandatos sobre "Fortalecimiento del Sistema de Justicia y de los Organos Judiciales", los Ministros de Justicia de las Américas se reunieron en Lima, en marzo de este año, considerando especialmente los temas de acceso a la Justicia, formación de jueces, fiscales y funcionarios judiciales, política carcelaria y penitenciaria, así como el fortalecimiento de la cooperación interamericana en este ámbito. Los Ministros asignaron a un grupo de expertos intergubernamentales la tarea de completar los estudios para establecer un Centro de Estudios de Justicia de las Américas. Con el propósito de avanzar en el cumplimiento de los mandatos sobre "Modernización del Estado en materias laborales", los Ministros del Trabajo de las Américas se reunieron en Viña del Mar, Chile, en octubre de 1998, y definieron en su Plan de Acción de Viña del Mar como prioridades los temas de empleo y mercado de trabajo, relaciones laborales y seguridad social. Asimismo establecieron dos grupos de trabajo, uno de los cuales estará específicamente dedicado a la "Modernización del Estado y de la Administración Laboral". Hoy y mañana debemos aprobar importantes propuestas dentro de la Asamblea General en otros dos temas de este capítulo, en "Sociedad Civil" la creación de la Comisión sobre la Participación de la Sociedad Civil en las actividades de la O.E.A.; y en 'Fomento de la Confianza y Seguridad entre los Estados", la Convención sobre Transparencia en la Adquisición de Armas Convencionales, nuevo paso pionero de las Américas en materia de cooperación para la Seguridad. También se han registrado avances significativos en el capítulo "Integración Económica y Libre Comercio". El establecimiento del Area de Libre Comercio de las Américas (ALCA) es tal vez la iniciativa económica más interesante y ambiciosa de alcance hemisférico. El proceso de negociación del ALCA se encuentra actualmente en una fase técnica. La falta de autorización para negociar por la vía rápida (fast-track), es un límite para el principal socio comercial hemisférico, aunque hasta ahora no ha impedido el desarrollo de las negociaciones en esta fase. Los efectos de la crisis financiera en los países de la región, también han repercutido en las negociaciones del ALCA, pero éste ha sido precisamente un foro útil para evitar rebrotes de proteccionismo. Los grupos de negociación establecidos: Acceso a Mercados, Agricultura, Servicios, Inversión; Subsidios, Antidumping y Derechos Compensatorios; Política de Competencia, Compras del Sector Público, Propiedad Intelectual, y Solución de Controversias, han estado funcionando satisfactoriamente, avanzando en el plan de trabajo que se les encomendó. Se espera que para final de año los grupos preparen un informe anotado con una visión global de lo que será la negociación en cada uno de los temas respectivos; se podrá, en algunos, contar con índices de los eventuales capítulos y en otros con listas de los temas consensuados que se negociarán. Asimismo, podemos destacar el trabajo interesante del Comité de Comercio Electrónico, integrado por representantes del sector público y privado, que se ha abocado al estudio y a la elaboración de recomendaciones para los Ministros en este campo importante y novedoso. En el caso del Comité sobre la Sociedad Civil, se ha dado cumplimiento a las funciones encomendadas, extendiendo una amplia invitación a la Sociedad Civil a presentar sus puntos de vista sobre estas negociaciones comerciales. Se han hecho 72 presentaciones, las cuales se están analizando y procesando en estos días. Las medidas de facilitación del comercio, que se terminarán de acordar en estos próximos meses, serán un primer resultado del proceso ALCA. En la lista de medidas, sugeridas por distintos países, por el Foro Empresarial del ALCA y por los grupos de trabajo, destacan las relacionadas con los procedimientos aduaneros, sobre las cuales existen mayores niveles de consenso y que seguramente serán aprobadas para su pronta implementación. El éxito del proceso del ALCA depende, como todas las negociaciones comerciales, de una adecuada coordinación del sector público y del sector privado. Esperamos seguir contando con una activa participación del mundo empresarial en este proceso de mediano y largo plazo. Esperarnos que estos avances se concreten en la Reunión Ministerial de Toronto, Canadá, el próximo mes de noviembre. En materia de Cooperación Energética Regional se han llevado a cabo dos reuniones de los Grupos de Trabajo en la materia. En junio de 1998 se llevó a cabo en Trinidad y Tobago la Primera Reunión del Comité Guía de la Iniciativa Hemisférica en Energía, encuentro en el cual se identificaron una serie de recomendaciones y acciones orientadas a mejorar el proceso de cooperación energética en el Hemisferio y se acordaron las tareas que los países realizarán en conjunto con el objeto de implementar los mandatos del Plan de Acción. En fecha próxima se efectuará la IV Reunión de Ministros de Energía, en la cual se verificarán los avances alcanzados en materia de integración energética. Los Ministros de Transportes de las Américas aprobaron en New Orleans, en diciembre pasado, los objetivos y estrategias necesarias para concretar la visión integradora del Transporte en el Hemisferio Occidental, identificaron áreas prioritarias de acción, y determinaron consolidar la estructura y el papel de la Iniciativa de Transporte del Hemisferio Occidental (ITHO). En la oportunidad también se adoptó un Memorándum de Consultas para la Respuesta a los Desastres en la América Central y el Caribe. En el marco de la CITEL, las autoridades de telecomunicaciones han cooperado activamente en el desarrollo y actualización de un Plan Regional de Infraestructura de Comunicaciones. Las autoridades de Hacienda han continuado su cooperación en el fortalecimiento, modernización e integración de los mercados financieros en sus encuentros con ocasión de las reuniones del Banco Mundial y del BID. En relación al capítulo IV "Erradicación de la Pobreza y la Discriminación", los Coordinadores Nacionales han revisado los avances en los temas de Tecnologías de Salud, especialmente en lo que se refiere al acceso de medicamentos y vacunas de calidad, el fortalecimiento de los sistemas de información y supervisión, la extensión del acceso al agua potable y a la infraestructura de saneamiento y el mejoramiento de la calidad de esos servicios, de acuerdo a lo informado por la Organización Panamericana de la Salud. Por último, el tema "Derechos Básicos de los Trabajadores" fue incluido por los Ministros del Trabajo en sus deliberaciones de la Conferencia de Viña del Mar. Los informes rendidos por los Coordinadores Responsables de cada tema, dan cuenta detallada de un sistemático proceso de ejecución de los mandatos con amplia participación de los países del hemisferio, y con un creciente apoyo de los organismos internacionales involucrados. En Caracas se constituyó' oficialmente la "Troika", la que ha coordinado el proceso de seguimiento de la ejecución de los mandatos de la Cumbre, organizando las reuniones del GRIC, de manera de permitir un cabal intercambio de puntos de vista entre autoridades y expertos, en beneficio del mejor cumplimiento y proyección de los compromisos hemisféricos. Estas reuniones han contado con informes escritos presentados por los Coordinadores responsables y por los organismos internacionales que participan en el proceso. Hemos mantenido una activa y fluida relación con la Secretaría General de la Organización de Estados Americanos, lo que ha permitido un trabajo dinámico y efectivo que ha redundado en un real apoyo a la labor de la Troika. El Secretario General de la O.E.A., doctor César Gaviria, a fin de dar cumplimiento a las responsabilidades que se asignaron a la Organización en materia de Seguimiento de Cumbres, ha adoptado distintas medidas, como el establecimiento de la Oficina de Seguimiento de Cumbres (OSC). Esta ha creado un registro documental que se encuentra incorporado a una pagina Web, que contiene toda la documentación oficial del proceso, abierta a la consulta general. Se ha convertido también en la Secretaría Técnica de la Comisión Especial de Gestión de Cumbres Interamericanas del Consejo Permanente de la O.E.A., y colabora activamente con este Grupo de Revisión de la Implementación de Cumbres (GRIC). Agradezco al Secretario General doctor Gaviria el dinamismo, imaginación y responsabilidad con que la Secretaría General ha asumido estas labores, como asimismo el apoyo constante que viene prestando al proceso. Agradecemos también la colaboración de la Organización Panamericana de la Salud (OPS), y la progresiva incorporación de la CEPAL en los temas técnicos en los que apoya la ejecución de los mandatos de nuestros Jefes de Estado y de Gobierno. Apreciamos el interés con que el Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo (BID) y el Banco Mundial han asumido su colaboración con los programas de desarrollo contenidos en el Plan de Acción de la Cumbre. Nos interesa enfatizar la importancia del apoyo financiero de estas instituciones. Esperamos que la creciente coordinación entre nuestros gobiernos, incluidos sus representantes en este Grupo de Revisión de la Implementación de Cumbres, y estas entidades, pueda contribuir a lograr el cumplimiento de los objetivos que han aprobado los Jefes de Es

Asesinan a sujeto con 5 disparos – El Noticiero de Manzanillo | El Noticiero de Colima Asesinan a sujeto con 5 disparos Con 4 disparos de arma de fuego en el tórax y uno más en el antebrazo derecho, un sujeto fue asesinado en la comunidad de Puertecito, en Armería. El cuerpo del agraviado se encontraba en un domicilio cercano a la carretera Armería – Rincón de López, junto a la entrada al poblado. El sujeto, identificado como Roberto Vega Figueroa, de 53 años de edad, tenía su domicilio en la comunidad de Puertecito, en Armería. El hallazgo se realizó poco después de la medianoche de hoy sábado. Según la escena, la casa donde se encontraba el cadáver no tenía puertas ni ventanas. El lugar estaba deteriorado. El lugar estaba oscuro por la falta de energía eléctrica. Y un metro después de la entrada principal del inmueble, se encontraba el cadáver de Vega Figueroa. Este estaba boca arriba, y vestía una camisa color blanco con azul, bermuda de mez
