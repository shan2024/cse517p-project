you cant walk up there you got to run theres no way you can walk and you have to botmce you land flatfooted like this you see you cant bend your knees so you land flatfooted like this and yo
thats why your plss comes in handy 06 18 52 52 kmp yes and so then you so that means you can take turns but you have to have your center of gravity over your over your foot so you end up going rocking from side to side its real funny you go like this way over because w
go bong bon
center of gravity and and its fun you c
except i noticed we didnt get too speedy coming up o
yes because because we kept running on the edge we didnt just hit one we you cant we all heres how we were running coming out of that surveyor crater you cant do that so it just took one high bounce to get us up high if you dont go up all the way on it com

hou
y
im looking at the contrast chart in the sun and i can see all the different shades and ive taken a photo of it now look at the one in the shadow in the shadow i can see well depends on how close i am if im within about 3 feet of it or feet of it i can see all six shades ill take a picture here th
let me as

ma
sto
okay houston i looked im looking at the con trast chart in the shadow and as i mentioned at 3 feet i can see all six if i back up maybe to 10 feet as long as i stand here a moment and adapt nv eyes i can see all six also now the thing that seems to have the biggest effect on it is how low the sun is the sun is high now and so i dont have to squint my eyes particularly looking in that direction yesterday looking into the same crater even though it wouldnt be any darker in there because the sun was there i could i would never be abl
i can
roger al 05 12 07 26 l the only major difference ive noticed is the fact that when your
copy that al 05 12 07 58 okay ill take some pictures here of the solar wind for you 05 12 08 13 p it doesnt look as pronounced wrapped around the pole now that i get out here houston it looks pretty much like yesterday just sort of i guess it was sort of an opt
roger al and pete if its convenient a
okay i was setting up my rock hole and all that good things fo
okay al ar
thats affirm im now making sure that everything is in the to
o
im mounting them pretty firmly hey houston as i was working around the handtool carrier a moment ago the canvas bag came loose it took me about 2 minut
roger al we copy that do you think once you put a lit
i dont know they dont the they dont seem to have a lot of friction on the sides there and the bag just floats around it it needs to be more firmly att
oka
ro
ye
where ar
im just lea
o
boy this handtool carrier is is light and nic
i can see anything everything from finegrain basalt as i come running across the area here to coarse a few coarsegrain ones i see some s
roger al we copy that and pete ca
i got it going jus
rog
im taking the polarized pictures right now but al when you get up to me if youll just st
okay i
get me a stereopair of this good well use the tongs h
its right exactly this is a very small crater houston probably about 3 feet in diameter and looks like it was made at not very fastmoving or energetic or heavy projectile yet right in confidential the middle of the hole is some of these glass covered rock fragments and on some of the other rocks that seemed to be rested in the hole im putting them all in a sample bag 1 here i mean some of the others dont have any coating on them at all im picking them up with the tongs but i cant tell how strong they are but they dont seem they dont seem to hold together too well they seem k
roger al we copy that if youre going to document that try to get some of the material around the glass as w
okay i want to ill just get this as a bonus and i want to get over here to start working with pete as a team here just didnt want to have to try to remember where th
r
youre going to get a big surprise when you look into this head crater al its a beck of a lot deeper th
ok
heres a nice white small crate
ive been concentrating houston as i came walk ing over here to head crater to see if there wer
slow up dont don
okay ill stop right here r
okay put the tool carrier down and get get your upsun pictures you see where my footsteps are that rock thats half buried and the two rocks that ive turned over in my footstep
ye
okay its 15 feet fll two shots now youre not going to get the before unfortunately 05 12 15 4 lmp okay how about right be
no tha
no right here i
right straight in front of me this rock pile right here 05 12 16 07 oh okay want me to sh
yes and you arent 15 feet back up you
okay got those two got a couple of pictures there houston let me tell you what my camera reading is now and then we can try to keep up with it fro
yes houston ive shot three six nine 12 15 15 pi
copy 15 pete 05 12 17 oh cdr okay and on my mark im going to send a slightly smaller rock into th

thats sample b
copy your mark al or pete and 1d on that sampl
you know its a funny thing houston in one si
okay pete i need y

okay they wanted it look itve got an area right over here that looks li
these little white spatterlike cr
yes t
let me go over her

well get them in a lit

let me get over here and get the gnomon and a sample of this rock right here this rock is very typical of all the fragments a
oka
hey that
boy sur
yes thats interesting thats the firs
in fact you know what it looks like here it looks like it may be this darker material wel
im going to photograph that too let me get cidnfidentia 6 05 12 20 2 cdr okay 05 12 20 h3 lvp let me get this houston kind of interesting here pete walked across one edge of the rim here were about oh 50 feet inside the the upper rim and he happen

yes le

here let me g

i need th
ail right ill hold the to
yes let me have the handle 05 12 22 38 p need the hand
wait a minut
ca
okay move over here w
o
very interesting things about this side of the mountain i mean this side of the crater is that these boulders arent uniformly distributed around they all seem to be over here on the western side if you look over th eastern side or the north or south you can see some bu
h
ro
okay 05 2 23 29 cdr look at t
in that white soil with the brow
y
th
we get some photos of th
okay look you can see where you dug in that theres still some under you why dont you give me another scoop right in there 05 12 23 h cdr okay a good idea 05 12 23 h6 l theres not much in here okay ere pete digs up sure enough right underneath the surface you find some much lighter gray boy i dont exactly know why at this point and you can look around now and see several places where weve walked that the same things occurred we never have seen this at all boy thats going to make a goo
roger al we copy that you think it could be the sun angle 05 12 2l 25 l listen no not at all this is definitely a changeto light gray as you go down and the deeper pete goes hes down about 4 inches now it s
say this is different than around the spacecraft because weve kicked up all ki
top and bottom this is quite a b
b
i tell you wh
wha
why dont yo
de
yes dig as deep as you can then get me a sample right out of the bottom because this will be something new ill put it in sample bag numbe
kind of har
al we copy 5d and would you give your location relative to the center of head crater specifi cally are you just on the west side of it where we have the triple crater 05 12 25 22 l we arent wer
right wh
give me another shovelful there p
roger you should be very close to t
triple crater we
theres a couple of craters r
thats not a good one al let me get another one tfr4dnfidentiaili 6 c5 12 25 47 l down about 6 inches and looks just light gray down there now in the bag youll fnd theres some d
hey i wa
lets throw this little rock in that i dug up from down dee
y
ok
get another sample bag 05 12 26 09 l ail right 05 12 26 0 cdr thats a good one because i dont want 05 12 26 i1 lmp well wait a minute let me get a picture of it first 05 12 26 il cdr i dug it u out of a hole its hard to keep this soil in the bag stereopair okay in bag d 05 12 26 30 l theres of course a li
the minute you bump the side it falls in 05 12 26 40 lmi its not cohesive at all even though it it seems to remain nearly vertical i guess its the low gravity hey thats a nice rock pete just hand
o
okay thats g
okay as you move off pete every once in a while i can see some white but most of the time hey you kicked over a rock that had a white bottom quite a bit different than the top right behind you you might you might want to take a picture of that its quite a bit dif ferent tha
hous
because it looks like we could just spend all our time he
thats wh
pete we show that youre 58 minutes into the eva and wed like to get you over to bench crater and leaving there something on the order of 1 plu
okay al wh
got t
by the way this is the smartest idea we came up with housto
okay le
this i
let me let me u
ail right now im trying to find the triple craters theyre referring to 05 12 28 1 lmp kick it around be righ
oka
okay now theres a good picture pete let me get that on
wait a minute you got it in your shadow 05 12 29 35 lp i do take another one pete maybe you want it 05 12 29 h3 cdr even these rocks out in here even the ones that are al
ail right let me have that 05 12 29 54 livp theres your tube 05 12 29 55 cd a
her
he
ye
the were ap
oh look look at these crat
b
now h
pete we suggest yo
well do it at bench its really a shame houst
rog
we could we could work out here fo
i to
were not going to get to that other one bench is it but that look
im kind of wondering were passing up these here and they got to be bedrock from somewhere we need to get a pretty largesized one here be fore we leave this area pete 05 12 31 5 cdr ill tell you what well do is ill stop right here and take a pan nfidentia 6 cj 12 31 49 lp 0kay jj 12 31 50 cdr hows that grab you 05 2 31 53 l because these rocks obviously came out of the crater becaus
okay now back to rock
this o
thi
no right there a little bit further that one right there ill just grab it and pu
this o
the b
ho ho ho wait until i get t
okay if we can do that we can just put it in the bag i think thats kind of a different looking rock this rock is different houston ju
o
ro
sor
thats al
oka
that a boy we know you got the rock thats wha
okay put it in the bag 05 12 34 28 i2p th
good rock onfidentiat fige 290 day 6 io sa 6 ip and this is probably typical of the rocks around this crater houston so it will be a good sample for us 05 ii 3 51 l id say in the area were moving along now as we head south is what do you say pete theres about 5 percent rocks c5 7 cc something like th yes they go anywhere from 212 3 f
okay lets do lets jp o 35 15 h in fact maybe we s
got to back around it 05 12 25 33 wellrounded got a lot of surface pits in it i can see the glitter 05 12 35 ho cdi i ot to hack off to 15 feet on this o
get a good stereosair 0 12 c 4 12c okay 55p sj 27 cdr eont want tc fall down in t
do
roger al we copy that are you able to find an
this is not unlike all the other rocks around here houston all the rocks are just ab
al d
yes lets get that thats a good idea ai
sure does looks about equal too do
it looks about equal thats right very i
heres something here go ahead i want to look here for a second 05 12 36 34 l if you look real closely at the rock the surface of it is coarse pitted and theres some pits that are maybe even up to threeeighths of an inch in diameter on it however most of them are small it doesnt look like a basalt although the grains are too small for me to see anything identify any specific one some of the pits have glass in it which is not too surprising and many of them dont thats about all we can say about that rock houston and thats typical of the of th
roger al could you give us a sample bag number and then press on 05 12 37 t8 lmp okay well we didnt take a sample there the couple that we did take a sample of previously are the same types so the last couple of samples have been of the same type rocks that were dis cussing 12 37 130 cdr okay houston im coming up on bench crater right now i loped off and left al and ill get you a pan in bench crater this looks like a very in teresting crater its different oh and i see some really different rocks a big one hey that looks like bedrock g
we kicked out of this crater 05 12 39 03 p im just sorry you gu
at a fantastic sight al look in the bottom of that crater c5 12 39 10 4p n
do y
well it looks to me those rocks look w
yes but dont hey look melted on the top dont they look like they

i know i c
were estimating a diameter of sharp crater pete f
al t
this is it its got to be it its go

okay for today wed like you on p23 to make a trunnion bias determination prior to p23 sightings as called out in procedures and also one afterwards our intent here is to check out the possibility that some sort of thermal effect may be giving you errors in the angular readout in the sextant the bias that you get beforehand should be incorporated that is a proceed on noun 87 after you get two consecutive measure ments equal to within 0003 degrees and of course move the trunnion off a couple of degrees between the measurements the earth should be a lot smaller in your field of view today im sure youre a lot more qualified to tell us about that than we are but to ensure that youre getting a good angle measurement between the star and the earth horizon the sextant mline which is the line that runs through the two hash marks and is perpendicular to the rline should be parallel to the earth horizon at the substellar point and then the actual super imposition of the star upon the horizon can be made at any point in the field of view of the sextant above below or on the mline we recommend the marks be made as rapidly as possible after auto maneuver if you fee

looks like the best way to get a steady view through the monocular is just steady it out and let it close when its in front of your eye and then you kind of float up next to it so that youre not touching it at all it has a very slow drift a

tranquility houston first question here is how your best estimate of the yaw on the of the lm as comp
we got 13 degrees left on the ball and i think tranq thats probably about right looking at the shadow and so on we prob probably about 13 de grees left of t
roger thats 13 degrees left of the shadow and next question relates to the dep
im not sure i understand that question but we tranq got a good bit of the ground mass in t
roger neil one of the implications here is the depth from which the b
we got some down from as much as 3 inches in the tran
roger be zieve we understand down as deep as 3 inches did not hit any hard bed and no significant changes in composition to that depth next question the the second src was packed rather hurriedly due to the time limitation and wonder if you would be able to pr
we got two core tubes and solar wind an
roger neil next topic here relates to the rays which emanate from the dps e
the ones that i saw back in the aft end of the tranq spacecraft appeared to be a good bit darker of course view
roger understand that near the aft end out to the east that the rays did appear darker i understand buzz that these were this was the appearance of the material which had been uncovered by the rays that appeared darker for 2 or 3 feet extending outward is that correct 04 18 3849 lmp no i wouldnt say it was necessarily materia
roger tranquility and this baked appearance that you described at least the suggestion is that it w
i be
roger next subject did either of the solar panels on the pse touch the surface of the moon during deployment over i0t nii1 llp 71t page 42j 04 18 40 19 lmp i think that two corners did touch since when it tranq was deployed both of them didnt come out at the same time it unfolded a little unevenly a
roger understand the description there and the next subject on the two core tubes which you collected how did the driving fozce re quired to collect thes
not significantly i could get down to about tranq th
roger buzz i think ive got the picture you indicate that little difference between the two samples and that in each cas
yes thats about it it wasnt a rapid chang
yes indeed thatll be fine ju
well i could do it like this owen about all tranq th
roger understand neil next topic as just after landing you pointed out that there was a hill to the west along the plusz axis from the lm are there any large rocks in that direction that might block the solar ray during the sunset as s
no i dont believe so i think th
roge
theres nothing large anyway thats going to tranq get in the w
roger copy thats also the way it appeared from the television think and now the final question you commented neil that on your approach to the landing spot you had passed over a football fieldsized crater containing rather large blocks of solid rock perhaps 10 to 15 feet in size can you estimate the distance to this footballsized crater from yotupresent position over gossnetl tape748 i h6 25 cdr thmfh wd b 1o cmgh s thfl when w iliant gol ulidt wt ould il rim bruk ibcr bul i couthtlt bul dtmt illid thsul wtt ilole llfli ltltk mi

good evening id like to discuss with you a few of the more symbolic aspects of the flight of our mission apollo 11 as weve been dis cussing the events that have taken place in the past 2 or 3 days here on board our spacecraft weve come to the conclusion that this has been far more than three men on a voyage to the moon more still than the efforts of a government and industry team more even than the efforts of one nation we feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown nells statement the other day upon first setting foot on the surface of the moon this is a small step for a man but a great leap for mankind i believe sum up these feelings very nicely we accepted the challenge of going to the moon the acceptance oj this challenge was inevita01e the relatiw ease with which we carried out our mission i beieve is a tribute to the timeliness of that acteptance today i feel were flly capable of accepting expanded roles in the exploration of stace in retrospect we have all been particularly pleased with the call signs that we very laboriously goss net 1 ape 1124 chose for our spacecraft columbia and eagle weve been particularly pleased with the emblem of our flight depicting the us eagle bringing the universal sym
the responsibility for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort next with the american people who have thrugh their will indicated their desire next o four administrations and their congresses folimplementing that will and then to the agelcy and industry teams that built our spacecraft the saturn the columbia the eagle and the 1 ttle emu the space suit and backpack that waour small spacecraft out on the lunar surfacer we would like to give a special thanks to althose americans who built the spacecraft who aid the construction design the tests and put their their hearts and all their abilities into those c
